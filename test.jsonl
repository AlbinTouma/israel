Additionally, during the second ceasefire between February 1 and March 17 of this year, 4,259 Gazans — including patients, wounded individuals, and their family members — were evacuated from the Strip for medical treatment abroad.\nLeaving Gaza requires international intervention\nIsrael’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the body under the Defense Ministry responsible for coordinating the movement of Gaza residents, has maintained that the only criteria for exiting Gaza — both before and throughout the war — are severe illness or injury, or foreign citizenship. In all cases, residents cannot apply directly to COGAT; an international organization must submit the request on their behalf.\nIt is notable that many countries accepting patients from Gaza during the war, including the UAE and various European states, have clarified that these are temporary stays for medical treatment and that the individuals are expected to return afterward.\nRelated: Almost half of Gaza Palestinians willing to ask Israel to help them leave — poll\nSince the war began, the World Health Organization has been responsible for coordinating the evacuation of patients and their companions from the Gaza Strip. From November 2023 to May 2024, evacuations occurred via the Rafah crossing into Egypt. Following the Israeli ground operation in Rafah on May 6, 2024, the crossing was closed.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn June 2024, Israel began allowing patients to exit Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Israel and then into Jordan by vehicle via the Allenby Bridge.

Since last February, some Gazan patients have been allowed to fly directly from Israel via Ramon Airport in the Negev in the south of Israel. (Until then, Ramon Airport in southern Israel was not used for international flights.)\nThe WHO publishes an online chart that is updated every few weeks to show the number of individuals evacuated from Gaza. According to the data, from the collapse of the ceasefire on March 18 until May 6, a total of 310 people — patients and companions — were evacuated.\nForeign nationals still waiting to exit\nTo exit Gaza as a foreign citizen — including dual citizens —  during the war, the individual’s country must submit a formal request to COGAT and provide proof of citizenship and presence in Gaza. Gazan residents cannot request exit permits from Israel directly.\nWhen the Rafah crossing was open from November 2023 to May 2024, foreign nationals used it to reach Egypt. Most were asked to pay between $2,000 and $5,000 per person to Egyptian companies managing the crossing.\nNotably, even Gazans without foreign citizenship were able to leave by paying the same amount, including senior Hamas figures such as the Hamas-run health ministry spokesperson, Ashraf al-Qudra, who reportedly exited the Strip this way during the war.\nA Palestinian stranded in Egypt waits to cross Rafah crossing to the Gaza Strip at Rafah, Egypt, after a temporary truce came into effect, November 27, 2023.

COGAT confirmed to The Times of Israel that eligibility was strictly limited to holders of foreign citizenship, not those with visas or other legal residency forms.\nPalestinians wait to board a bus at Al-Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis after permission from the Israeli authorities was given for 11 children suffering from cancer to leave Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing to receive treatment in Jordan, August 15, 2024.

His wife and two daughters live in Europe, where he has resided for the past decade. He requested that his full name and identifying details not be published.\nIn September 2023, Ahmad traveled to Gaza for a family visit. Once the war broke out, he attempted to leave and return home. His first attempt via Rafah was denied by Israel on the grounds of “security concerns.” Later, with legal assistance from Gisha, he petitioned Israel’s High Court of Justice to leave. Israel responded after long months that it had no objection to his departure, and a week after the petition was withdrawn, his exit via Kerem Shalom crossing was coordinated.\nAhmad left Gaza after 15 months of trying, despite holding foreign citizenship and having immediate family abroad.\nIn a WhatsApp conversation with The Times of Israel, Ahmad described the experience as deeply frustrating: “Throughout the process, the official bodies responsible for handling this had failed. The citizen is the last priority.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nGazans leave following requests by foreign governments\nDespite official Israeli statements asserting that only foreign nationals or individuals in need of urgent medical care are allowed to exit Gaza, approximately 290 Gaza residents have left the Strip since the March collapse of the ceasefire. According to foreign media reports, official statements, and a source familiar with the issue who spoke with The Times of Israel, they left through foreign government intervention and not for medical reasons, and some of them did not have foreign citizenship.\nAlthough COGAT told The Times of Israel that the only valid exit criteria are illness, injury, or foreign citizenship, several Gazans have traveled to Europe over the past two months without meeting these conditions. For example, 13 students left for Ireland on student visas, and several individuals traveled to France, including Gazans who had worked for French institutions in Gaza, their relatives, academics granted scholarships, and students with study visas.\nWhen The Times of Israel asked which documents were required for these exits to be approved, the embassies of Ireland and France in Israel declined to respond. However, the French embassy confirmed that it had worked for several months to secure the departure of those Gaza residents.\nAmong them were the 13 students accepted to academic institutions in Ireland, along with family members of Irish citizens. The Irish embassy in Israel declined to specify the total number of evacuees. One Irish newspaper reported that among them was a 74-year-old woman, the mother of an Irish citizen, who had waited 18 months to leave Gaza.\nPalestinians flee Beit Lahiya, in the northern Gaza Strip, March 25, 2025.

A source familiar with the matter, who spoke to The Times of Israel on condition of anonymity, said that additional Gazans had left for Canada — likely relatives of Canadian citizens — as well as for the UK. The Canadian and British embassies in Israel did not respond to inquiries regarding the exact number of people evacuated.\nExcept for one instance — a March 31 flight that took 33 German nationals and their relatives directly to Germany — all others were transferred from the Kerem Shalom crossing through Israel to Jordan by vehicle and then flown onward to Europe.\nMany of these individuals had reportedly been trying to leave Gaza for months, some since the start of the war. Following the March 31 evacuation to Germany, German officials acknowledged: “We would have preferred to do this sooner — it took us time.”\nIn total, at least 284 people are confirmed to have left Gaza for foreign destinations. The exact number is unknown, but given the significant restrictions imposed by foreign governments and Israel, it is unlikely to be much higher.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross helped coordinate the exit of these residents and foreign nationals through the Kerem Shalom crossing. It declined to tell The Times of Israel how many people it assisted over the past two months.\nPalestinians leaving Gaza arrive in the Egyptian part of the Rafah border crossing, November 12, 2023. (AFP)\nIsraeli statements contradict reality\nThe Israeli organization Gisha reported that it had recently received inquiries from 150 Gaza residents who had been accepted to study abroad but were still unable to leave the Strip. COGAT has stated that acceptance to academic programs overseas does not meet the criteria for exit.\nShai Greenberg, spokesperson for Gisha, told The Times of Israel: “Since the beginning of the war, thousands of people have been trapped in the Gaza Strip — including foreign nationals, patients in need of life-saving medical treatment unavailable in Gaza, students accepted into graduate programs abroad, and individuals eligible for family reunification in various countries.\n“This is part of a systematic violation of fundamental rights — including freedom of movement and the right to family life for both those trapped and their relatives in Gaza and abroad — as well as the rights to health, bodily integrity, education, and livelihood,” Greenberg stated.\nAhmad, who left Gaza in February after 15 months of effort, told The Times of Israel he knows many foreign nationals who remain stuck in the Strip.\n“I know a lot of people with foreign citizenship or permanent residency abroad who are still trapped in Gaza — some of them are close friends. Only one of them managed to leave, about 20 days ago,” he said.\nPalestinians in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, hold anti-war signs as a man chants slogans in support of the people of Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, who have been protesting against Hamas, March 26, 2025.

The budget will not be an obstacle — if we remove 5,000 people a day, it will take a year,” he said.\nThe data, however, appears to be in stark contrast to official Israeli rhetoric promising and encouraging the emigration of Gaza residents. Even under Israel’s strict criteria — limited to foreign nationals and those requiring urgent care — only a small number of Gazans have successfully exited the Strip."}

Also participating were representatives from Safe Reach Solutions and UG Solutions, two American companies who have been contracted to secure the humanitarian hubs being established in southern Gaza for the distribution of aid.\nAsked for comment on the matter, a State Department spokesperson did not deny that pressure is being applied to international organizations.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“While we don’t have anything to announce and wouldn’t speak on behalf of the foundation, we welcome moves to quickly get urgent food aid into Gaza in a way that prevents it from falling into the hands of terrorists.

State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce appeared to reference that announcement during a Tuesday briefing when she told reporters, “An important announcement regarding the entry of aid to Gaza will be issued in the next few days, and there is very good news.”\nTrump himself indicated Wednesday that there would be a Gaza-related announcement in the next 24 hours.\nIsrael is not waiting, though, and the IDF has already begun building the first of several humanitarian hubs in southern Gaza from which it plans to distribute aid to civilians in the coming weeks, with the Israeli official acknowledging that some Gazans “are on the brink of starvation.”\nDisplaced Palestinians walk through a makeshift tent camp in the Muwasi area of Khan Younis, in the Gaza Strip, on May 5, 2025.

The area largely constitutes the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Those entering the corridor will pass through army checkpoints in what the IDF hopes will prevent Hamas fighters from reaching the area.\nThe Israeli official said that the humanitarian zone — while making up roughly ten percent of the Strip — is large enough to house Gaza’s entire population of roughly 2 million people, though Jerusalem is also hoping some of them will be able to leave the Strip.\nThus far, however, no countries have come forward offering to take in Gazan refugees, with Israel refusing to publicly commit to allowing those who leave to return.

Five to six thousand vetted representatives will be allowed to travel by foot to the aid hubs once every two weeks in order to pick up a roughly 40-pound box of food for their families, said officials briefed on the plan.\nThe international aid group staffer said the plan does not take into account the current reality in the Strip, where hungry Gazans desperate for food are likely to flood the aid hubs once they are opened.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe staffer also took issue with the mechanism’s plan to only facilitate the entry of 60 trucks into Gaza each day from one crossing, saying the amount does not come close to what will be needed to feed the already-malnourished Gazan population.\nThe Israeli official insisted that the 60-truck figure will be sufficient to prevent starvation of Gazans."}

In all cases, residents cannot apply directly to COGAT; an international organization must submit the request on their behalf.\nIt is notable that many countries accepting patients from Gaza during the war, including the UAE and various European states, have clarified that these are temporary stays for medical treatment and that the individuals are expected to return afterward.\nRelated: Almost half of Gaza Palestinians willing to ask Israel to help them leave — poll\nSince the war began, the World Health Organization has been responsible for coordinating the evacuation of patients and their companions from the Gaza Strip.

Gazan residents cannot request exit permits from Israel directly.\nWhen the Rafah crossing was open from November 2023 to May 2024, foreign nationals used it to reach Egypt. Most were asked to pay between $2,000 and $5,000 per person to Egyptian companies managing the crossing.\nNotably, even Gazans without foreign citizenship were able to leave by paying the same amount, including senior Hamas figures such as the Hamas-run health ministry spokesperson, Ashraf al-Qudra, who reportedly exited the Strip this way during the war.\nA Palestinian stranded in Egypt waits to cross Rafah crossing to the Gaza Strip at Rafah, Egypt, after a temporary truce came into effect, November 27, 2023.

His first attempt via Rafah was denied by Israel on the grounds of “security concerns.” Later, with legal assistance from Gisha, he petitioned Israel’s High Court of Justice to leave. Israel responded after long months that it had no objection to his departure, and a week after the petition was withdrawn, his exit via Kerem Shalom crossing was coordinated.\nAhmad left Gaza after 15 months of trying, despite holding foreign citizenship and having immediate family abroad.\nIn a WhatsApp conversation with The Times of Israel, Ahmad described the experience as deeply frustrating: “Throughout the process, the official bodies responsible for handling this had failed. The citizen is the last priority.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nGazans leave following requests by foreign governments\nDespite official Israeli statements asserting that only foreign nationals or individuals in need of urgent medical care are allowed to exit Gaza, approximately 290 Gaza residents have left the Strip since the March collapse of the ceasefire. According to foreign media reports, official statements, and a source familiar with the issue who spoke with The Times of Israel, they left through foreign government intervention and not for medical reasons, and some of them did not have foreign citizenship.\nAlthough COGAT told The Times of Israel that the only valid exit criteria are illness, injury, or foreign citizenship, several Gazans have traveled to Europe over the past two months without meeting these conditions. For example, 13 students left for Ireland on student visas, and several individuals traveled to France, including Gazans who had worked for French institutions in Gaza, their relatives, academics granted scholarships, and students with study visas.\nWhen The Times of Israel asked which documents were required for these exits to be approved, the embassies of Ireland and France in Israel declined to respond. However, the French embassy confirmed that it had worked for several months to secure the departure of those Gaza residents.\nAmong them were the 13 students accepted to academic institutions in Ireland, along with family members of Irish citizens. The Irish embassy in Israel declined to specify the total number of evacuees.

The Canadian and British embassies in Israel did not respond to inquiries regarding the exact number of people evacuated.\nExcept for one instance — a March 31 flight that took 33 German nationals and their relatives directly to Germany — all others were transferred from the Kerem Shalom crossing through Israel to Jordan by vehicle and then flown onward to Europe.\nMany of these individuals had reportedly been trying to leave Gaza for months, some since the start of the war. Following the March 31 evacuation to Germany, German officials acknowledged: “We would have preferred to do this sooner — it took us time.”\nIn total, at least 284 people are confirmed to have left Gaza for foreign destinations. The exact number is unknown, but given the significant restrictions imposed by foreign governments and Israel, it is unlikely to be much higher.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross helped coordinate the exit of these residents and foreign nationals through the Kerem Shalom crossing.

COGAT has stated that acceptance to academic programs overseas does not meet the criteria for exit.\nShai Greenberg, spokesperson for Gisha, told The Times of Israel: “Since the beginning of the war, thousands of people have been trapped in the Gaza Strip — including foreign nationals, patients in need of life-saving medical treatment unavailable in Gaza, students accepted into graduate programs abroad, and individuals eligible for family reunification in various countries.\n“This is part of a systematic violation of fundamental rights — including freedom of movement and the right to family life for both those trapped and their relatives in Gaza and abroad — as well as the rights to health, bodily integrity, education, and livelihood,” Greenberg stated.\nAhmad, who left Gaza in February after 15 months of effort, told The Times of Israel he knows many foreign nationals who remain stuck in the Strip.\n“I know a lot of people with foreign citizenship or permanent residency abroad who are still trapped in Gaza — some of them are close friends. Only one of them managed to leave, about 20 days ago,” he said.\nPalestinians in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, hold anti-war signs as a man chants slogans in support of the people of Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, who have been protesting against Hamas, March 26, 2025.

The budget will not be an obstacle — if we remove 5,000 people a day, it will take a year,” he said.\nThe data, however, appears to be in stark contrast to official Israeli rhetoric promising and encouraging the emigration of Gaza residents. Even under Israel’s strict criteria — limited to foreign nationals and those requiring urgent care — only a small number of Gazans have successfully exited the Strip."}

The subcontractors will include American security firms, such as UG Solutions and Safe Reach Solutions, which helped secure the Netzarim Corridor earlier this year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe IDF will not be stationed at or near the SDSs in order to “maintain the neutral and civilian-facing nature of operations,” the memo said.\nDisplaced Palestinians cross a checkpoint manned by US and Egyptian security at the Netzarim Corridor as people make their way from the south to the north of the Gaza Strip, on Salah al-Din road, in central Gaza, on January 29, 2025.

It’s pure Jihadi gold.”\nIt’s also a convenient means of diverting public attention from the widespread poverty, hunger and corruption in Yemen. Houthi attacks are far more popular than the group itself. An October poll found that only 8% of respondents in Houthi-controlled areas viewed the group favorably, while 35% approved of the attacks.\nA malnourished Yemeni child receives treatment at a hospital in the Yemeni port city of Hodeidah on November 5, 2017.

Trump surprised Jerusalem with his announcement, and didn’t seem to care much about what it meant for Israel’s security.\nThis mirrors the nightmare scenario for Israel as Trump pursues nuclear talks with Iran.\nWith Israel on the sidelines, the president could suddenly announce a deal with Iran that leaves its nuclear program intact. Israel would find itself isolated, and unlike in the Houthi case, it would be inconceivable that it would attack Iran after an agreement with Trump.\nThe US president has talked tough on Iran. Yet his partiality toward agreements with enemies through direct talks seems to be driving policy, and Israel’s point men — Ambassador Yechiel Leiter and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer — have failed to influence policy or even keep abreast of secret talks.\nWith Trump coming to the region next week, and not planning to stop in Israel, more surprises could be in store."}

(Photo by Alex HALADA / AFP)\nIn January, it said it would enrich uranium — a process that can also be used as part of a military program — to create ‘yellowcake’ fuel for nuclear power generation that it could sell.\nAny deal with Washington would likely address safeguards to assuage worries about military ambitions, on top of Saudi Arabia’s existing commitment not to pursue a bomb under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhat’s in it for the United States?\nThere could be strategic and commercial gains.\nCivil nuclear cooperation was an important inducement along with security guarantees in an effort by Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden to broker a deal for Saudi Arabia and Israel to normalize relations.\nHowever, those two issues are now uncoupled, Reuters has reported, though a nuclear deal could be a sweetener in US diplomatic efforts with the kingdom. Riyadh has ruled out normalizing ties with Israel without Palestinian statehood.\nUS Energy Secretary Chris Wright met Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman in April and said the two countries were on “a pathway” to a civil nuclear agreement. He made no mention of a wider deal over other issues such as normalization.\nUS President Donald Trump, left, and Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud gesture during a signing ceremony at the Saudi Royal Court in Riyadh on May 20, 2017. (AFP Photo/Mandel Ngan)\nA deal would put US industry in a prime spot to win contracts to build Saudi nuclear power plants as well as providing insight into the kingdom’s atomic program that could alleviate any US worries over weapons proliferation.\nUnder Section 123 of the US Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the US may negotiate agreements to engage in significant civil nuclear cooperation with other nations.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe act specifies nine nonproliferation criteria that states must meet to keep them from using the technology to develop nuclear arms or transfer sensitive materials to others.\nUS law stipulates congressional review of such pacts.\nSaudi Arabia has options\nShould the US-Saudi talks fail, several countries with established nuclear industries have expressed interest or are seen as potential partners for Saudi Arabia’s nuclear program.\nIllustrative: Staff members from the China National Nuclear Corporation attend foreign visitors at the display booth of China’s state-owned CNNC during the China International Exhibition on Nuclear Power Industry in Beijing, Thursday, April 27, 2017. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)\nState-owned China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC) reportedly submitted a bid in 2023 to construct a nuclear plant. Russia’s state nuclear firm Rosatom, which built a nuclear plant in Egypt, has also signed preliminary cooperation agreements with Riyadh. Other potential contenders include South Korea, which built reactors in the neighboring United Arab Emirates, and France.\nThe choice of partner will likely depend on technological offerings, financing, and geopolitical alignment, including conditions related to nuclear fuel handling.\nUranium enrichment\nA key issue is whether Washington might agree to build a uranium enrichment facility on Saudi territory, when it might do so, and whether Saudi personnel might have access to it or it would be run solely by US staff in a “black box” arrangement.\nWithout rigorous safeguards built into an agreement, Saudi Arabia, which has uranium ore reserves on its territory, could theoretically use an enrichment facility to produce highly enriched uranium, which, if purified enough, can yield fissile material for bombs.\nAnother issue is whether Riyadh would agree to make a Saudi investment in a US-based and US-owned uranium enrichment plant and to hire US companies to build Saudi nuclear reactors.\nThere are diplomatic issues too: Washington’s top regional ally Israel has repeatedly voiced opposition to the idea of a Saudi civil nuclear program."}

To receive these Editor’s Notes as they’re released, join the ToI Community here.\nOn his first trip to our immediate neighborhood as US president, in June 2009, Barack Obama flew to Cairo and delivered an outreach speech to the Muslim world in which he related to Israel largely in the context of the Holocaust and made no mention of sovereign Jewish history in the Holy Land. He flew home without so much as a stopover in Israel, the United States’ one and only democratic, ultra-dependable ally in this part of the world.\nBy contrast, Donald Trump, in his first visit anywhere overseas as president, spent two days in Israel in May 2017, stood with his head bowed at the Western Wall and highlighted what he said was his “privilege” to address the people of Israel in the ancient city of Jerusalem. “I make this promise to you,” he declared in the final public event of his visit, at the Israel Museum, “my administration will always stand with Israel.”\n00:00 / 23:33\n“Iran’s leaders routinely call for Israel’s destruction,” Trump noted bitterly in that same speech, and then departed from the prepared text on the teleprompters to vow: “Not with Donald J Trump, believe me!” His audience, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, stood and cheered. “Thank you,” he said three times, as the applause went on and on.

The “very, very big announcement” he is teasing ahead of his departure could remake any understanding of what he is planning and doing in this region. But for Israel, from a president with a proven first-term record of dramatic pro-Israel action — recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the US embassy here, brokering the Abraham Accords, and withdrawing from the Obama-led, terribly flawed 2015 JCPOA agreement on Iran’s nuclear program — the words and deeds in these first 100-plus days are increasingly worrying.\nWithout informing Israel in advance, he opened direct talks with Hamas, via an emissary, Adam Boehler, who plainly did not recognize Hamas’s eliminate-Israel raison d’être, overseen by his most important foreign policy envoy, Steve Witkoff, who also thinks Hamas is not “ideologically intractable.”\nSpringing the news on Netanyahu just before telling the rest of the world, with a helpless prime minister at his side in the Oval Office, he initiated talks with Iran, again with Witkoff in the leading role. And he and his key officials have spent the past month flipping back and forth on whether a deal that he says “is going to happen” will require the cessation of all Iranian uranium enrichment… or not, and will entail the dismantling of all Iran’s nuclear facilities… or not. Meaning, it will actually prevent a regime dead-set on attaining a nuclear weapons arsenal from achieving that goal, with Israel its prime target… or not.\nADVERTISEMENT\nApparently without significant consultation with Netanyahu, he had previously unveiled a bizarre vision for taking over and leveling Gaza, and turning it into a Middle East real estate “riviera” development project, shifting characteristically again on whether this would involve the forced expulsion of all Gazans, and offering no credible mechanism for distinguishing between the “wonderful” non-Hamas Gazans he would rehouse who-knows-where and the inhumane Hamas Gazans who would need to be eliminated.\nSmoke in the area of Ben Gurion Airport after a ballistic missile was fired at Israel from Yemen on May 4, 2025 (Screen grab from social media used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)\nAnd then on Tuesday, two days after Yemen’s Houthi terror group breached Israel’s usually effective air defenses and fired a ballistic missile into the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport, a few hundred yards from the main control tower — prompting almost every international airline to cancel their flights to and from our beleaguered little country — he announced that he had reached an agreement with the Houthis under which the US would no longer be targeting their assets.\nAstonishingly, again, he did not forewarn Israel — a country whose own airlines are now its only dependable connection to the rest of the world, as a direct consequence of the malevolent activities of a terror group he has now let off the hook. If the president made an effort to require that the Houthis stop targeting Israel as part of his deal with them, he evidently did not insist upon it, since the Houthis followed his latest bombshell-for-Israel announcement by stating that they would indeed continue to attack us and, indeed, fired a drone in our direction on Wednesday morning.\nWere it not for that dramatically Israel-supportive first term — not just rhetoric, but demonstrative, incredibly far-reaching action — you might be forgiven for wondering whether Trump had taken office at strategic odds with Israel, or at least fairly indifferent to Israel, perhaps in the grip of the personal anti-Netanyahu animus that was so evident when he declared “Fuck him,” in comments published in January 2021, because the prime minister had ostensibly been too quick to congratulate Joe Biden on winning the 2020 presidential elections.\nTrump came into office, this time around, promising to stop wars and to put America first. The first of those goals, if achievable, is entirely laudable and hugely beneficial to humankind. And every nation’s leader has a primary obligation to look first to his or her country’s interests. But you cannot partially stop wars, or cut deals with enemy nations, solely on the basis of your country’s self-interest, least of all when you’re the head of a global superpower and your presidential role includes leadership of the free world. That would constitute the abandonment of your allies and only a fleeting victory for America’s own interests, since the genocidal enemies the free world is facing cannot be subdued by — indeed are empowered by — short-term and inadequate agreements.\nAs things stand, Israel has widening cause for concern from a US president that our leadership and a sizable majority of the nation were confident would put Israel’s wellbeing high on his global agenda. That “very, very big announcement” better be a real zinger.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signs a guest book at the White House as US President Donald Trump looks on in Washington DC, April 7, 2025 (Avi Ohayon/GPO)\nGoing up in flames\nWith the US led by an unpredictable leader, the need for Israel to come together in its own defense has never been greater.\nIsrael has always championed its capacity to defend itself, by itself, but has also depended on core external allies for military, diplomatic and all manner of other practical and psychological support. Since October 7, with the despicable rush to blame the victim — Israel, as it has struggled to defang Gaza’s entrenched, cynical, Hamas government and to secure the release of our hostages — that international support has been in perhaps unprecedentedly steep decline.\nYet Netanyahu continues to whip up internal divides, by decrying all political and public opponents as tools of our enemies, hacking away at all independent state institutions, discrediting the judiciary, and upholding the ultra-Orthodox community’s refusal to serve even as the burden on our reserves forces weighs ever more heavily.\nIDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir (center) is seen in Gaza City’s Shejaiya neighborhood, April 15, 2025. (Israel Defense Forces)\nNow he is about to embark on a vastly expanded military operation in Gaza — which risks endangering the hostages, will see more soldiers killed, will kill more Gazans, but which Netanyahu insists will succeed where 18 months of warfare have failed in achieving “total victory.” He claims the latest war plan was produced and recommended by the IDF’s chief of staff.\nYet his far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, on whose support he depends, enthused this week that this operation will eventuate not in the replacement of Hamas by reliable local, regional and/or international governance, but in the “total destruction” of Gaza, the confining of its population to a narrow border area, and the permanent reoccupation of the Strip by Israel and Israeli forces, which is certainly not the IDF’s declared goal.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) in a video with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich after passing the 2025 state budget, March 25, 2025.

Parts of the country were actually going up in flames as we tried to celebrate independence, with the TV broadcasts flipping from prerecorded celebrations to real-time wildfires, with the heroic fire and rescue services — overseen by ministerial pyromaniac Itamar Ben Gvir, and rendered strategically under-resourced by our dysfunctional government — desperately trying to gain control over the blazes, even as Netanyahu inaccurately blamed Arab arsonists and his vicious son pointed a finger at “the left.”\nA fire is seen raging near decommissioned tanks at Yad Lashiryon, the Armored Corps Memorial Site and Museum, next to Latrun outside Jerusalem, April 30, 2025.

Perhaps he’s playing a game so clever that, when all is revealed, Iran, the Houthis, Hamas et al will find themselves outmaneuvered and helpless, and we’ll see Trump’s promised new Abraham Accords allies partnering with Israel, and our nation vastly more secure.\nEvidently, Israel’s leaders are having trouble exerting much influence. So we can only hope.\n“The ties of the Jewish people to this Holy Land are ancient and eternal. They date back thousands of years, including the reign of King David, whose star now flies proudly on Israel’s white and blue flag.” So said Donald Trump, first-term president of the United States, in Jerusalem on May 23, 2017 — doing what his predecessor had failed to in stressing our connection to this land, on an early visit to Israel that his predecessor had chosen not to make.\n“But a hopeful future for children in the Middle East requires the world to fully recognize the vital role of the state of Israel,” Trump went on. “And, on behalf of the United States, we pledge to stand by you and defend our shared values so that together we can defeat terrorism and create safety for all of God’s children.”\nAmen to that."}

(Kerolos Salah/AFP)\nDespite reports of increased movement through the Kerem Shalom crossing, according to a source familiar with the issue who talked to The Times of Israel, and public announcements by foreign countries and humanitarian organizations, only about 600 people have left the Gaza Strip in the past two months, since the collapse of the most recent ceasefire.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis is a relatively small number compared to the exodus earlier in the conflict.\nFor comparison, according to Egyptian media reports, around 103,000 people exited Gaza through the Rafah crossing between November 2023 and May 2024. Additionally, during the second ceasefire between February 1 and March 17 of this year, 4,259 Gazans — including patients, wounded individuals, and their family members — were evacuated from the Strip for medical treatment abroad.\nLeaving Gaza requires international intervention\nIsrael’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the body under the Defense Ministry responsible for coordinating the movement of Gaza residents, has maintained that the only criteria for exiting Gaza — both before and throughout the war — are severe illness or injury, or foreign citizenship. In all cases, residents cannot apply directly to COGAT; an international organization must submit the request on their behalf.\nIt is notable that many countries accepting patients from Gaza during the war, including the UAE and various European states, have clarified that these are temporary stays for medical treatment and that the individuals are expected to return afterward.\nRelated: Almost half of Gaza Palestinians willing to ask Israel to help them leave — poll\nSince the war began, the World Health Organization has been responsible for coordinating the evacuation of patients and their companions from the Gaza Strip.

Following the Israeli ground operation in Rafah on May 6, 2024, the crossing was closed.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn June 2024, Israel began allowing patients to exit Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Israel and then into Jordan by vehicle via the Allenby Bridge.

Since last February, some Gazan patients have been allowed to fly directly from Israel via Ramon Airport in the Negev in the south of Israel. (Until then, Ramon Airport in southern Israel was not used for international flights.)\nThe WHO publishes an online chart that is updated every few weeks to show the number of individuals evacuated from Gaza. According to the data, from the collapse of the ceasefire on March 18 until May 6, a total of 310 people — patients and companions — were evacuated.\nForeign nationals still waiting to exit\nTo exit Gaza as a foreign citizen — including dual citizens —  during the war, the individual’s country must submit a formal request to COGAT and provide proof of citizenship and presence in Gaza. Gazan residents cannot request exit permits from Israel directly.\nWhen the Rafah crossing was open from November 2023 to May 2024, foreign nationals used it to reach Egypt. Most were asked to pay between $2,000 and $5,000 per person to Egyptian companies managing the crossing.\nNotably, even Gazans without foreign citizenship were able to leave by paying the same amount, including senior Hamas figures such as the Hamas-run health ministry spokesperson, Ashraf al-Qudra, who reportedly exited the Strip this way during the war.\nA Palestinian stranded in Egypt waits to cross Rafah crossing to the Gaza Strip at Rafah, Egypt, after a temporary truce came into effect, November 27, 2023.

His wife and two daughters live in Europe, where he has resided for the past decade. He requested that his full name and identifying details not be published.\nIn September 2023, Ahmad traveled to Gaza for a family visit. Once the war broke out, he attempted to leave and return home. His first attempt via Rafah was denied by Israel on the grounds of “security concerns.” Later, with legal assistance from Gisha, he petitioned Israel’s High Court of Justice to leave. Israel responded after long months that it had no objection to his departure, and a week after the petition was withdrawn, his exit via Kerem Shalom crossing was coordinated.\nAhmad left Gaza after 15 months of trying, despite holding foreign citizenship and having immediate family abroad.\nIn a WhatsApp conversation with The Times of Israel, Ahmad described the experience as deeply frustrating: “Throughout the process, the official bodies responsible for handling this had failed. The citizen is the last priority.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nGazans leave following requests by foreign governments\nDespite official Israeli statements asserting that only foreign nationals or individuals in need of urgent medical care are allowed to exit Gaza, approximately 290 Gaza residents have left the Strip since the March collapse of the ceasefire. According to foreign media reports, official statements, and a source familiar with the issue who spoke with The Times of Israel, they left through foreign government intervention and not for medical reasons, and some of them did not have foreign citizenship.\nAlthough COGAT told The Times of Israel that the only valid exit criteria are illness, injury, or foreign citizenship, several Gazans have traveled to Europe over the past two months without meeting these conditions. For example, 13 students left for Ireland on student visas, and several individuals traveled to France, including Gazans who had worked for French institutions in Gaza, their relatives, academics granted scholarships, and students with study visas.\nWhen The Times of Israel asked which documents were required for these exits to be approved, the embassies of Ireland and France in Israel declined to respond. However, the French embassy confirmed that it had worked for several months to secure the departure of those Gaza residents.\nAmong them were the 13 students accepted to academic institutions in Ireland, along with family members of Irish citizens. The Irish embassy in Israel declined to specify the total number of evacuees. One Irish newspaper reported that among them was a 74-year-old woman, the mother of an Irish citizen, who had waited 18 months to leave Gaza.\nPalestinians flee Beit Lahiya, in the northern Gaza Strip, March 25, 2025.

A source familiar with the matter, who spoke to The Times of Israel on condition of anonymity, said that additional Gazans had left for Canada — likely relatives of Canadian citizens — as well as for the UK. The Canadian and British embassies in Israel did not respond to inquiries regarding the exact number of people evacuated.\nExcept for one instance — a March 31 flight that took 33 German nationals and their relatives directly to Germany — all others were transferred from the Kerem Shalom crossing through Israel to Jordan by vehicle and then flown onward to Europe.\nMany of these individuals had reportedly been trying to leave Gaza for months, some since the start of the war. Following the March 31 evacuation to Germany, German officials acknowledged: “We would have preferred to do this sooner — it took us time.”\nIn total, at least 284 people are confirmed to have left Gaza for foreign destinations. The exact number is unknown, but given the significant restrictions imposed by foreign governments and Israel, it is unlikely to be much higher.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross helped coordinate the exit of these residents and foreign nationals through the Kerem Shalom crossing. It declined to tell The Times of Israel how many people it assisted over the past two months.\nPalestinians leaving Gaza arrive in the Egyptian part of the Rafah border crossing, November 12, 2023. (AFP)\nIsraeli statements contradict reality\nThe Israeli organization Gisha reported that it had recently received inquiries from 150 Gaza residents who had been accepted to study abroad but were still unable to leave the Strip. COGAT has stated that acceptance to academic programs overseas does not meet the criteria for exit.\nShai Greenberg, spokesperson for Gisha, told The Times of Israel: “Since the beginning of the war, thousands of people have been trapped in the Gaza Strip — including foreign nationals, patients in need of life-saving medical treatment unavailable in Gaza, students accepted into graduate programs abroad, and individuals eligible for family reunification in various countries.\n“This is part of a systematic violation of fundamental rights — including freedom of movement and the right to family life for both those trapped and their relatives in Gaza and abroad — as well as the rights to health, bodily integrity, education, and livelihood,” Greenberg stated.\nAhmad, who left Gaza in February after 15 months of effort, told The Times of Israel he knows many foreign nationals who remain stuck in the Strip.\n“I know a lot of people with foreign citizenship or permanent residency abroad who are still trapped in Gaza — some of them are close friends. Only one of them managed to leave, about 20 days ago,” he said.\nPalestinians in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, hold anti-war signs as a man chants slogans in support of the people of Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, who have been protesting against Hamas, March 26, 2025.

The budget will not be an obstacle — if we remove 5,000 people a day, it will take a year,” he said.\nThe data, however, appears to be in stark contrast to official Israeli rhetoric promising and encouraging the emigration of Gaza residents. Even under Israel’s strict criteria — limited to foreign nationals and those requiring urgent care — only a small number of Gazans have successfully exited the Strip."}

{"title": "Chair of UK Oct. 7 report: ‘Denial started while the massacres were still ongoing’", "date": "9 May 2025, 9:31 am", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/chair-of-uk-oct-7-report-denial-started-while-the-massacres-were-still-ongoing/", "type": "article", "content": "LONDON — With its minute-by-minute timeline, copious testimony from survivors and eyewitnesses, and wealth of forensic evidence and open-source footage, the 316-page report produced by British parliamentarians last month detailing the terrible events of October 7, 2023, is a comprehensive and meticulous account of the Hamas onslaught on Israel.\nThat is unsurprising. The panel responsible for the “7 October Parliamentary Commission Report” was chaired by Andrew Roberts, a renowned historian, biographer and expert on warfare, from the Battle of Waterloo to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\nIt isn’t simply Roberts’s longstanding support for Israel that led him to agree to chair the commission, but his concern over continuing attempts to whitewash Hamas’s atrocities — an effort he compares to Holocaust denial.\n“There’s a movement afoot on behalf of Hamas and its sympathizers to pretend that October 7 never happened,” he tells The Times of Israel. The report’s aim was to compile “a large amount of unimpeachable evidence to prove that it did.”\nWith an eye on history, Roberts also wanted to gather irrefutable proof to ensure that, in future decades, “the deniers” can still be challenged, even in the absence of living eyewitnesses.\nRoberts, who is not Jewish, does not underestimate the scale of the challenge.\n“It took decades for Holocaust denial to really get going,” he says, “but October 7 denial started while the actual massacres were still going [on].”\nHe recognizes that Hamas’s denial of its crimes contains multiple grim ironies. Pointing to the GoPro cameras worn by the terrorists as they perpetrated murder, torture and rape, he notes the group and its allies are “attempting to deny something that they themselves have provided the best evidence for.”\nRoberts also believes that Hamas is trying to “have their cake and eat it.”\n“They are trying to celebrate something they deny happened, and deny something that they’ve celebrated happening,” he says. “It’s unlike anything else, really. Speaking as a historian, you’ve got to come down on one side or the other about an occasion [or] a big historical event like October 7, and you’ve got to say that either it happened, and it was terrible, or that it didn’t happen.”\n“You can’t have it both ways, and yet that’s what Hamas and its supporters in the West are trying to get,” he adds.\nDepravity of human nature, filmed in real-time\nRoberts, who sits as a Conservative member of the House of Lords, and fellow members of the panel — who include Labour and Liberal Democrat parliamentarians and a former UK chief prosecutor — visited Israel and the scenes of some of the October 7 attacks. Roberts says it was both the “breadth as well as the depth” of the assault that struck him — not just the murder of some 1,200 people and abduction of 251, but the “depravity of human nature that was seen, the sheer cruelty, the sexual violence and the humiliation.”\nRoberts speaks of the “bloodlust” displayed by the assailants — they killed a 10-month-old baby and a Holocaust survivor in his 90s — as well as the “premeditation of the cruelty.”\nBlood is seen splattered in a child’s room following a massive Hamas terror onslaught on October 7, 2023, in Kibbutz Nir Oz, October 19, 2023 (AP/Francisco Seco)\nHistorically, he says, this is unusual. “Bloodlust happens a lot in history, but it’s very rare that it’s been set up so diligently and with such foresight — ‘malice aforethought’ as it used to be called,” he says.\nThe report of the 7 October Parliamentary commission, which was established by the All Party UK-Israel Parliamentary Group, isn’t an official publication of the House of Commons or the House of Lords. Roberts accepts that it has already been written off by some on social media as “Zionist propaganda” — the internet, he jokes, has become “the universal lavatory wall” — but he believes it cannot easily be “intellectually and rationally written off.”\n“Bloodlust happens a lot in history, but it’s very rare that it’s been set up so diligently and with such foresight — ‘malice aforethought’ as it used to be called”\nThe panel was careful to stick to verifiable facts, avoid speculation and focus simply on the events of October 7, he says.\n“We were not attempting to do what other reports could do better, which is to look into the intelligence failures and everything else that happened in the background to it,” Roberts says.\nThe report argues that Hamas knew that “military victory was unlikely” and instead sought to trigger an Israeli retaliation, which would isolate the country internationally and spark global outrage. However, Roberts disputes the notion that, on these terms, Hamas has already emerged victorious.\nIsraeli soldiers at the forensic center in the Shura military base near Ramle, where hundreds of bodies arrived after the October 7 Hamas onslaught, October 24, 2023. (Yossi Aloni/Flash90)\n“In terms of the propaganda war, I think they have won in that on these disgusting, ridiculous social media sites, like TikTok and Instagram, you’re getting… 10 times more anti-Israel propaganda than pro-Israeli facts and truth,” he acknowledges.\nBut, he continues, the war itself is not over and it won’t be possible to say either side has won until both sides have stopped fighting — a prospect that seems some way off. Indeed, quoting Winston Churchill’s famous words upon becoming UK prime minister in 1940, Roberts believes that Israel will eventually prevail, but it will take “a lot more blood, toil, tears and sweat.”\nCheckered history of surprise attacks\nRoberts’s belief that Hamas can be vanquished rests in part on the checkered history of surprise attacks. They may give the attacker a momentary advantage, but, with a “very few” exceptions — such as the 1967 Six Day War, when Israel launched a preemptive strike — they rarely lead to ultimate success. The Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Yom Kippur assault on Israel in October 1973, Argentina’s invasion of the Falkland Islands in April 1982, and Saddam Hussein’s grab for Kuwait in August 1990 did not see the aggressor triumph.\nWhile undertaking a surprise attack “seems like a good idea at the time… ultimately, it leads to a much worse situation for the people who launch [it],” believes Roberts. “If you launch a barbarous and vicious surprise attack, you shouldn’t be surprised about the response,” the historian says, noting the “holy rage and fury” that is stirred on the part of those who have been attacked.\n“If you launch a barbarous and vicious surprise attack, you shouldn’t be surprised about the response”\nThe author of an acclaimed biography of Churchill, Roberts has previously compared Israel’s position to that of Britain in 1940.\n“In that 12-month period from June 1940 to June 1941, Britain and her Commonwealth formed the tip of the spear against ‘the menace of tyranny,’ just as brave Israel today represents the tip of civilization’s spear against the tyranny and barbarism of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism and exterminationism,” he wrote in the Jewish Chronicle last October.\nRoberts readily admits, however, that Britain, which had not yet been joined by the US and Russia but had strong backing from the Empire and Commonwealth, was less alone than Israel is today. With the exception of the US, he says, “it’s difficult to look around the world and see countries that are really four-square behind Israel in what is essentially a struggle between civilization and barbarism.”\nHe worries that people in the West “enjoy attacking ourselves… and berating ourselves” for “perfectly reasonable” responses to surprise attacks such as 9/11 or October 7. He contrasts the response to Pearl Harbor.\nA handout photograph released by the UK Parliament shows Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, making a statement on the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 and the situation in the Middle East, in the House of Commons in London on October 7, 2024 (JESSICA TAYLOR / UK PARLIAMENT / AFP)\n“Nobody attacked FDR [who was US president at the outbreak of World War II], or, indeed at the time, [US] president Truman [under whose administration a nuclear bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki], for punishing the attack on Pearl Harbor as condignly as they did, whereas today, everybody seems to be leaping up and down, criticizing the West for punishing these equally horrific attacks,” Roberts says.\nNonetheless, Roberts is convinced that Churchill would have recognized and sympathized with Israel’s position today.\n“He was a Zionist. He didn’t subscribe to [the] antisemitism that so many of the people of his age, class and background did. He was a supporter of the Balfour Declaration and believed that the ‘Judeo’ side of Judeo-Christian civilization… gave Christianity its ethics and its positive moral angle,” he says.\nRoberts says that Churchill’s daughter had once warned him never to assume what the former prime minister would have said about any event after his death in 1965, but he is happy to wager an opinion.\n“It strikes me as very clear that he would have been as outraged as any other decent, rational, logical human being about what had happened on October 7, and he would certainly have been in favor of a terrible punishment raining down on Hamas,” Roberts says. “He was a humanitarian and so he’d have wanted to have minimized the civilian casualties in Gaza, and I believe that the IDF have done that to the best of their ability.”\nPerhaps, like Roberts, Churchill would also have seen a commonality between the enemy he defeated and that which Israel faces.\n“The overlap between Hamas ideology and Nazi ideology is so well colored in on the Venn diagram”\n“The overlap between Hamas ideology and Nazi ideology is so well colored in on the Venn diagram,” Roberts says.\nOf course, he adds, it is always “difficult and dangerous” to draw direct historical analogies. Hamas’s murderous rampage cannot be compared with the industrial-scale killing carried out by the Nazis, even if the former wore GoPro cameras and broadcast their “monstrous actions” on Facebook while the latter tried to cover up their crimes and destroy the gas chambers in 1945.\n“The analogy between Hamas and the Nazis strikes me as completely obvious one,” Roberts says. “I think you’d have to be deliberately obtuse not to see the connections.”\nThe Hamas attacks of October 7 and the ensuing conflict have confirmed Roberts’s belief that launching a war is a “profoundly immoral” act.\n“Wars are truly terrible things, which is why you shouldn’t start them,” he says, “and why you should fight them in as humanitarian a way as you can, which I think is what Israel has done.”"}

Essentially, the report said, they view Chikli as the person who “ran” the Shin Bet agent.\nAs such, they believe he should be questioned in the case against Aleph, it said.\nChikli, on Thursday, wrote to Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, who must approve requests to investigate cabinet ministers, to tell her he had become aware of DIPI’s request on Wednesday when a journalist asked him for a response to the development.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nIn the letter, the minister alleged that Baharav-Miara has a multitude of conflicts of interest and therefore should not make the call on whether or not he should be questioned under caution.\nAleph, a 25-year veteran of the domestic security service, is suspected of exposing information about a probe into the alleged spread of Kahanism in the police force, which comes under the purview of far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir.

If the experiment is successful, they would be the first non-state actor to do so.\n“This is no longer a small group manufacturing underdeveloped weapons,” Lons said, underlining the increased “complexity of what the Houthis are capable of producing by themselves.”"}

That act raised eyebrows at the Vatican and was denounced by former Italian premier Romano Prodi as indecent political interference in matters of faith.\nAnd last month, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops announced the end of a half-century of partnerships with the federal US government to serve refugees and migrant children, saying the “heartbreaking” decision followed the Trump administration’s abrupt halt to funding.\nThe majority of Leo’s posts on the X platform are related to or in support of Catholic news and church initiatives.

May God bless him!”\nADVERTISEMENT\nPope Leo is expected to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Pope Francis, a champion of the poor and of immigrants, who also had his differences with the Trump administration.

Is your conscience not disturbed? How can you stay quiet?”\nLeo’s critiques of Trump date back nearly a decade.\nWhen Trump’s first presidential campaign ramped up in July 2015, he posted to X a Washington Post op-ed by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, with the headline, “Why Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric is so problematic.”\nIn the wake of Trump’s first election in 2016, Leo reposted a homily in which Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez — characterizing the fear among many, including schoolchildren who “think the government is going to come and deport their parents, any day now” — said that America is “better than this.”\nDays later, Leo also posted an article by a Catholic outlet quoting Democrats as saying that, in her loss, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton “ignored pro-lifers at her own peril.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nPope Francis elevates to cardinal the US prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops Robert Francis Prevost during a consistory to create 21 new cardinals at St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican on September 30, 2023.

John T. Pawlikowski, who taught for nearly half a century at the Catholic Theological Union until his retirement in 2017, served as co-founder and director of the school’s Catholic-Jewish Studies Program and also served four terms on the board of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.\nMore than 40 years after Leo’s ordination as a priest, Pawlikowski remembers the new pope as a good student with an open mind.\n“I do remember him as a pretty bright student,” Pawlikowski said in an interview shortly after his former student was introduced to the world as the sitting bishop of Rome.\nPawlikowski added later, “My experience of him was he’s a very open-minded person who’s very much in the context of Vatican II.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nVatican II, or the Second Vatican Council, inaugurated a new era in Jewish-Catholic relations in 1965 when it issued a document, Nostra Aetate, repudiating antisemitism and stating that the Jewish people were not responsible for Jesus’ death. Ties between the two religious communities were blossoming at the time when Leo was studying for the priesthood in the late 1970s and early ‘80s.\nUnder Pawlikowski, Leo studied Catholic social teaching, which focuses on social and economic issues. Pawlikowski says relations with Jews are relevant to that field. CTU has also had a commitment to Catholic-Jewish relations since its founding and launched its formal program in the field in 1968.\nPeople hold up a US flag as the newly elected Pope Leo XIV appears at the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican, May 8, 2025. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\n“I’ve always argued that antisemitism is something that has to be counted as part of the Catholic commitment to social justice and human dignity,” he said. “My work on Catholic social teaching did include always the issue of antisemitism.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe pope spent much of his career in Peru and is thought of as a relative centrist and Vatican insider. He hasn’t been a prominent figure in Jewish-Catholic dialogue or fighting antisemitism, and doesn’t appear to have commented publicly on Israel or the war in Gaza, sparked by the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, assault. Pope Francis, his predecessor, did opine on those issues and had relations with Jewish leaders in his native Argentina.\nBut Leo’s coming of age in the era of Vatican II — plus his roots in Chicago, which has a large Jewish community, also leads Rabbi Noam Marans, the American Jewish Committee’s director of interreligious and intergroup relations, to feel optimistic.\n“He studied at CTU under John Pawlikowski and in the post-Nostra Aetate era, in the country where Catholic-Jewish relations are preeminent,” Marans said in an interview. “An American pope bodes well for the future of Catholic-Jewish relations. More than anywhere in the world, the relationship between Catholics and Jews has flourished and set a gold standard in the United States.”\nWhile Francis was outspoken in his opposition to antisemitism and his promotion of ties with Jews, he raised the ire of some Jewish leaders in recent years for his criticism of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. One of his last acts as pope was to donate his popemobile to Gaza as a mobile medical unit.\nPope Francis flanked by Rabbi Riccardo Di Segni, right, during his visit to the Great Synagogue of Rome, Sunday, Jan. 17, 2016.

Pawlikowski said it’s too soon to tell, given that Leo has not thus far focused on the issue.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“He hasn’t really been stationed in any area where there was a really pronounced Jewish community,” he said. “On the question of interreligious [affairs], he’ll have to show us where he is, but I would assume he had an outgoing, positive attitude generally.”\nIn his first address as pope, Leo issued a call to dialogue.\n“Help us as well — help one another — to build bridges through dialogue, through encounter, uniting everyone to be one single people always in peace,” he said.\nRabbi Joshua Stanton, associate vice president for interfaith and intergroup initiatives at the Jewish Federations of North America, saw that as a sign that the pope is committed to Catholic-Jewish relations. He noted that this year is Nostra Aetate’s 60th anniversary, which he hopes Leo commemorates in an active way.\n“I’m very hopeful that he referenced the importance of dialogue and reaching out beyond the Catholic Church to other religious communities,” Stanton said. Stanton noted that Leo has a reputation for “quiet efficacy,” and as he settles into his position, Stanton said he’ll be looking at how the pontiff acts.\n“Does he invite Jewish leaders to the Vatican to meet with him?” he said. “Does he invite leaders from other traditions? Does he try to bring multiple groups together at the same time?”\nThe focus of Leo’s address on Thursday was peace. With war raging in Gaza, Marans did not take that as a specific reference to the Middle East.\n“All popes want peace,” he said. “May I add, all Catholics, Jews, rabbis want peace.”"}

All three were taken from the Nova music festival in southern Israel during Hamas’s October 2023 invasion of Israel.\nThey were held in Gaza by Abdallah Aljamal, according to the lawsuit and the IDF. Aljamal was a writer for the Palestine Chronicle, a news outlet run by the People Media Project, a US-based, tax-exempt nonprofit that is the focus of the lawsuit.\nThe hostages were rescued after 246 days in captivity in an IDF operation in June that also extracted hostage Noa Argamani, who was held separately nearby. Aljamal, his wife Fatima and his father Ahmad Aljamal were all killed during the hostage rescue mission. The family’s children survived.\nThe lawsuit argues that the Palestine Chronicle provided Aljamal with a platform to “disseminate Hamas propaganda,” providing material support to a US-designated terrorist organization, in violation of international law.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe defendants filed to dismiss the case in March. Tuesday’s letter was a response to that motion.\nUS District Judge Tiffany Cartwright said the hostages had “stated a plausible claim that [the Palestine Chronicle] aided and abetted their kidnapping and Hamas’s acts of terrorism.”\nCartwright added that the Palestine Chronicle’s claims that it was ignorant of Aljamal’s terror ties were “unpersuasive.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraeli hostages pictured after their rescue from Hamas captivity in Gaza on June 8, 2024. From left: Shlomi Ziv (IDF); Andrey Kozlov and Almog Meir Jan (Avshalom Sassoni/Flash90); and Noa Argamani (Courtesy).\nAljamal’s direct communications with the defendants, his public appearances as a Hamas spokesperson, and his social media support for Hamas “support a reasonable inference that [the Palestine Chronicle] knew Aljamal was affiliated with Hamas and involved in the October 7 attack,” the judge said.\nShe added that the close relationship between the Palestine Chronicle and Aljamal, and the timing of their coordination on work activities, were reasons to believe that the nonprofit’s payments to Aljaamal assisted him in holding the hostages.\nThe court denied the Palestine Chronicle’s motion to dismiss and an attempt to prevent the case from entering the discovery phase.\nThe lawsuit, backed by the National Jewish Advocacy Center, was filed in a federal court in Washington State, where the People Media Project is based.\nThe lawsuit has also revealed that Aljamal told the hostages that “Hamas was in contact and actively coordinating with its affiliates in the media and on college campuses,” according to an amended complaint filed in February that was first reported by The Times of Israel.\nAljamal told the hostages that “Hamas was going to ensure that the United States, as well as Jews and Israelis, are hated everywhere and that Hamas in Gaza was coordinating with its allies, including its allies in the media and on college campuses, to foment hatred against Israel and Jews,” the complaint said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnti-Israel activists protest outside Columbia University, January 21, 2025. (Luke Tress/Times of Israel)\nThe Palestine Chronicle was reporting about US campus protests around the same time, and in August 2024, published an article about Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal urging university students to protest.\nAljamal was previously a spokesperson for the Hamas-run labor ministry in Gaza. He was open about his affiliation with the terror group, appearing publicly in Arabic media as a spokesperson and posting Hamas graphics and photos of his son wearing a Hamas headband on social media. He began writing for the Palestine Chronicle in 2019 while still serving as a spokesperson for Hamas’s labor ministry, according to the lawsuit.\nAljamal appears to have had foreknowledge of the Hamas attack. On October 7, at 5:43 a.m., immediately before the invasion, he posted a message on TikTok that said, “O God, guide us.. O God, grant us the victory that you promised.. O God, acceptance, acceptance, acceptance.. Your victory, O God,” followed by a heart emoji.\nLater in the day, Aljamal praised the attack on Facebook.\nHe began writing for the Palestine Chronicle more frequently after the attack, sometimes publishing multiple articles per day, while he was holding the Israelis hostage and communicating with the outlet’s staff in the US.\nImmediately after the hostage rescue, the Palestine Chronicle changed Aljamal’s description on its website from “correspondent” to “contributor,” then later described him as a “freelance contributor” writing on “a voluntary basis.” It also eulogized him in an article after his death, calling him a “well-known journalist murdered in Gaza,” and denied that he had been holding the hostages.\nThe hostages were aware that Aljamal was communicating with terror groups, recording footage and writing about their own captivity, the complaint said. All three were “terrorized” during their captivity, subjected to arbitrary punishment, physical threats, and physical and psychological abuse, the lawsuit said.\nThe outlet’s tax-exempt status means US taxpayers were subsidizing Hamas propaganda published to a US audience, the lawsuit argues, adding that the salary he was paid also helped him imprison the hostages."}

That act raised eyebrows at the Vatican and was denounced by former Italian premier Romano Prodi as indecent political interference in matters of faith.\nAnd last month, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops announced the end of a half-century of partnerships with the federal US government to serve refugees and migrant children, saying the “heartbreaking” decision followed the Trump administration’s abrupt halt to funding.\n00:00 / 00:00\nThe majority of Leo’s posts on the X platform are related to or in support of Catholic news and church initiatives. He rarely writes original content, but a look back through his social media timeline shows numerous posts sharing viewpoints opposed to moves aimed at restricting acceptance of migrants and refugees in the US.\nCriticism of Vance’s views\nVance, a convert to Catholicism, is currently the most high-profile Catholic in American politics. He’s drawn attention from the man who now leads the global church, with his views prompting Leo to return to X after a nearly two-year absence to share criticism.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nIn early February, Leo shared an article from a Catholic publication with the headline, “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others.”\nJD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others https://t.co/hDKPKuMXmu via @NCRonline\n— Robert Prevost (@drprevost) February 3, 2025\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt came days after Vance — in discussing critiques of the Trump administration’s immigration policies — in a Fox News interview had referenced a Christian tenet “that you love your family and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens, and then after that, prioritize the rest of the world.”\nIn response to online criticism of his position, Vance posted on X, “Just google ‘ordo amoris.’ Aside from that, the idea that there isn’t a hierarchy of obligations violates basic common sense.”\n“Ordo amoris,” a historic Catholic tenet, translates to “order of love.”\nTen days after his initial post, Leo shared another piece from a Jesuit publication, titled “Pope Francis’ letter, JD Vance’s ‘ordo amoris’ and what the Gospel asks of all of us on immigration.”\nPrior to his first February post, Leo had been dormant on X since July 2023.\nAfter Leo’s election Thursday, Vance posted congratulations on X, adding, ”I’m sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church. May God bless him!”\nADVERTISEMENT\nPope Leo is expected to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Pope Francis, a champion of the poor and of immigrants, who also had his differences with the Trump administration. Vance played down those differences after meeting with Francis at the Vatican the day before he died, but they were substantial. Francis had called Trump’s immigration policies a disgrace.\nPope Francis receives US Vice President JD Vance before bestowing the Urbi et Orbi (Latin for to the city and to the world) blessing at the end of the Easter mass presided over by Cardinal Angelo Comastri in St. Peter’s Square at the Vatican, April 20, 2025 (Vatican Media via AP, HO)\nThe new pope’s final post as Cardinal Robert Prevost was a recirculation on April 14 of a post by church chronicler Rocco Palmo about Trump’s Oval Office meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.\nBukele said it was “preposterous” for his country to bring a Maryland man who was wrongly deported there in March back to the US, despite a Supreme Court ruling calling on the administration to “facilitate” Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s return.\nLeo reposted Palmo’s link to an article by Washington-area Bishop Evelio Menjivar — who was born in El Salvador — asking, “Do you not see the suffering? Is your conscience not disturbed? How can you stay quiet?”\nLeo’s critiques of Trump date back nearly a decade.\nWhen Trump’s first presidential campaign ramped up in July 2015, he posted to X a Washington Post op-ed by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, with the headline, “Why Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric is so problematic.”\nIn the wake of Trump’s first election in 2016, Leo reposted a homily in which Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez — characterizing the fear among many, including schoolchildren who “think the government is going to come and deport their parents, any day now” — said that America is “better than this.”\nDays later, Leo also posted an article by a Catholic outlet quoting Democrats as saying that, in her loss, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton “ignored pro-lifers at her own peril.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nPope Francis elevates to cardinal the US prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops Robert Francis Prevost during a consistory to create 21 new cardinals at St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican on September 30, 2023.

Accordingly, the Israeli plan is to resume aid in the coming days or weeks.\nStill, the goal of the new initiative with GHF is to ensure that aid is not diverted by Hamas, something Israel says it hasn’t succeeded in doing since the start of the war.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCritics have argued that the government’s refusal to stand up a viable Palestinian alternative to Hamas has allowed the terror group to remain a dominant force in Gaza, even if it has taken debilitating blows due to Israeli military activities.\nPalestinians struggle to get donated food at a community kitchen in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, May 5, 2025.

Those entering the zone will pass through army checkpoints, in what the IDF hopes will prevent Hamas fighters from reaching the area.\nAid will be distributed from the SDSs in boxes that will contain 50 1,750-calorie meals, hygiene kits and medical supplies, according to the memo. Five to six thousand vetted representatives will be allowed to travel by foot to the aid hubs once every week or two in order to pick up a roughly 40-pound (18-kilogram) box of food for their families, said officials briefed on the plan.\n“To ensure the integrity and safety of aid delivery, GHF’s logistics subcontractors will utilize armored vehicles to transport supplies to and from SDS locations,” the memo states. The subcontractors will include American security firms, such as UG Solutions and Safe Reach Solutions, which helped secure the Netzarim Corridor earlier this year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe IDF will not be stationed at or near the SDSs in order to “maintain the neutral and civilian-facing nature of operations,” the memo said.\nDisplaced Palestinians cross a checkpoint manned by US and Egyptian security at the Netzarim Corridor as people make their way from the south to the north of the Gaza Strip, on Salah al-Din road, in central Gaza, on January 29, 2025.

The revelations sparked criticism of the prize committee from Israel’s Foreign Ministry and a call for the prize to be rescinded.\n“These are not word games – they are outright denials of documented atrocities,” Damari wrote in a letter to the prize board posted on X Thursday. “You claim to honor journalism that upholds truth, democracy, and human dignity. And yet you have chosen to elevate a voice that denies truth, erases victims, and desecrates the memory of the murdered.”\nDamari, a 28-year-old civilian with Israeli and British citizenship, was shot and taken from her Kfar Aza home on October 7, 2023.

That was no guarantee, however, that the cardinals would pick someone in his vein.\nThe question was whether to choose a pastor or diplomat, a liberal or conservative, someone versed in the Curia — the Church’s governing body — or a relative outsider from areas of the world where Catholic faith is thriving.\nBefore the cardinals were locked into the Sistine Chapel Wednesday, their dean Giovanni Battista Re urged them to choose someone able to protect the Church’s unity.\nThe next pope must also be able to lead “at this difficult and complex turning point in history,” amid raging conflicts around the world and the rise of ultra-nationalist parties.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Church has also had difficulty in adapting to the modern world, with declining priest numbers and increasingly empty pews in the West.\nThe papal inauguration usually takes place less than a week after the election with a mass celebrated before political and religious leaders from around the world.

We are also proud Jews.”\nFor at least one of them, that may have changed.\nBen Cohen, the Ben of the pair, appeared on Tucker Carlson’s talk show this week, mostly to discuss his opposition to US involvement in the Ukraine war and the Pentagon’s sprawling budget, issues where his long-touted progressive ideals can overlap with Carlson’s far-right ones.\nThen, at the end of the hour-long show, Carlson asked Cohen about his “spiritual beliefs.”\n“In terms of a spiritual belief, I mean, I don’t practice a religion,” Cohen responded. “I was born a Jew. I love Jesus Christ. I think the words that he said are wonderful, are amazing. And, you know, I’m kind of distressed that a lot of organized Christian religions are not really, I don’t know, abiding by the words of Jesus Christ.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nHe added, “I think if we could follow the words of Jesus Christ and think about the Sermon on the Mount and, you know, take his words seriously, we wouldn’t be doing the stuff we’re currently doing.”\nThe Sermon on the Mount, in the New Testament Gospel of Matthew, is a series of widely known sayings in which Jesus outlines his moral vision.\nCohen’s religious inclinations are significant because Carlson is known for inviting antisemites, including a Holocaust revisionist, onto his show in the past. They are also important because Cohen and his co-founder Jerry Greenfield publicly marshaled their Judaism in defense of their company’s 2021 boycott.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe boycott drew widespread opposition from centrist and right-leaning Jewish groups, a wave of state-level legal challenges and led to a court battle that lasted years. Cohen and Greenfield — who grew up attending Hebrew school together on Long Island — sold the company to Unilever decades ago and no longer control it, though recently Cohen was reportedly planning a buyback.\n“That we support the company’s decision is not a contradiction nor is it anti-Semitic,” the pair wrote in the Times op-ed. “In fact, we believe this act can and should be seen as advancing the concepts of justice and human rights, core tenets of Judaism.”\nLater, they added, “As Jewish supporters of the State of Israel, we fundamentally reject the notion that it is anti-Semitic to question the policies of the State of Israel.”\nThe Carlson show, posted on Monday, also raises questions about whether Cohen would still identify as a supporter of Israel. The bulk of the interview was about Ukraine and the US defense budget, but near the end, when discussing why he thinks “we’re kind of headed toward war” in Iran, Cohen brought up Israel.\n“There seems to be some kind of strange relationship between Israel and the US, where, I don’t know, Israel now has the US supplying weapons for its genocide,” Cohen said. “And what I’m told is that Israel wants some concept of greater Israel. I mean, I don’t really know much about that.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n(The term “greater Israel” has generally referred to Israeli control of territories such as the West Bank and Gaza, rather than its regional conflict with Iran.)\nIn response to a subsequent question, he said, “Right now what it means to be American is that we are the world’s largest arms exporter, we have the largest military in the world, we support the slaughter of people in Gaza, if somebody protests the slaughter of people in Gaza, we arrest them. What does our country stand for?”\nThis is not the first time this year that Cohen has accused Israel of genocide in its war against Hamas in Gaza, a charge the country strenuously rejects. In March, he said, “The US supporting this genocide is essentially trampling on the soul of America,” and added, “It’s not a war, it’s a slaughter. I don’t think there’s much difference between somebody getting killed by a bomb or getting killed by being thrown in a gas chamber.”\nIn the interview on Monday, Carlson did not address Cohen’s statements on Israel. He seconded Cohen’s praise of Jesus.\nCohen has also recently begun promoting a website to back DOGE, the Elon Musk-run operation that has rapidly slashed parts of the federal government, including large global humanitarian programs. A request for comment via that website, which Cohen touts on his X account, was not immediately returned."}

The US president said the attacks were meant to stop Houthi strikes on ships. But the Houthis haven’t claimed an attack on a commercial ship since December 27, and the last verified attack was in November.\nThe US military also lost seven Reaper drones since the expanded American attacks began in March, each costing $28 million. And it lost two F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets, which are worth at least $67 million each.\nThis image, taken from video provided by the US Navy, shows an aircraft launching from the USS Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea before airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen, March 15, 2025. (US Navy via AP)\n“We’re basically back to where we were four months ago, just with many lives lost in Yemen and after considerable expenses to the US taxpayer,” argued Wolf-Christian Paes, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “The Houthis will use this as an opportunity to regroup and rearm, while the US is further weakened.”\n“The ceasefire’s artificial separation between the October 7 war and the Red Sea means that the Houthis will be able to rest, refit and attack Israel,” said Brian Carter of the American Enterprise Institute. “All while implementing the lessons they learned fighting the US Navy and preparing for new escalation against the United States and its allies that could begin at any time and for any reason.”\nHe expressed his belief that “the United States will need to fight the Houthis again in the future.”\nYet some experts were more optimistic about the ceasefire.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The unexpected announcement by Trump that the Houthis are in fact capitulating would be a major victory and powerful affirmation of Trump’s instincts in wielding US power,” said John Hannah, senior fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA) and former national security adviser to US Vice President Dick Cheney.\n“If it’s true, Iran better take heed.”\nIsrael running out of targets\nIf the Houthis do continue firing at Israeli-linked civilian ships and at the country itself, Israel is unlikely to be capable of forcing them to stop through airstrikes.\nIt’s not even clear that hundreds of US strikes are what caused the Houthis to agree to a ceasefire with Washington.\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree speaks at a rally against the US and Israel in Sanaa, Yemen, April 18, 2025.

There was a noticeable drop in Houthi attacks on civilian shipping and in total attacks starting in the summer of 2024. The recent intensified campaign took out leaders, stockpiles, and infrastructure. Resupply is becoming harder for the Houthis, and they’ve fired much of their high-end arsenal.\nBut even facing hundreds of US strikes, they continued shooting at US military vessels and at Israel.\nThough Israel has shown it is capable of pulling off long-range raids in Yemen, it would not be able to match the US operational tempo.\nFire and smoke can be seen rising in the distance in a video captured in Yemen following an Israeli strike on the Houthi-controlled Hodeidah port, September 29, 2024.

Israeli jets have hit the Hodeidah port on four separate occasions, boasting about the impact on the Houthis’ economy and military every time. Against powerful foes, the Houthis have proven resilient. As in Afghanistan, Yemen’s mountainous terrain is a valuable asset to guerrilla groups facing aerial attacks.\nAnd over the years, they have learned how to adapt to aerial campaigns, hiding key assets or moving them underground.\nIt appears Israel may run out of meaningful targets before the Houthis run out of missiles.\n‘Pure Jihadi gold’\nEven if Israel is able to strike consistently, the Houthis have many reasons to keep firing at the Jewish state.\nADVERTISEMENT\nViolence against Israel and the US is central to the Houthi ideology. As the group’s slogan goes: “God Is the Greatest, Death to America, Death to Israel, A Curse Upon the Jews, Victory to Islam.”\nA poor tribal group in the desert that almost no one had heard of 15 years ago, the Houthis are now enjoying unprecedented popularity across the Muslim world as the vanguard of the fight against Israel.\nHouthi supporters chant slogans during a weekly anti-US and anti-Israel rally in Sanaa, Yemen, April 11, 2025.

It’s pure Jihadi gold.”\nIt’s also a convenient means of diverting public attention from the widespread poverty, hunger and corruption in Yemen. Houthi attacks are far more popular than the group itself. An October poll found that only 8% of respondents in Houthi-controlled areas viewed the group favorably, while 35% approved of the attacks.\nA malnourished Yemeni child receives treatment at a hospital in the Yemeni port city of Hodeidah on November 5, 2017.

Trump surprised Jerusalem with his announcement, and didn’t seem to care much about what it meant for Israel’s security.\nThis mirrors the nightmare scenario for Israel as Trump pursues nuclear talks with Iran.\nWith Israel on the sidelines, the president could suddenly announce a deal with Iran that leaves its nuclear program intact. Israel would find itself isolated, and unlike in the Houthi case, it would be inconceivable that it would attack Iran after an agreement with Trump.\nThe US president has talked tough on Iran. Yet his partiality toward agreements with enemies through direct talks seems to be driving policy, and Israel’s point men — Ambassador Yechiel Leiter and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer — have failed to influence policy or even keep abreast of secret talks.\nWith Trump coming to the region next week, and not planning to stop in Israel, more surprises could be in store."}

He flew home without so much as a stopover in Israel, the United States’ one and only democratic, ultra-dependable ally in this part of the world.\nBy contrast, Donald Trump, in his first visit anywhere overseas as president, spent two days in Israel in May 2017, stood with his head bowed at the Western Wall and highlighted what he said was his “privilege” to address the people of Israel in the ancient city of Jerusalem. “I make this promise to you,” he declared in the final public event of his visit, at the Israel Museum, “my administration will always stand with Israel.”\n00:00 / 00:00\n“Iran’s leaders routinely call for Israel’s destruction,” Trump noted bitterly in that same speech, and then departed from the prepared text on the teleprompters to vow: “Not with Donald J Trump, believe me!” His audience, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, stood and cheered. “Thank you,” he said three times, as the applause went on and on.

The “very, very big announcement” he is teasing ahead of his departure could remake any understanding of what he is planning and doing in this region. But for Israel, from a president with a proven first-term record of dramatic pro-Israel action — recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the US embassy here, brokering the Abraham Accords, and withdrawing from the Obama-led, terribly flawed 2015 JCPOA agreement on Iran’s nuclear program — the words and deeds in these first 100-plus days are increasingly worrying.\nWithout informing Israel in advance, he opened direct talks with Hamas, via an emissary, Adam Boehler, who plainly did not recognize Hamas’s eliminate-Israel raison d’être, overseen by his most important foreign policy envoy, Steve Witkoff, who also thinks Hamas is not “ideologically intractable.”\nSpringing the news on Netanyahu just before telling the rest of the world, with a helpless prime minister at his side in the Oval Office, he initiated talks with Iran, again with Witkoff in the leading role. And he and his key officials have spent the past month flipping back and forth on whether a deal that he says “is going to happen” will require the cessation of all Iranian uranium enrichment… or not, and will entail the dismantling of all Iran’s nuclear facilities… or not. Meaning, it will actually prevent a regime dead-set on attaining a nuclear weapons arsenal from achieving that goal, with Israel its prime target… or not.\nADVERTISEMENT\nApparently without significant consultation with Netanyahu, he had previously unveiled a bizarre vision for taking over and leveling Gaza, and turning it into a Middle East real estate “riviera” development project, shifting characteristically again on whether this would involve the forced expulsion of all Gazans, and offering no credible mechanism for distinguishing between the “wonderful” non-Hamas Gazans he would rehouse who-knows-where and the inhumane Hamas Gazans who would need to be eliminated.\nSmoke in the area of Ben Gurion Airport after a ballistic missile was fired at Israel from Yemen on May 4, 2025 (Screen grab from social media used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)\nAnd then on Tuesday, two days after Yemen’s Houthi terror group breached Israel’s usually effective air defenses and fired a ballistic missile into the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport, a few hundred yards from the main control tower — prompting almost every international airline to cancel their flights to and from our beleaguered little country — he announced that he had reached an agreement with the Houthis under which the US would no longer be targeting their assets.\nAstonishingly, again, he did not forewarn Israel — a country whose own airlines are now its only dependable connection to the rest of the world, as a direct consequence of the malevolent activities of a terror group he has now let off the hook. If the president made an effort to require that the Houthis stop targeting Israel as part of his deal with them, he evidently did not insist upon it, since the Houthis followed his latest bombshell-for-Israel announcement by stating that they would indeed continue to attack us and, indeed, fired a drone in our direction on Wednesday morning.\nWere it not for that dramatically Israel-supportive first term — not just rhetoric, but demonstrative, incredibly far-reaching action — you might be forgiven for wondering whether Trump had taken office at strategic odds with Israel, or at least fairly indifferent to Israel, perhaps in the grip of the personal anti-Netanyahu animus that was so evident when he declared “Fuck him,” in comments published in January 2021, because the prime minister had ostensibly been too quick to congratulate Joe Biden on winning the 2020 presidential elections.\nTrump came into office, this time around, promising to stop wars and to put America first. The first of those goals, if achievable, is entirely laudable and hugely beneficial to humankind. And every nation’s leader has a primary obligation to look first to his or her country’s interests. But you cannot partially stop wars, or cut deals with enemy nations, solely on the basis of your country’s self-interest, least of all when you’re the head of a global superpower and your presidential role includes leadership of the free world. That would constitute the abandonment of your allies and only a fleeting victory for America’s own interests, since the genocidal enemies the free world is facing cannot be subdued by — indeed are empowered by — short-term and inadequate agreements.\nAs things stand, Israel has widening cause for concern from a US president that our leadership and a sizable majority of the nation were confident would put Israel’s wellbeing high on his global agenda. That “very, very big announcement” better be a real zinger.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signs a guest book at the White House as US President Donald Trump looks on in Washington DC, April 7, 2025 (Avi Ohayon/GPO)\nGoing up in flames\nWith the US led by an unpredictable leader, the need for Israel to come together in its own defense has never been greater.\nIsrael has always championed its capacity to defend itself, by itself, but has also depended on core external allies for military, diplomatic and all manner of other practical and psychological support. Since October 7, with the despicable rush to blame the victim — Israel, as it has struggled to defang Gaza’s entrenched, cynical, Hamas government and to secure the release of our hostages — that international support has been in perhaps unprecedentedly steep decline.\nYet Netanyahu continues to whip up internal divides, by decrying all political and public opponents as tools of our enemies, hacking away at all independent state institutions, discrediting the judiciary, and upholding the ultra-Orthodox community’s refusal to serve even as the burden on our reserves forces weighs ever more heavily.\nIDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir (center) is seen in Gaza City’s Shejaiya neighborhood, April 15, 2025. (Israel Defense Forces)\nNow he is about to embark on a vastly expanded military operation in Gaza — which risks endangering the hostages, will see more soldiers killed, will kill more Gazans, but which Netanyahu insists will succeed where 18 months of warfare have failed in achieving “total victory.” He claims the latest war plan was produced and recommended by the IDF’s chief of staff.\nYet his far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, on whose support he depends, enthused this week that this operation will eventuate not in the replacement of Hamas by reliable local, regional and/or international governance, but in the “total destruction” of Gaza, the confining of its population to a narrow border area, and the permanent reoccupation of the Strip by Israel and Israeli forces, which is certainly not the IDF’s declared goal.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) in a video with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich after passing the 2025 state budget, March 25, 2025.

So we can only hope.\n“The ties of the Jewish people to this Holy Land are ancient and eternal. They date back thousands of years, including the reign of King David, whose star now flies proudly on Israel’s white and blue flag.” So said Donald Trump, first-term president of the United States, in Jerusalem on May 23, 2017 — doing what his predecessor had failed to in stressing our connection to this land, on an early visit to Israel that his predecessor had chosen not to make.\n“But a hopeful future for children in the Middle East requires the world to fully recognize the vital role of the state of Israel,” Trump went on. “And, on behalf of the United States, we pledge to stand by you and defend our shared values so that together we can defeat terrorism and create safety for all of God’s children.”\nAmen to that."}
{"title": "Chair of UK Oct. 7 report: ‘Denial started while the massacres were still ongoing’", "date": "9 May 2025, 9:31 am", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/chair-of-uk-oct-7-report-denial-started-while-the-massacres-were-still-ongoing/", "type": "article", "content": "LONDON — With its minute-by-minute timeline, copious testimony from survivors and eyewitnesses, and wealth of forensic evidence and open-source footage, the 316-page report produced by British parliamentarians last month detailing the terrible events of October 7, 2023, is a comprehensive and meticulous account of the Hamas onslaught on Israel.\nThat is unsurprising. The panel responsible for the “7 October Parliamentary Commission Report” was chaired by Andrew Roberts, a renowned historian, biographer and expert on warfare, from the Battle of Waterloo to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\nIt isn’t simply Roberts’s longstanding support for Israel that led him to agree to chair the commission, but his concern over continuing attempts to whitewash Hamas’s atrocities — an effort he compares to Holocaust denial.\n“There’s a movement afoot on behalf of Hamas and its sympathizers to pretend that October 7 never happened,” he tells The Times of Israel. The report’s aim was to compile “a large amount of unimpeachable evidence to prove that it did.”\nWith an eye on history, Roberts also wanted to gather irrefutable proof to ensure that, in future decades, “the deniers” can still be challenged, even in the absence of living eyewitnesses.\nRoberts, who is not Jewish, does not underestimate the scale of the challenge.\n“It took decades for Holocaust denial to really get going,” he says, “but October 7 denial started while the actual massacres were still going [on].”\nHe recognizes that Hamas’s denial of its crimes contains multiple grim ironies. Pointing to the GoPro cameras worn by the terrorists as they perpetrated murder, torture and rape, he notes the group and its allies are “attempting to deny something that they themselves have provided the best evidence for.”\nRoberts also believes that Hamas is trying to “have their cake and eat it.”\n“They are trying to celebrate something they deny happened, and deny something that they’ve celebrated happening,” he says. “It’s unlike anything else, really. Speaking as a historian, you’ve got to come down on one side or the other about an occasion [or] a big historical event like October 7, and you’ve got to say that either it happened, and it was terrible, or that it didn’t happen.”\n“You can’t have it both ways, and yet that’s what Hamas and its supporters in the West are trying to get,” he adds.\nDepravity of human nature, filmed in real-time\nRoberts, who sits as a Conservative member of the House of Lords, and fellow members of the panel — who include Labour and Liberal Democrat parliamentarians and a former UK chief prosecutor — visited Israel and the scenes of some of the October 7 attacks. Roberts says it was both the “breadth as well as the depth” of the assault that struck him — not just the murder of some 1,200 people and abduction of 251, but the “depravity of human nature that was seen, the sheer cruelty, the sexual violence and the humiliation.”\nRoberts speaks of the “bloodlust” displayed by the assailants — they killed a 10-month-old baby and a Holocaust survivor in his 90s — as well as the “premeditation of the cruelty.”\nBlood is seen splattered in a child’s room following a massive Hamas terror onslaught on October 7, 2023, in Kibbutz Nir Oz, October 19, 2023 (AP/Francisco Seco)\nHistorically, he says, this is unusual. “Bloodlust happens a lot in history, but it’s very rare that it’s been set up so diligently and with such foresight — ‘malice aforethought’ as it used to be called,” he says.\nThe report of the 7 October Parliamentary commission, which was established by the All Party UK-Israel Parliamentary Group, isn’t an official publication of the House of Commons or the House of Lords. Roberts accepts that it has already been written off by some on social media as “Zionist propaganda” — the internet, he jokes, has become “the universal lavatory wall” — but he believes it cannot easily be “intellectually and rationally written off.”\n“Bloodlust happens a lot in history, but it’s very rare that it’s been set up so diligently and with such foresight — ‘malice aforethought’ as it used to be called”\nThe panel was careful to stick to verifiable facts, avoid speculation and focus simply on the events of October 7, he says.\n“We were not attempting to do what other reports could do better, which is to look into the intelligence failures and everything else that happened in the background to it,” Roberts says.\nThe report argues that Hamas knew that “military victory was unlikely” and instead sought to trigger an Israeli retaliation, which would isolate the country internationally and spark global outrage. However, Roberts disputes the notion that, on these terms, Hamas has already emerged victorious.\nIsraeli soldiers at the forensic center in the Shura military base near Ramle, where hundreds of bodies arrived after the October 7 Hamas onslaught, October 24, 2023. (Yossi Aloni/Flash90)\n“In terms of the propaganda war, I think they have won in that on these disgusting, ridiculous social media sites, like TikTok and Instagram, you’re getting… 10 times more anti-Israel propaganda than pro-Israeli facts and truth,” he acknowledges.\nBut, he continues, the war itself is not over and it won’t be possible to say either side has won until both sides have stopped fighting — a prospect that seems some way off. Indeed, quoting Winston Churchill’s famous words upon becoming UK prime minister in 1940, Roberts believes that Israel will eventually prevail, but it will take “a lot more blood, toil, tears and sweat.”\nCheckered history of surprise attacks\nRoberts’s belief that Hamas can be vanquished rests in part on the checkered history of surprise attacks. They may give the attacker a momentary advantage, but, with a “very few” exceptions — such as the 1967 Six Day War, when Israel launched a preemptive strike — they rarely lead to ultimate success. The Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Yom Kippur assault on Israel in October 1973, Argentina’s invasion of the Falkland Islands in April 1982, and Saddam Hussein’s grab for Kuwait in August 1990 did not see the aggressor triumph.\nWhile undertaking a surprise attack “seems like a good idea at the time… ultimately, it leads to a much worse situation for the people who launch [it],” believes Roberts. “If you launch a barbarous and vicious surprise attack, you shouldn’t be surprised about the response,” the historian says, noting the “holy rage and fury” that is stirred on the part of those who have been attacked.\n“If you launch a barbarous and vicious surprise attack, you shouldn’t be surprised about the response”\nThe author of an acclaimed biography of Churchill, Roberts has previously compared Israel’s position to that of Britain in 1940.\n“In that 12-month period from June 1940 to June 1941, Britain and her Commonwealth formed the tip of the spear against ‘the menace of tyranny,’ just as brave Israel today represents the tip of civilization’s spear against the tyranny and barbarism of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism and exterminationism,” he wrote in the Jewish Chronicle last October.\nRoberts readily admits, however, that Britain, which had not yet been joined by the US and Russia but had strong backing from the Empire and Commonwealth, was less alone than Israel is today. With the exception of the US, he says, “it’s difficult to look around the world and see countries that are really four-square behind Israel in what is essentially a struggle between civilization and barbarism.”\nHe worries that people in the West “enjoy attacking ourselves… and berating ourselves” for “perfectly reasonable” responses to surprise attacks such as 9/11 or October 7. He contrasts the response to Pearl Harbor.\nA handout photograph released by the UK Parliament shows Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, making a statement on the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 and the situation in the Middle East, in the House of Commons in London on October 7, 2024 (JESSICA TAYLOR / UK PARLIAMENT / AFP)\n“Nobody attacked FDR [who was US president at the outbreak of World War II], or, indeed at the time, [US] president Truman [under whose administration a nuclear bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki], for punishing the attack on Pearl Harbor as condignly as they did, whereas today, everybody seems to be leaping up and down, criticizing the West for punishing these equally horrific attacks,” Roberts says.\nNonetheless, Roberts is convinced that Churchill would have recognized and sympathized with Israel’s position today.\n“He was a Zionist. He didn’t subscribe to [the] antisemitism that so many of the people of his age, class and background did. He was a supporter of the Balfour Declaration and believed that the ‘Judeo’ side of Judeo-Christian civilization… gave Christianity its ethics and its positive moral angle,” he says.\nRoberts says that Churchill’s daughter had once warned him never to assume what the former prime minister would have said about any event after his death in 1965, but he is happy to wager an opinion.\n“It strikes me as very clear that he would have been as outraged as any other decent, rational, logical human being about what had happened on October 7, and he would certainly have been in favor of a terrible punishment raining down on Hamas,” Roberts says. “He was a humanitarian and so he’d have wanted to have minimized the civilian casualties in Gaza, and I believe that the IDF have done that to the best of their ability.”\nPerhaps, like Roberts, Churchill would also have seen a commonality between the enemy he defeated and that which Israel faces.\n“The overlap between Hamas ideology and Nazi ideology is so well colored in on the Venn diagram”\n“The overlap between Hamas ideology and Nazi ideology is so well colored in on the Venn diagram,” Roberts says.\nOf course, he adds, it is always “difficult and dangerous” to draw direct historical analogies. Hamas’s murderous rampage cannot be compared with the industrial-scale killing carried out by the Nazis, even if the former wore GoPro cameras and broadcast their “monstrous actions” on Facebook while the latter tried to cover up their crimes and destroy the gas chambers in 1945.\n“The analogy between Hamas and the Nazis strikes me as completely obvious one,” Roberts says. “I think you’d have to be deliberately obtuse not to see the connections.”\nThe Hamas attacks of October 7 and the ensuing conflict have confirmed Roberts’s belief that launching a war is a “profoundly immoral” act.\n“Wars are truly terrible things, which is why you shouldn’t start them,” he says, “and why you should fight them in as humanitarian a way as you can, which I think is what Israel has done.”"}

But on Thursday afternoon, just after 6 p.m. (1600 GMT), the smoke emitted was white, confirming that the Catholic Church has a new spiritual leader.\nIt was unknown how many ballots it took to elect the new pope, but it followed recent history in wrapping up in less than two days.\nIn 2005, Benedict XVI, a German theologian, was elected in four ballots and Francis, in 2013, was elected in five ballots.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPope Francis at the main balcony of St Peter’s Basilica during the Urbi et Orbi message and blessing to the city and the world as part of Easter celebrations, in The Vatican, April 20, 2025.

That act raised eyebrows at the Vatican and was denounced by former Italian premier Romano Prodi as indecent political interference in matters of faith.\nAnd last month, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops announced the end of a half-century of partnerships with the federal US government to serve refugees and migrant children, saying the “heartbreaking” decision followed the Trump administration’s abrupt halt to funding.\nThe majority of Leo’s posts on the X platform are related to or in support of Catholic news and church initiatives. He rarely writes original content, but a look back through his social media timeline shows numerous posts sharing viewpoints opposed to moves aimed at restricting acceptance of migrants and refugees in the US.\nCriticism of Vance’s views\nVance, a convert to Catholicism, is currently the most high-profile Catholic in American politics.

Is your conscience not disturbed? How can you stay quiet?”\nLeo’s critiques of Trump date back nearly a decade.\nWhen Trump’s first presidential campaign ramped up in July 2015, he posted to X a Washington Post op-ed by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, with the headline, “Why Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric is so problematic.”\nIn the wake of Trump’s first election in 2016, Leo reposted a homily in which Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez — characterizing the fear among many, including schoolchildren who “think the government is going to come and deport their parents, any day now” — said that America is “better than this.”\nDays later, Leo also posted an article by a Catholic outlet quoting Democrats as saying that, in her loss, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton “ignored pro-lifers at her own peril.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nPope Francis elevates to cardinal the US prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops Robert Francis Prevost during a consistory to create 21 new cardinals at St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican on September 30, 2023.

John T. Pawlikowski, who taught for nearly half a century at the Catholic Theological Union until his retirement in 2017, served as co-founder and director of the school’s Catholic-Jewish Studies Program and also served four terms on the board of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.\nMore than 40 years after Leo’s ordination as a priest, Pawlikowski remembers the new pope as a good student with an open mind.\n“I do remember him as a pretty bright student,” Pawlikowski said in an interview shortly after his former student was introduced to the world as the sitting bishop of Rome.\nPawlikowski added later, “My experience of him was he’s a very open-minded person who’s very much in the context of Vatican II.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nVatican II, or the Second Vatican Council, inaugurated a new era in Jewish-Catholic relations in 1965 when it issued a document, Nostra Aetate, repudiating antisemitism and stating that the Jewish people were not responsible for Jesus’ death. Ties between the two religious communities were blossoming at the time when Leo was studying for the priesthood in the late 1970s and early ‘80s.\nUnder Pawlikowski, Leo studied Catholic social teaching, which focuses on social and economic issues. Pawlikowski says relations with Jews are relevant to that field. CTU has also had a commitment to Catholic-Jewish relations since its founding and launched its formal program in the field in 1968.\nPeople hold up a US flag as the newly elected Pope Leo XIV appears at the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican, May 8, 2025. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\n“I’ve always argued that antisemitism is something that has to be counted as part of the Catholic commitment to social justice and human dignity,” he said. “My work on Catholic social teaching did include always the issue of antisemitism.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe pope spent much of his career in Peru and is thought of as a relative centrist and Vatican insider. He hasn’t been a prominent figure in Jewish-Catholic dialogue or fighting antisemitism, and doesn’t appear to have commented publicly on Israel or the war in Gaza, sparked by the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, assault. Pope Francis, his predecessor, did opine on those issues and had relations with Jewish leaders in his native Argentina.\nBut Leo’s coming of age in the era of Vatican II — plus his roots in Chicago, which has a large Jewish community, also leads Rabbi Noam Marans, the American Jewish Committee’s director of interreligious and intergroup relations, to feel optimistic.\n“He studied at CTU under John Pawlikowski and in the post-Nostra Aetate era, in the country where Catholic-Jewish relations are preeminent,” Marans said in an interview. “An American pope bodes well for the future of Catholic-Jewish relations. More than anywhere in the world, the relationship between Catholics and Jews has flourished and set a gold standard in the United States.”\nWhile Francis was outspoken in his opposition to antisemitism and his promotion of ties with Jews, he raised the ire of some Jewish leaders in recent years for his criticism of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. One of his last acts as pope was to donate his popemobile to Gaza as a mobile medical unit.\nPope Francis flanked by Rabbi Riccardo Di Segni, right, during his visit to the Great Synagogue of Rome, Sunday, Jan. 17, 2016. (AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino)\nPawlikowski said he believes “there’s a desire to carry on” with Catholic-Jewish relations, though he added, “the situation in Israel and Gaza has had a dramatic effect.”\nWill his former student begin a new chapter in Catholic-Jewish ties? Pawlikowski said it’s too soon to tell, given that Leo has not thus far focused on the issue.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“He hasn’t really been stationed in any area where there was a really pronounced Jewish community,” he said. “On the question of interreligious [affairs], he’ll have to show us where he is, but I would assume he had an outgoing, positive attitude generally.”\nIn his first address as pope, Leo issued a call to dialogue.\n“Help us as well — help one another — to build bridges through dialogue, through encounter, uniting everyone to be one single people always in peace,” he said.\nRabbi Joshua Stanton, associate vice president for interfaith and intergroup initiatives at the Jewish Federations of North America, saw that as a sign that the pope is committed to Catholic-Jewish relations. He noted that this year is Nostra Aetate’s 60th anniversary, which he hopes Leo commemorates in an active way.\n“I’m very hopeful that he referenced the importance of dialogue and reaching out beyond the Catholic Church to other religious communities,” Stanton said. Stanton noted that Leo has a reputation for “quiet efficacy,” and as he settles into his position, Stanton said he’ll be looking at how the pontiff acts.\n“Does he invite Jewish leaders to the Vatican to meet with him?” he said. “Does he invite leaders from other traditions? Does he try to bring multiple groups together at the same time?”\nThe focus of Leo’s address on Thursday was peace. With war raging in Gaza, Marans did not take that as a specific reference to the Middle East.\n“All popes want peace,” he said. “May I add, all Catholics, Jews, rabbis want peace.”"}

Israel’s food security seems to be just fine. Even war caused only minor shortages in some food products, usually temporary and quickly resolved.\nLook beneath the surface, however, and you’ll find a multitude of stresses on the delicate Israeli food supply chain.\nThe Dangers of Dependence\nIsrael imports $7.1 billion in food and agricultural products annually, while their exports are only $2.2 billion. Israel is fully dependent on imports for grain, sugar and vegetable oils, as well as for animal feed, upon which depends the local production of dairy, chicken and eggs.\nAdditionally, Israel sees consistent growth in food demands, both due to increasing quality of life and to a stable annual population growth of two percent.\nWhile self-sufficiency is an important component in food security for any country, the events of the past 18 months have underscored its importance for Israel. Extensive missile damage to agricultural lands. A shortage of foreign agricultural workers. Threats of foreign boycotts. Attacks on Red Sea trade routes.\nFood security is a critical part of national security. In a country like Israel with limited land and water resources, plus a challenging geopolitical situation, it requires a multi-faceted solution.\nKKL-JNF is utilizing over 120 years of involvement with the land to support Israel’s farmers and food security in a wide range of ways, from developing advanced technology to boosting nature’s own built-in mechanisms.\nTrees for Bees (and Farmers)\nBy supporting the long-term stability of Israel’s honeybee population, KKL-JNF’s planting initiative directly benefits Israel’s farmers, agriculture and food security. (Yoav Lin, KKL-JNF Photo Archive)\nThe impact of bees on our food goes way beyond honey. Honeybees are essential pollinators, supporting the growth of many agricultural crops, including apples, cucumbers, and melons- all key produce in Israel’s farmlands. Bee pollination contributes billions of shekels annually to Israel’s agricultural economy. Without healthy bee populations, crop yields decline, threatening both food security and the livelihoods of farmers.\nUnfortunately, Israel’s honeybee population is under threat due to general global factors such as urbanization and climate change, as well as specific local factors such as war damage to nectar-rich habitats that supported bee populations.\nTo address the issue, KKL-JNF partnered with Israel’s Pollination and Honey Council to plant 30,000 nectar-producing trees and shrubs across Israel. The variety of these plantings help maintain stable bee populations even outside major crop flowering seasons and provide the nutrients bees need for long-term health and sustainability.\nOfi Reich, CEO of the Pollination and Honey Council, explains: “Nectar-planting efforts are of utmost importance for preserving Israel’s agriculture and food production and for reviving agricultural areas in the north and south.”\nBy supporting the long-term stability of Israel’s honeybee population, KKL-JNF’s planting initiative directly benefits Israel’s farmers, agriculture and food security.\nLearn more and support KKL-JN\nCultivating Farmlands in the Western Negev\nWestern Negev farmland under cultivation. (Bonnie Scheinman -KKL-JNF Photo Archive)\nThe Western Negev is the backbone of Israel’s fresh produce supply. Before October 7, 2023, this region provided 75% of Israel’s vegetables and 20% of its fruit, underscoring its vital role in the nation’s food production.\nDue to its proximity to Gaza, the Western Negev has always been vulnerable, facing constant terror attacks, rocket fire, and incendiary balloons that have burned forests, fields, and greenhouses. On October 7th, Hamas deliberately sabotaged farmland, poultry farms and dairy farms in an attempt to cause severe harm to Israel’s economy and food supply.\nKKL-JNF stepped up in response to this threat to Israel’s agriculture. They began to prepare unused Western Negev land for immediate cultivation, providing area farmers with the critical resources they need to rebuild their livelihoods and strengthen their families and communities.\n“As the largest predominantly farming Council that has paid the highest price, today we say, ‘We are here and we are staying here’,” expresses Gadi Yarkoni, Head of the Eshkol Regional Council. “After many years of efforts on the part of the Council, thousands of dunams of cleared firing range lands have been handed over from the IDF to the Council. Now, through the KKL-JNF, we have begun the process of repurposing them for farmlands and for development of blue-white agriculture, which is the region’s settlement anchor. This is extremely good news of symbolic value as well. It is especially encouraging during these days in that it strengthens and develops the settlement in Eshkol.”\nTurning raw land into productive farmland – especially within a short time frame- requires expertise in agriculture and engineering. The process includes clearing, leveling, grading and ensuring the soil is fit for crops.\n“The greatest challenge is working swiftly and accurately while maintaining the highest standards,” explains Yossi Otmazgin, Director of the Execution and Infrastructure Unit for KKL-JNF’s Southern Region.\nKKL-JNF invested significant resources into preparing 300 acres of land, handing the now arable land over to Western Negev farmers in January and February 2025.\nGilad Altman, Project Manager for the Eshkol Regional Council, defines KKL-JNF’s efforts as “first-class Zionist work – developing new agricultural areas so we can welcome new families, expand our communities and help the entire region flourish once more.”\nAgriculture, Renewed\nKKL-JNF’s planting initiatives directly benefit Israel’s farmers, agriculture and food security. (Yoav Lin – KKL-JNF)\nIt takes energy to accomplish anything, including producing food. Is it possible to increase food production to provide the needs of Israel’s growing population, while decreasing reliance on non-renewable energy sources and greenhouse gas emissions?\nKKL-JNF responds in the affirmative, investing resources into research and practical applications at the intersection of renewable energy and agriculture, otherwise known as agrivoltaic farming.\nInstead of just consuming energy, agrivoltaic farms also produce energy. Solar panels are an integral part of the agricultural setup, with the crops grown in the fields or greenhouses directly under the panels. KKL-JNF is a major collaborator in the first agrivoltaic pilot project in Israel, established at Kibbutz Ma’ale Gilboa in the Beit She’an Valley.\nKKL-JNF sees agrivoltaic farming as key to a sustainable future for Israel’s agriculture industry. (Michael Huri, KKL-JNF Photo Archive)\nKKL-JNF sees agrivoltaic farming as key to a sustainable future for Israel’s agriculture industry. It reduces reliance on fossil fuel-based energy and optimizes land and resource use, enabling the same physical area to be used for both agriculture and energy production.\nIn addition, more electricity available in close proximity to the agricultural land makes it more feasible to introduce precision agriculture: robotics and other automation technology as part of agricultural processes. The renewal of agriculture as a field that encompasses both advanced technology and values such as sustainability can play a key role in attracting the younger generations back to agriculture.\nKKL-JNF is directly involved in research on how to optimize agrivoltaic farming, with the most recent UN international climate conference in Baku, Azerbaijan featuring a presentation by KKL-JNF Chief Scientist Dr. Doron Merkel on the results of an in-the-field research study.\nThe Long Road to Independence\nIsrael’s food security has come a long way from rationing out flour, sugar and oil.

But despite the sense of plenty, there are still strides to be made toward greater self-sufficiency and true food security.\nThis critical work lies in the hands of the next generation of Israel’s agriculturalists, as well as organizations like KKL-JNF that are committed to actively supporting Israel’s farmers and sustaining Israel’s people.\nLearn More and Support KKL-JNF"}

An Israeli official said the three, whom he did not identify, are considered alive until there is evidence proving otherwise. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIf there is “new information being kept from us, give it to us immediately,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an advocacy group, said Wednesday.\nSome 5,600 Hamas-led terrorists killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 251 during their invasion of southern Israel on October 7, 2023. Elkana Bohbot and dozens of others were grabbed from a music festival, where more than 300 people were slaughtered.\nIsrael responded with a military offensive to destroy Hamas, topple its regime, and free the hostages.\nThe Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 50,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though the toll cannot be verified and does not differentiate between civilians and fighters.\nIsrael says it has killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.\nIsrael’s toll in the ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza and in military operations along the border with the Strip stands at 416.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraeli hostage Elkana Bohbot speaks in a Hamas propaganda video issued on March 29, 2025.

In the most recent video, from mid-April, Elkana holds a fake telephone conversation with his wife, Rivka; their son, Re’em; his mother; and his brother — pleading with them to help him get out of Gaza.\nWhile the videos were a sign of life, Bohbot knows that they don’t guarantee that her son is still alive. Hearing the government’s approval this week to expand operations in Gaza deepened her concern about the fate of her son and the other hostages. Israel is “failing so utterly” to rescue the hostages, she said.\nIsrael’s decision to freeze all humanitarian aid likely meant her son also wasn’t getting food, she said. Humanitarian aid is the primary food source for 80 percent of Palestinians in Gaza, the World Food Program said in its monthly report for April, though that figure has likely risen in the past month.\n“I just want to imagine that he’s holding on and that he’s okay for now, that’s my hope and that’s my belief right now,” she said.\nIsrael stopped allowing aid into Gaza on March 2 after the first phase of a ceasefire and hostage release deal ended, leading many organizations to warn of severe malnutrition and hunger in Gaza. Jerusalem argued that Hamas diverted much of the aid that entered during the six-week truce, but said that the 650 trucks per day were enough to feed the population for an extended period. Israel says it won’t allow food, fuel, water, or medicine into the territory until it puts in place a system giving it control over the distribution.\nThe IDF reportedly plans to transition away from wholesale distribution and warehousing of aid and to instead have international organizations and private security contractors hand out boxes of food to individual Gazan families, according to Israeli and Arab officials familiar with the matter. The UN and aid groups have rejected the proposal.\nRuhama Bohbot, mother of hostage Elkana Bohbot, has a picture of her son on display at her home in Mevaseret Zion, Israel, May 7, 2025.

We have been visiting all the communities in the Negev, assessing their current and future needs, and figuring out how BGU’s faculty, students and innovation ecosystem can help them flourish. Fifth wave universities see themselves with an additional mandate beyond research and teaching: we are committed to developing the region where we are based. We are focused on both its economic capital and its human capital.”\nTo that end, BGU will double its campus in Beer-Sheva and create new faculties and schools to meet real and anticipated growing demand for its educational opportunities.\nConstruction of BGU’s North Campus (courtesy).\nAs the beating heart of a new innovation district in Beer-Sheva, the University is already addressing a growing need for doctors and other healthcare professionals.\nBuilding on its proven paradigm-shifting medical education, Ben-Gurion University continues to set the standard for training of healthcare professionals. Medical students, paramedics, doctors, nurses, and IDF soldiers about to be deployed to the front lines, can simulate real situations and train on lifelike high-tech dummies at the state-of-the-art Field Family Medical Simulation Center.\nThe Joyce and Irving Goldman Medical School celebrated its 50th anniversary this week. And to help address the national shortage of physicians, the Sagol Medical School for International Health will be announced at the upcoming 55th annual Board of Governors meeting to be held this week. The Sagol School is a four-year medical school program taught in English open to Israelis, especially new immigrants. Sami Sagol’s generous donation will enable a revamping of the curriculum aimed at smaller classes and innovative educational technologies.\nLearn more\nThe University will also announce the Young Family School for the Human Experience at the upcoming Board. It will establish a unique program supporting humanistic education for students in the natural sciences, engineering, health sciences and management throughout Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. The program, explains School head Prof. Amit Schejter, will offer courses, support excellence in humanistic education, and encourage research into the interaction between humanism and contemporary challenges.\n“The Young Family School is a bold attempt at asking the question – what does it take to be human – and respond to it using the tools of the University – teaching, research and service to the community. More and more, we all understand that scientific knowledge is not sufficient without exposing students to humanistic values, which are articulated through the study of the humanities,” says Prof. Schejter.\nVP for Resource Development and Public Affairs Jeff Kaye was gratified that despite the challenging circumstances in Israel; board members were arriving for the meeting this week.\n“During these difficult times, our friends and partners recognize the importance of our mission and rise to the challenge. It gives us such hope and comfort to see you here with us,” he said.\nThe cornerstone for the Cyndi and Max Mintzberg Cultural and Conference Center, which will be the biggest in the Negev, will be laid at the upcoming Board meeting.

A recent survey of perceptions of the Negev’s key institutions placed Ben-Gurion University highest both in terms of its impact and in terms of the pride it instills in Negev residents.\n“We are gratified that our contribution to the Negev is recognized, but this also brings home the importance of the task ahead. We have an historic responsibility to leverage our increasing excellence in research towards rebuilding the Negev better than before,” says President Prof. Chamovitz.\nThe effort will be collaborative from beginning to end and extend far beyond the campus gates. At the heart of the initiative is the establishment of a social innovation incubator at the University, where academic knowledge can be linked to on-the-ground practice by bringing together researchers, students, and local practitioners for mutual learning and collaboration. The incubator will serve as a hub where real-world challenges from across the Negev are brought in, and interdisciplinary teams of students and researchers collaborate with stakeholders to develop innovative, actionable solutions to these challenges.\nLate afternoon crowds of students walking in Cummings Square with the Zalman Aranned Central Library in the background.

Each department at the University will contribute its unique expertise.\nThe goal is to strengthen the capabilities of local professionals while embedding the University in the region’s development process. This multi-dimensional approach will not only generate innovative ideas but will help drive sustainable, inclusive growth across the Negev.\nThe Western Negev, for example, is a vital source of food production for Israel and faces both immediate recovery needs and long-term sustainability challenges. BGU is planning to establish a research center focused on agriculture and water management in the town of Sderot.\nProf. Malul explains, “Right now, the challenge is to rehabilitate agriculture in the surrounding region. We have the capabilities – we have outstanding researchers in agriculture and water with the knowledge to contribute meaningfully. The research center will enable us to both advance our own research and significantly upgrade agriculture in the region. We can help not just its recovery but advance it far beyond where it was before.\n“We are now at the outset of what will be a long journey,” says Malul, “but the overarching idea is leverage. How we as a university can leverage the Negev’s strengths and enable it to realize its potential.”\nLearn more"}

In 2024, the numbers stood at 34% and 22%, respectively. In 2016, 43% of the people surveyed said religion was not important for them, while in 2024, that figure stood at 44%.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe proportion of US Jews who consider religion important or not important was also almost identical in both reports (55% compared to 44% in 2016 and 57% compared to 43% in 2024).\nAnother traditional indicator of religious practice among Jews also remained similar in the few years between the surveys: fasting for religious reasons.\nThe 2016 report explicitly asked respondents whether they fasted on Yom Kippur. Back then, 60% said they fasted all day, 8% said part of the day, 27% did not fast and 4% did not fast for health reasons.\nIn the 2025 report, all respondents were asked if they fasted during holy times: 62% said they did, and 38% didn’t.\nA survey of the Israel Democracy Institute conducted ahead of Yom Kippur in 2019 found similar rates: 60% planned to fast and 27% said they would not (of the remaining 12%, some planned to only drink liquids while abstaining from food – 5% – and others had not decided yet – 7%).\nHowever, in the past ten years, prayer as an individual spiritual practice has become more prevalent among Jews in Israel.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe proportion of those who pray daily registered an increase, from 21% in 2016 to 29% in 2025, while that of Israeli Jews who never pray declined from 50% to 41%.\nIsrael was the only country among the 36 where men are more likely than women to pray at least once a day (40% compared to 28%).\nAt the same time, synagogue attendance did not increase.

We are also proud Jews.”\nFor at least one of them, that may have changed.\nBen Cohen, the Ben of the pair, appeared on Tucker Carlson’s talk show this week, mostly to discuss his opposition to US involvement in the Ukraine war and the Pentagon’s sprawling budget, issues where his long-touted progressive ideals can overlap with Carlson’s far-right ones.\n00:00 / 00:00\nThen, at the end of the hour-long show, Carlson asked Cohen about his “spiritual beliefs.”\n“In terms of a spiritual belief, I mean, I don’t practice a religion,” Cohen responded. “I was born a Jew. I love Jesus Christ. I think the words that he said are wonderful, are amazing. And, you know, I’m kind of distressed that a lot of organized Christian religions are not really, I don’t know, abiding by the words of Jesus Christ.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nHe added, “I think if we could follow the words of Jesus Christ and think about the Sermon on the Mount and, you know, take his words seriously, we wouldn’t be doing the stuff we’re currently doing.”\nThe Sermon on the Mount, in the New Testament Gospel of Matthew, is a series of widely known sayings in which Jesus outlines his moral vision.\nCohen’s religious inclinations are significant because Carlson is known for inviting antisemites, including a Holocaust revisionist, onto his show in the past. They are also important because Cohen and his co-founder Jerry Greenfield publicly marshaled their Judaism in defense of their company’s 2021 boycott.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe boycott drew widespread opposition from centrist and right-leaning Jewish groups, a wave of state-level legal challenges and led to a court battle that lasted years. Cohen and Greenfield — who grew up attending Hebrew school together on Long Island — sold the company to Unilever decades ago and no longer control it, though recently Cohen was reportedly planning a buyback.\n“That we support the company’s decision is not a contradiction nor is it anti-Semitic,” the pair wrote in the Times op-ed. “In fact, we believe this act can and should be seen as advancing the concepts of justice and human rights, core tenets of Judaism.”\nLater, they added, “As Jewish supporters of the State of Israel, we fundamentally reject the notion that it is anti-Semitic to question the policies of the State of Israel.”\nThe Carlson show, posted on Monday, also raises questions about whether Cohen would still identify as a supporter of Israel. The bulk of the interview was about Ukraine and the US defense budget, but near the end, when discussing why he thinks “we’re kind of headed toward war” in Iran, Cohen brought up Israel.\n“There seems to be some kind of strange relationship between Israel and the US, where, I don’t know, Israel now has the US supplying weapons for its genocide,” Cohen said. “And what I’m told is that Israel wants some concept of greater Israel. I mean, I don’t really know much about that.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n(The term “greater Israel” has generally referred to Israeli control of territories such as the West Bank and Gaza, rather than its regional conflict with Iran.)\nIn response to a subsequent question, he said, “Right now what it means to be American is that we are the world’s largest arms exporter, we have the largest military in the world, we support the slaughter of people in Gaza, if somebody protests the slaughter of people in Gaza, we arrest them. What does our country stand for?”\nThis is not the first time this year that Cohen has accused Israel of genocide in its war against Hamas in Gaza, a charge the country strenuously rejects. In March, he said, “The US supporting this genocide is essentially trampling on the soul of America,” and added, “It’s not a war, it’s a slaughter. I don’t think there’s much difference between somebody getting killed by a bomb or getting killed by being thrown in a gas chamber.”\nIn the interview on Monday, Carlson did not address Cohen’s statements on Israel. He seconded Cohen’s praise of Jesus.\nCohen has also recently begun promoting a website to back DOGE, the Elon Musk-run operation that has rapidly slashed parts of the federal government, including large global humanitarian programs. A request for comment via that website, which Cohen touts on his X account, was not immediately returned."}

All three were taken from the Nova music festival in southern Israel during Hamas’s October 2023 invasion of Israel.\nThey were held in Gaza by Abdallah Aljamal, according to the lawsuit and the IDF. Aljamal was a writer for the Palestine Chronicle, a news outlet run by the People Media Project, a US-based, tax-exempt nonprofit that is the focus of the lawsuit.\nThe hostages were rescued after 246 days in captivity in an IDF operation in June that also extracted hostage Noa Argamani, who was held separately nearby. Aljamal, his wife Fatima and his father Ahmad Aljamal were all killed during the hostage rescue mission. The family’s children survived.\nThe lawsuit argues that the Palestine Chronicle provided Aljamal with a platform to “disseminate Hamas propaganda,” providing material support to a US-designated terrorist organization, in violation of international law.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe defendants filed to dismiss the case in March.

(Luke Tress/Times of Israel)\nThe Palestine Chronicle was reporting about US campus protests around the same time, and in August 2024, published an article about Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal urging university students to protest.\nAljamal was previously a spokesperson for the Hamas-run labor ministry in Gaza. He was open about his affiliation with the terror group, appearing publicly in Arabic media as a spokesperson and posting Hamas graphics and photos of his son wearing a Hamas headband on social media. He began writing for the Palestine Chronicle in 2019 while still serving as a spokesperson for Hamas’s labor ministry, according to the lawsuit.\nAljamal appears to have had foreknowledge of the Hamas attack. On October 7, at 5:43 a.m., immediately before the invasion, he posted a message on TikTok that said, “O God, guide us.. O God, grant us the victory that you promised.. O God, acceptance, acceptance, acceptance.. Your victory, O God,” followed by a heart emoji.\nLater in the day, Aljamal praised the attack on Facebook.\nHe began writing for the Palestine Chronicle more frequently after the attack, sometimes publishing multiple articles per day, while he was holding the Israelis hostage and communicating with the outlet’s staff in the US.\nImmediately after the hostage rescue, the Palestine Chronicle changed Aljamal’s description on its website from “correspondent” to “contributor,” then later described him as a “freelance contributor” writing on “a voluntary basis.” It also eulogized him in an article after his death, calling him a “well-known journalist murdered in Gaza,” and denied that he had been holding the hostages.\nThe hostages were aware that Aljamal was communicating with terror groups, recording footage and writing about their own captivity, the complaint said. All three were “terrorized” during their captivity, subjected to arbitrary punishment, physical threats, and physical and psychological abuse, the lawsuit said.\nThe outlet’s tax-exempt status means US taxpayers were subsidizing Hamas propaganda published to a US audience, the lawsuit argues, adding that the salary he was paid also helped him imprison the hostages."}

It is set to be discussed again in two months.\nThe Law of Return was formulated in 1950, two years after the State of Israel was established, giving every Jew from around the world the automatic right to immigrate to the Jewish State. “Every Jew has the right to come to this country as an oleh [immigrant],” it states.\nFor years, lawmakers disagreed on how to define exactly who is considered a Jew for this purpose. While Orthodox religious authorities traditionally only recognize as Jewish those who have a Jewish mother, or those who converted to Judaism in an Orthodox court, the law was expanded in 1970 to also allow any grandchild of a Jew to immigrate, even if they themselves are not Jewish. The 1970 amendment also allows for the legal immigration of non-Jewish spouses of Jews.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nA Supreme Court ruling in November 2023 added that widows of children or grandchildren of Jews are also entitled to immigrant status.\nMaoz also proposed a similar motion in 2023. The change would wreak havoc for new immigrants from Russia, where the majority of new olim have come from in recent years, of whom many are not considered Jewish according to religious law.\nThe law as it currently stands “allows it to be exploited by many who have severed all ties with the Jewish people and their traditions, and in effect empties the law of its original intention,” Maoz’s proposal states. Repealing the grandchild clause would “prevent one of the greatest absurdities in the Israeli law book — that the most explicit Jewish law gives sweeping permission for non-Jews to enter the country’s gates,” he wrote.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDebating the proposal in the Knesset, the United Torah Judaism party’s Deputy Transportation Minister Uri Maklev charged that the law currently allows for religious fraud. “There could be a person who goes to church every Sunday with his parents, who comes and says he wants to enter as a Jew.”\nCommunications Minister Shlomo Karhi (Likud) added that the purpose of the 1970 amendment was to provide a haven for anyone persecuted for being Jewish. “No one dreamed that complete gentiles would come for economic purposes, like the kind that [Yisrael Beytenu MK Avigdor] Liberman brings, who receive a package of benefits and then return home after two days.”\nYisrael Beytenu party chair Avigdor Liberman leads a faction meeting at the Knesset in Jerusalem, on December 16, 2024 (Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)\nLiberman shot back, arguing that real Jews serve in the IDF, unlike many in the ultra-Orthodox community.\n“7,000 soldiers whose father or grandfather were Jewish stood up for the country, fighting and defending us, and dozens of them fell in the Iron Swords War,” he wrote on X, using the IDF’s official name for the current war. “In their actions, they proved that they are much more Jewish than any draft-evader who harms Israel’s security.”\nDemocrats MK Gilad Kariv accusing Karhi of being a “racist,” posting on X that “the contribution of 1.2 million Russian-speaking Israelis to Israel’s society, to national security, and to Judaism is priceless. It is dozens of times greater than the contribution of this group of hatred, division and incitement, of which Karhi is one of the leaders.”\nYesh Atid MK Vladimir Beliak, a Russian-born immigrant, also responded harshly.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Forty immigrant soldiers from the former Soviet Union were killed in the war, and over 400 were injured,” he wrote on X. “At least 18 immigrant citizens were killed, and five were kidnapped in Gaza. The Hamas terrorists did not ask under which article they immigrated to Israel. None of this prevents Karhi from slandering the immigrant community.”\nMost coalition parties are expected to vote in favor of rescinding the grandchild clause when it is brought back for debate in two months, according to a report by the public broadcaster Kan. The only obstacle to the legislation is a coalition agreement that gives veto power to Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar and his New Hope party. However, Sa’ar’s party is on the verge of merging with Likud, at which point he will lose that veto power, the report said."}

The killing drew widespread condemnation around the world, with Israel, under heavy US pressure to investigate, eventually concluding that a single soldier shot her by mistake.\nAccording to the documentary by Zeteo News, a left-wing news outlet founded by Israel critic Mehdi Hassan, Cpt. Alon Scagio, then a 20-year-old sharpshooter in the Duvdevan commando unit, was behind the deadly shooting. Scagio was killed by a roadside bomb in Jenin last year at the age of 22. (The Israel Defense Forces had previously spelled his name as Sacgiu).\nFollowing the killing of Abu Akleh, the IDF initially blamed Palestinian gunmen but later acknowledged that she could have also been killed by Israeli soldiers.\nIn September 2022, the IDF concluded “with very high likelihood” that a single soldier shot the journalist after “misidentifying her.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“He misidentified her.

However, the IDF itself told the newspaper that there was “no definitive determination regarding the identity of the individual responsible for the shooting.” The army also passed along a message from the Scagio family requesting that reporters not name the captain.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBecause the IDF found the shooting had been accidental, no prosecution was ever opened and the shooter was not named publicly. A US State Department probe also found that while Abu Akleh was likely shot by an Israeli soldier, the killing was seemingly unintentional.\nHowever, the documentary, titled “Who Killed Shireen,” cited an anonymous official in former US president Joe Biden’s administration who says a draft version of the American report concluded that she was shot intentionally, but the finding was softened to avoid friction with Israel.\nAn unnamed US official quoted by The New York Times denied that the report had been altered and said US officials were not able to determine what the shooter may have seen or what his motivations may have been.\nSeveral independent media investigations have previously said there were no armed Palestinians in the vicinity of Abu Akleh and other journalists she was with when they came under gunfire, which also wounded another reporter.\nAbu Akleh’s brother, Anton Abu Akleh, told Al Jazeera he was confident the documentary “will shed more light and prove that she was systematically targeted like other journalists in Palestine by the Israeli army.”\nPeople carry the coffin of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in Jerusalem, May 13, 2022.

But along with the National Endowment for the Humanities, which supports research in the humanities, it has long been a target for conservatives who believe the government should not support arts endeavors, particularly ones that they say advance progressive values. The Trump administration, which has taken a slash-and-burn approach to spending and sought to cut off many recipients of federal funding for ideological reasons, on Friday proposed eliminating the National Endowment of the Arts entirely.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“The NEA is updating its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation’s rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the President,” an email from the NEA to at least some grant recipients sent Friday night after the budget proposal. “Consequently, we are terminating awards that fall outside these new priorities.”\nThe rescissions leave Jewish and other groups uncertain about how they will cover their expenses. Some have already budgeted for or even spent the latest grants, anticipating receiving the awards they had been promised.\nWinitsky said he saw the cuts as a direct attack on groups that might undercut the administration.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“This is enormously concerning,” he said. “It may feel like a small amount of money — $207 million for the United States government is a tiny amount of money, and it is one of many chaotic policies that are being rolled out right now. But it is well proven over human history that when powerful people try to control the message of arts and culture, what they are trying to do is control people.”\nThe Jewish Plays Project was initially awarded $20,000 from the NEA, which, in addition to other grants and donations, covers things like artist fees and pay for actors, directors and stage managers, for people working on several plays across the country. All of that federal grant money is now gone, said Winitsky, who is hoping local governments can help fill the gap.\nExterior of the Jewish Museum in New York City, June 13, 2019. (Ajay Suresh/ CC BY 2.0/ Wikimedia commons)\n“It remains to be seen whether we get funding from New York City and New York State,” Winitsky said. “I don’t think it will affect this year, but will those organizations either offer direct funding or step in, or maybe even have to supplement their own budgets, from the state or local level to supplement federal funding that’s gone? We don’t know yet.”\nOther New York Jewish organizations and institutions that receive NEA funding include the Jewish Museum, which was set to receive $50,000 to fund its current exhibit, “Queen Esther in the Age of Rembrandt.” Reached Monday afternoon, a representative from the Jewish Museum could not confirm whether the grant had been revoked.\nThe rescissions come as the Trump administration advances an agenda focused in part on what it says are efforts to fight antisemitism. The NEA email received by grantees said the administration would continue to support “projects that elevate the Nation’s HBCUs and Hispanic Serving Institutions, celebrate the 250th anniversary of American independence, foster AI competency, empower houses of worship to serve communities, assist with disaster recovery, foster skilled trade jobs, make America healthy again, support the military and veterans, support Tribal communities, make the District of Columbia safe and beautiful, and support the economic development of Asian American communities.”\nAnything else would be cut off, the email said, adding that grantees could appeal within seven days “if [they] believe [their] project meets one of the agency’s new priorities.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nWinitsky said he thinks the Jewish Plays Project will appeal the decision. But he said the new funding priorities set forth in the email were confusing and “don’t really add up to a cohesive strategy at all,” and he emphasized that his initiative would not be swayed in its mission.\n“If somebody asks us to change what we are doing to meet somebody else’s priorities or somebody else’s vision, we’re not going to do that,” Winitsky said.\nFor Yugntruf, the initial $10,000 grant marked the first government funding received for its work. The grant was intended to support the publication of “Hanka: The Ghetto Queen Sings at Night,” a bilingual English-Yiddish edition of Jacob Pat’s children’s book “Haneke,” the true story of a teenager imprisoned in the Bialystok Ghetto during the Holocaust who became the youngest member of the city’s underground resistance movement.\nThe grant was meant to go to various freelancers in support of production costs for the book’s layout and design, archival research, a cartographer and editing. Jacob Pat’s great-granddaughter, Anita Galler, is the English translator.\n“It’ll be harder, but we’ll publish it,” said Jordan Kutzik, Yugntruf’s chair. “We’ll make up the money. We’re in a better position than a lot of other organizations who’ve had this funding cut.”\nKutzik said he did not see the NEA grants as “targeting any particular demographic” but said they did not make sense to him.\n“It’s odd to see them saying a Yiddish-English children’s book about the Holocaust doesn’t reflect the American artistic culture,” he said. “The Holocaust is part of the American story, because a million Americans are descendants of Holocaust survivors. The author we’re publishing was a refugee from the Holocaust who wrote this book for an American audience.”\nAdditionally, funding for the City Parks Foundation, which operates SummerStage, the annual public summer festival held in Central Park that features a lineup of Yiddish music, was rescinded. This year’s “New York Sings Yiddish” show, scheduled for June 30, includes performances from conductor and artistic director of the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene Zalmen Mlotek and Frank London’s Klezmer All Stars. The City Parks Foundation did not respond to a request for comment about the potential impact on the concert series."}

That is because more than 70% of Israel’s electricity is generated from domestic natural gas production. Gradus urged the government to revise its current policy for retaining natural gas for domestic use so as to ensure the country’s energy independence for the coming decades.\nIn the position paper sent to Israel’s Energy Ministry and other ministries, Gradus called on the government to update the current quantity of 440 billion cubic meters of natural gas reserved for domestic use to 515 BCM for Israel to meet the growing domestic energy needs of households and businesses in the next 25 years.\nThe Treasury argued that since the last update on the gas reserve policy for domestic use, the deployment of renewable energy in the country has been slower than expected, and the infrastructure for storage of natural gas has not been established, while gas export sales are continuing to rise.\nSign up for the Tech Israel Daily\nand never miss Israel's top tech stories\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nIsrael was supposed to generate 10% of its energy from renewables by 2020, but only reached 9.2% at the end of 2022. If current trends continue, only 19% of energy would be generated by renewable sources by the end of the decade, compared with an official goal of 30%.\nTamar natural gas field off the coast of Israel. (Courtesy)\nSince Israel first discovered large natural gas fields off its Mediterranean coast more than a decade ago, the country has emerged as a gas exporter. Its natural gas operations have put it on a path to energy independence — and have shielded it from the worst of the energy crisis sparked by the Russian war on Ukraine this year — in a region with few natural resources.\nThe Leviathan natural gas field, the nation’s largest, started pumping on December 31, 2019, after natural gas started to flow in 2013 at the nearby Tamar, the second largest field. Tamar holds some 10 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of natural gas, half of the quantity held in Leviathan.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsrael has been exporting gas from the Tamar field to Jordan since January 2017, and the Leviathan field started exports to Egypt in January 2020. The Leviathan deals are considered to be bigger and more significant for the economy.\nAmid the ongoing war with the Hamas terror group in Gaza, natural gas exports to Egypt and Jordan increased by more than 13% in 2024 year-on-year. Overall, natural gas production was up 8.3% in 2024, and state revenue collected from gas royalties soared almost 11% to NIS 2.37 billion ($670 million).\nIn June 2022, Israel, Egypt and the European Union signed a memorandum of understanding that will see Israel export its natural gas to the bloc for the first time. According to the agreement, Israeli gas will be supplied via Egypt’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants to the European Union.\nIn the report, the finance ministry’s budget department also warned about the high concentration in the local gas market, citing the cross-ownership of US energy giant Chevron in Israel’s largest gas reservoirs. Chevron operates and holds a 25% stake in the Tamar gas field, and a 39.66% stake in the Leviathan gas reservoir.\nWorkers on the Israeli ‘Tamar’ gas processing rig, 24 km off the Israeli southern coast of Ashkelon. (Moshe Shai/FLASH90)\n“This concentration poses a risk to price levels, energy security and the long-term competitiveness of the economy,” according to the position paper. “Putting the operations of essential gas infrastructure in the hands of a single entity, without a substantial competitive alternative, creates a captive market in which consumers have no real ability to negotiate or secure fair prices over time.”\n“This concentration could lead in the near term to an increase in gas prices and, as a result, lead to higher electricity prices,” it added.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn the position paper, the ministry called on the government to take structural steps to reduce concentration in the domestic gas market.\nOne of the recommendations is to consider, from 2030, limiting holdings to no more than one rig that produces gas in Israel, if these holdings constitute more than 80% of the gas reserves in the economy.\nIn response, the Energy Ministry said that it seeks to “secure the supply of natural gas to the economy at the lowest price, and the right way to do this is through the discovery of additional reserves, the entry of new international companies, and creating competition.”\n“We are closely monitoring natural gas prices in the Israeli economy and we will use all the tools at our disposal to secure price levels without being dragged into the misguided steps put forward by the Finance Ministry, that will drive away international companies, prevent the discovery of new reserves and result in price increases,” the Energy Ministry said. “Unfortunately, the position paper is not in line with reality and does not take into account recently signed contracts.”\n“Similarly, predictions about an expected shortage of natural gas are unfounded and create unnecessary panic,” the ministry said."}

She called the allegations “profoundly disturbing” and said that, if proven true, the claims would violate the federal Fair Housing Act.\n“Discrimination on the basis of religion, race, national origin, or other protected characteristics — whether explicit or cloaked in pretext — is not only illegal but fundamentally un-American,” she wrote in a letter on Monday that backed a federal statement of interest in the case, one of several similar disputes in the tri-state area.\nThe defendants’ legal team responded in a letter to James’s office, saying that the town agreed with James’s support for religious liberty and housing non-discrimination, but that her characterization of the case was “inaccurate or incomplete.”\nThe dispute stems from a 2022 civil lawsuit filed in the federal Southern District of New York court against the town of Forestburgh, its zoning board, and several town officials. The plaintiffs are Lost Lake Holdings and Mishconos Mazah, companies owned by Hasidic Jews.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe two companies said they had bought land for a development in 2020. The previous owner, who was not Jewish, had obtained approval to build more than 2,600 residential units at the 3.3-square-mile site. The town board had described that development as a “wonderful project” and local residents backed the non-Jewish company, the lawsuit said. The rural town has a population of around 900.\nThe company failed to carry out the construction project, and the two Jewish companies bought the site. After local officials realized Hasidic Jews had acquired the land for development, the town set up a series of obstructions to prevent construction. Local officials and inspectors denied building permit applications, conducted an illegal search of the property, over-assessed the value of the site to drive up taxes, issued stop-work orders, and adopted a local law that imposed a 1,000% increase in fees, among other measures, the lawsuit alleged.\nIllustrative: This picture taken on April 5, 2019 shows shows two Jewish men hitchhiking during a rainfall in a Jewish neighborhood of Monsey in Rockland County, New York. (Johannes Eisele/AFP)\nInternal emails cited by James and federal officials suggested anti-Jewish discrimination played into the obstruction.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Don’t be scared about the Hasidic threat — we’re energized and have the cash to fight and make their lives miserable,” a local official said in an email, according to the federal attorneys.\n“Bloomingberg was asleep: we’re on amphetamines,” the email said, in an apparent reference to disputes between local officials and the Hasidic community in the nearby town of Bloomingburg.\nIn another email, a local resident wrote to town officials, “Their sect is notorious for mysogyny and child abuse,” and warned of “their wanton destruction of the towns and school districts.”\n“They take over, like locusts — killing everything they encounter, draining every last resource,” the email said. The town board planning chair forwarded the email to unknown recipients, saying, “I too have been thinking strategy about how to prevent Lost Lake from overwhelming this town,” according to the federal statement.\nTown officials were pushed by local residents who opposed the development, the plaintiffs said. Local social media groups and articles about the development were flooded with antisemitic comments. In some of the online comments cited by the lawsuit, area residents decried “dirty money” from the “Jewish mafia,” and said, “You wonder why Germans did what they say they did.”\nThe defendants’ lawyers responded to James in a Wednesday letter that a town official shared with The Times of Israel.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA local zoning law that James has said may illegally discriminate against religious land use had been misinterpreted, the town said. Places of worship are permitted throughout the town, subject to restrictions similar to those applied to non-religious buildings, in rules that are more permissive than in other local communities, the letter said.\nThe email about the “Hasidic threat” was from 2015, written by someone who was a private citizen at the time, and related to a fraud case in Bloomingburg, the letter said.\n“The Town categorically denies that any of its land use actions were based on the religious identity of the developer or potential homebuyers,” the town said.\nThe back-and-forth this week was the second exchange between the town and the attorney general’s office. Last year, James’s office warned the town that the rezoning ordinance “discriminates against Jewish New Yorkers” by illegally limiting religious land use. The town’s lawyers said that interpretation of the law appeared “to be based on a selective or incorrect factual record,” pointing to similar zoning rules for other buildings. The rules were put in place to keep development at a low density “to preserve the rural character of the Town,” the letter said.\nThe defendants have also disputed that the companies, and the property’s previous owner, had approval to build a large housing development. The development plans were “inconsistent with and materially different” from previous approvals, a town official said in a legal filing.\nThe thwarted plans have caused the developers significant financial damage and effectively stripped them of the property. The lawsuit seeks compensation, declarations of wrongdoing and to overturn the obstructions.\nThe US government weighed in on the case in March because of its interest in enforcing federal law, and because of US President Donald Trump’s January 2025 executive order on combating antisemitism, the Department of Justice said. The department also weighed in on the case in 2023.\nJames’s Monday letter supported the federal intervention, saying, “Your engagement in this matter sends a powerful message that no individual or community is above the law — and no community is beyond its protection.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Together, we must affirm the principle that government decisions must be based on law and evidence — not bias, fear, or bigotry,” James said, according to a copy of the letter James’s office shared with The Times of Israel.\nForestburgh is located in Sullivan County in the Catskills region, around a two-hour drive northwest of Manhattan.\nThe Satmar Hasidic village of Kiryas Joel. (JTA/Uriel Heilman)\nThe lawsuit illustrated ongoing disputes between Jewish and non-Jewish residents in areas surrounding New York City, as Jews move out of the city due to housing pressure. The disputes have exposed alleged antisemitism that takes place in quiet small town bureaucracy, away from the widely publicized discrimination occurring in forums like street protests and on college campuses, and unconnected to the Gaza war. The opposition is motivated by both generic resistance to community change and development, and anti-Jewish animus.\nThe Catskills region has a celebrated Jewish history stretching back more than a century. The so-called “Borscht Belt” drew throngs of Jewish visitors to the Catskills in the mid-1900s and has had a lasting impact on American culture, particularly in stand-up comedy. The Borscht Belt declined as antisemitism waned and Jewish tourists traveled elsewhere, contributing to an economic downturn in the region. Jews have launched efforts to revive the memory of the Borscht Belt in recent years with comedy shows, a museum and public placards.\nJewish camps and getaways are scattered across the region, many Jews have summer homes in the area, and there are several recently built Orthodox Jewish developments in the areas around Forestburgh.\nDespite warm memories of the Borscht Belt, a series of fires at the former hotels has given rise to antisemitic conspiracies.\nIn 1974, Hasidic Jews established the town of Kiryas Joel in Orange County, bordering Sullivan County. Hasidic expansion in that town and others in the area has sparked repeated disputes between Jewish and non-Jewish residents. In the small towns, growing Hasidic communities can fundamentally change the composition of the local population, leading to conflicts over control of local government and schools.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn addition to referring to Bloominburg, opponents of the development in Forestburgh repeatedly mentioned Kiryas Joel, according to the lawsuit. A town fire department official told the plaintiffs that residents feared the Hasidic “bloc vote,” comparing the situation to Kiryas Joel. Local reports about the development also drew comparisons, with comments warning of “Kiryas Joel part 2” and calling that community dirty, the lawsuit said.\nJames’s letter acknowledged that pattern, saying Orthodox Jews “too often faced bias masked as bureaucratic decision-making in matters of zoning, housing, and land use.”\nUsing zoning laws and land use regulations against Jews “recalls a dark history” that appears to be “reemerging in the 21st century,” James said.\nNew Jersey has seen similar conflicts, with local governments feuding with Jews over schools, zoning laws and a cemetery, including in recent weeks."}

The revelations sparked criticism of the prize committee from Israel’s Foreign Ministry and a call for the prize to be rescinded.\n00:00 / 23:33\n“These are not word games – they are outright denials of documented atrocities,” Damari wrote in a letter to the prize board posted on X Thursday. “You claim to honor journalism that upholds truth, democracy, and human dignity.

Fanny shared these heartbreaking details with Infobae, a news portal in Argentina.\nThe last image captured of Matías before his capture by Hamas was a poignant moment preserved on an unknown individual’s cell phone camera.

Kosher, the most recognizable kosher certifier in the United States.\nThe callers were all anxious about the potential implications of the policy change on the kosher status of milk. Since 1954, most kosher-keeping American Jews have relied on an influential rabbi’s determination that government oversight of milk production is sufficient to render commercially produced milk kosher.\nThe rabbi, Moshe Feinstein, was dealing with an age-old problem of Jewish law when he made his ruling.\nAccording to halacha, or traditional Jewish law, milk is only kosher if it comes from a kosher animal. One way to ensure that is the case is to consume only milk produced in a facility where Jews oversee every step of the process — relatively easy to accomplish in the pre-modern world, but less practical in the contemporary United States.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nFeinstein — considered one of the most important Jewish legal authorities of the 20th century — addressed the challenge by ruling that government regulations could effectively take the place of some aspects of Jewish supervision. Because the US government both requires that only cow’s milk be called milk, and because inspectors are regularly dispatched to milk production facilities to ensure that all legal requirements are upheld, Jews could assume that commercial milk does not contain milk from non-kosher animals, Feinstein concluded.\nHis opinion was so decisive and pivotal that the Orthodox Union cites it on its landing page for queries about milk. But what happens if the federal government overhauls or abandons its oversight of milk?\nNothing, at least for now. That’s what Gordimer and his team have concluded after seeking to understand just what has changed at the FDA.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“This development has no impact whatsoever on the kosher status of ‘chalav stam’ [regular commercial milk] that Rabbi Feinstein permitted in the US, as the primary oversight of farms and dairy factories is performed by state governments; the FDA is a mere secondary body for this purpose,” he said by email.\nWhat’s more, Gordimer said, the testing that Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended is meant only to detect certain contaminants and prohibited additives. Physical inspections, which he said are continuing uninterrupted, are different, and key to Feinstein’s ruling.\n“There has been no change in inspections, which are ongoing,” Gordimer said.\nIllustrative: US President Donald Trump speaks to the press after signing an executive order, alongside US Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (L) and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick (R), at the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, on February 25, 2025. (Jim Watson/AFP)\nPlus, the law prohibiting anything other than cow’s milk from being sold as “milk” remains on the books.\nStill, the reports about changes have prompted concerns from kosher consumers. “Are we seeing the first step in the end of chalav stam…” one person asked in the Facebook group Great Kosher Restaurant Foodies.\nSome Jews have rejected Feinstein’s opinion and instead limited their consumption to cholov yisroel milk, which is overseen by Jews throughout the production process. But it tends to be harder to find and more expensive.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA kosher-keeping critic of US President Donald Trump tweeted about the regulatory changes, “If I have to go cholov yisroel because of Tronald Dump my head might explode.”\nEven as OU Kosher — as well as health experts — says the current changes are no cause for concern, the scaling back of milk testing offers an early sign that kosher supervisors will need to pay attention to sweeping changes underway under the Trump administration. Kennedy has broad and unorthodox views on a number of topics and has promised to shake up everything from fluoridation in water to vaccines to food additives.\nThis week, he announced plans to ban synthetic food dyes. Mounting concerns about synthetic dyes, which are widely used in commercial food production, have caused producers to turn to natural alternatives — such as cochineal extract, a derivative from parasitic bugs that is a powerful substitute for red dyes.\nWorkers pour harvested female insects known as Dactylopius coccus onto a sifter to make cochineal dye, or carmine, east of Mexico City, August 24, 2023. (AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo)\nCochineal extract, called carmine, is not kosher, meaning that kosher supervisors may need to retract certification of some items if their producers opt to replace synthetic reds with it. That happened with some forms of Tums, the heartburn relief medication, in recent years, according to a 2021 alert from the Chicago Rabbinical Council, which like the OU certifies products and offers guidance to kosher consumers.\nBut it’s also possible that producers will keep kosher-keeping customers in mind as they adjust to Kennedy’s decrees. Paulaur, which produces sprinkles and other food toppings, recently dropped its use of Red 3, a synthetic dye, the Wall Street Journal reported last month — but turned to beetroot juice and purple sweet potatoes as coloring agents so it could continue to sell kosher products."}

Healy wrote that the Times seeks to avoid Nazi references in the essays it publishes, but felt David’s piece “is not equating Trump with Hitler. It is about seeing someone for who they really are and not losing sight of that.”\nDavid joined other critics of Maher’s conciliatory description of his Trump meeting. “Bill is just the latest in a whole series of people who get had by the personal charm, if you will, of some really bad people,” said Democratic strategist James Carville on his “Politics War Room” podcast.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn a segment on “Real Time,” Washington Post global security analyst Josh Rogin told Maher he was a “prop” in Trump’s “PR stunt.”\nIn the David piece, the narrator banters amiably with Hitler, who laughs at his jokes. “I realized I’d never seen him laugh before,” he writes. “Suddenly he seemed so human.”\nMaher said something similar about Trump in his monologue: “Just for starters, he laughs! I’ve never seen him laugh in public. But he does, including at himself. And it’s not fake.”\nIn his editor’s note, Healy writes that “David, in a provocation of his own, is arguing that during a single dinner or a private meeting, anyone can be human, and it means nothing in the end about what they’re capable of.”\nA history of satirical Holocaust references\nDavid, who skewered conservative policies on his long-running HBO show, has often used Nazi references in his satire. As a standup comedian, he would goad audiences by saying “The one thing about Hitler that I admire…” before suggesting that the dictator had no patience for stage magicians.\nHe and Jerry Seinfeld created the “Soup Nazi” character on “Seinfeld,” and “Curb” featured a memorable clash between a Holocaust survivor and a contestant on the reality show “Survivor” who too considered himself a victim.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSuch jokes have divided audiences, and even individual critics. In an essay criticizing David for a Holocaust joke he told while hosting “Saturday Night Live” in 2017, Jeremy Dauber praised the “Survivor” episode on “Curb.”\n“In that ‘Curb’ episode,” writes Dauber, a professor of Jewish literature at Columbia University, “David is searchingly moral, flaying a kind of ethical vacuity and historical relativism about the Holocaust.”\nDavid’s piece is also reminiscent of a 2003 skit by the Jewish comedian Jon Stewart, who imagines Hitler being interviewed by the late Larry King, the ingratiating CNN talk show host.\nIn his Max monologue, Maher, who positions himself as a centrist truth-teller between political extremes, anticipates the blowback he was sure to receive as a result of his dinner with a deeply polarizing president. “You can hate me for it, but I’m not a liar. Trump was gracious and measured, and why he isn’t that in other settings, I don’t know,” he said."}

He was also inspired by the stories of his grandfathers, who both served in World War II.\nPart of the “unconscious” impetus behind History By Mail, Siegel said, was the way Jewish learning centered on the study of primary sources, such as the Torah and Talmud.\n“We are used to, in a Jewish context, learning from primary sources, but out there in the world, people don’t typically learn that way, and so it’s sort of bringing a Jewish style of learning to the general public,” said Siegel.\nHe began sending replicas of historical documents to friends and family, and from there he launched his business in 2019.\nSiegel said his great-great-grandfather immigrated to America in 1881 and started a watchmaking business and jewelry store and passed down his entrepreneurial spirit.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“There’s something in the Jewish culture or DNA that is very much about entrepreneurship,” said Siegel.\nIn his “Shark Tank” pitch, Siegel presented each judge — known in the show’s parlance as a Shark — with an edition of History By Mail.\nTwo Jewish Sharks took a pass on Siegel’s pitch: Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks minority owner whose edition focused on the history of basketball, and Lori Greiner, the TV personality who got a version about Annie Oakley.\nDallas Mavericks team owner Mark Cuban walks to his seat during the first half of an NBA basketball game against the Houston Rockets in Dallas, November 28, 2023.

As he prepared for his episode, Siegel said he successfully pushed back on the studio when they initially scheduled his taping for Shabbat.\nSiegel and Lubetzky finalized their business deal this year on the Jewish holiday of Tu Bishvat, and Siegel said he put out KIND Bars for his guests as an homage to his new business partner.\n“He made his fortune on fruits and nuts, and this is the holiday of fruits and nuts, and it just like happened to be that I came to the terms of the deal with him on that day, which was amazing,” said Siegel."}

(Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nMeanwhile, UTJ lawmaker Yaakov Asher warned, in a Monday interview with the Haredi news site Kikar HaShabbat, that if the Knesset did not pass draft exemption legislation by the end of the summer session, July 27, his party would no longer be able to remain in the government.\n“If this law does not pass in this session… we will have a very big problem sitting in such a government, period,” he said, adding that UTJ “cannot be part of a government” that turns Haredim into “criminals.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThings escalated even further the next day, with the military announcing on Tuesday evening that Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir had ordered the IDF Personnel Directorate to immediately provide a plan to “expand and maximize” the number of draft orders sent to young ultra-Orthodox men — enraging the Haredi community.\nIn response, Netanyahu on Wednesday invited Shas chairman Deri, Defense Minister Israel Katz and Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee chairman Yuli Edelstein to a last-ditch meeting in an attempt to arrive at a compromise regarding the long-delayed bill regulating Haredi military enlistment.\nEdelstein, a member of Netanyahu’s ruling Likud party, has long blocked the advancement of the exemption legislation through his committee, pledging that any law on the issue of Haredi service would “significantly increase the IDF’s conscription base.”\nEdelstein had announced on Tuesday that after exhaustive debate, his committee was “one step away” from drafting a new version of the law — raising Haredi concerns that he would advance a version mandating harsh sanctions on draft evaders.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz (left) shakes hands with Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chairman Yuli Edelstein during a committee discussion on the IDF conscription law in the Knesset on January 21, 2025. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nThe Prime Minister’s Office attempted to present Wednesday evening’s meeting in a positive light, releasing a statement claiming that “progress was noted at the meeting, and it was agreed that the discussions will continue in an attempt to bridge the gaps.”\nHowever, leaks from the meeting published in the Hebrew press paint a different picture. Channel 12’s Amit Segal tweeted that “a furious Netanyahu threatened the ultra-Orthodox parties in his coalition that he’ll go to elections,” and national broadcaster Kan reported that Deri rejected Edelstein’s proposal that the IDF begin by conscripting half of each year’s annual ultra-Orthodox draft cohort.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to Kan, United Torah Judaism chairman Yitzchak Goldknopf, a major stakeholder, was not even invited because the other participants believed he would reject any compromise raised during the meeting.\nFollowing the meeting, a UTJ party source launched a scathing attack on Netanyahu, telling ultra-Orthodox news site Behadrei Haredim that the premier had “forgotten that he signed [in his coalition agreements] with United Torah Judaism and Shas that the conscription law would be enacted immediately upon the formation of the government.”\nThe Haredim, the source added, “do not want discussions and do not want progress,” but rather the immediate passage of a law — something that has become increasingly difficult politically due to widespread public opposition to Haredi military exemptions, including within the coalition itself.\n“As soon as the ultra-Orthodox parties realize that Netanyahu cannot muster a majority [to pass] the conscription law [with provisions maintaining the Haredi exemption from service], they will leave the government,” Avi Mimran, a broadcaster with the ultra-Orthodox radio station Kol Hai, told The Times of Israel on Wednesday. “After two years of waiting, the final deadline has arrived.”\nHousing and Construction Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf speaks at a faction meeting for his ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party on March 3, 2025. (Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)\nCohen was slightly less certain, noting that if the ultra-Orthodox parties “had better alternatives” to the Netanyahu coalition, they would probably have bolted already.\n“Will they bring down the government, or will they withdraw from the coalition and support it from outside? I don’t know what to tell you, and anything can happen,” including an ongoing boycott of all coalition legislation, he said.\nHowever, if the army sends out 60,000 enlistment orders to Haredi yeshiva students — as IDF chief Zamir appears to be demanding — and then begins actively arresting those who refuse to serve, Cohen believes that the Haredim would “leave the coalition in a second,” with Shas following United Torah Judaism’s lead.\nKan reported that during Wednesday evening’s meeting, Defense Minister Katz promised not to engage in any enforcement against those ignoring the new enlistment orders demanded by Zamir.\nADVERTISEMENT\nUTJ’s exit would not topple the government, but it would leave it with a bare 61-59 seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset.

Now, he said, it has dropped to 75–85%.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe drop could be caused by long-term damage to soldiers’ careers and finances, harm to their families and social lives, anger over inequality in the burden of service, and a general decline in motivation due to the unusually prolonged nature of the war, he explained.\nYet the decrease could also be attributed to a deterioration in mental resilience among soldiers who developed multiple symptoms of PTSD as a result of their service.\nRise of symptoms\nThe researchers tracked 579 soldiers who enlisted in one of the IDF’s infantry brigades, at five different times since their initial recruitment in March 2019.\nThe soldiers completed a questionnaire developed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs, translated into Hebrew, considered the gold standard for self-reported PTSD symptom assessment. In the questionnaire, participants rated the severity of their symptoms.\nThe results of the questionnaire do not replace a formal diagnosis in a structured clinical interview, Bar-Haim said. However, many studies from Israel and abroad point to a strong correlation between the self-reported screening tool and the results of clinical interviews.\nThe findings showed that as the duration of military service increased, so did the percentage of soldiers reporting multiple PTSD symptoms at severity levels consistent with a clinical diagnosis according to the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition).\nADVERTISEMENT\nAt the time of their enlistment, less than 0.5% of recruits suffered from preexisting PTSD. After 15 months in the army, including six months of combat training and about nine months of operational activity, the number rose to 2.6%.\nToward the end of mandatory service, after several additional rounds of operational activity, it rose to 4.4%.\nIDF soldiers standing atop a battle tank as part of the Givati Brigade operating in eastern Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, in a handout picture released on May 10, 2024. (Israel Defense Forces/AFP)\nAlthough there had been hope that symptoms would subside after the soldiers’ discharge, there was actually another increase six months later, with nearly 8% of the soldiers reporting multiple PTSD symptoms.\nBar-Haim said the reasons were unclear, but “the military framework provides support and a sense of belonging, which fades after discharge when each soldier returns home and resumes civilian life.”\nThe final assessment was made a few months after the outbreak of the current war.\n“As expected, the war deepened psychological difficulties,” Bar-Haim said, “with the number of soldiers reporting post-traumatic symptoms rising to about 12%.”\nThe data from the study aligns with the number of discharged combat soldiers who are turning to the Defense Ministry’s rehabilitation department for help and recognition of their condition, Bar-Haim said.\nDavid Moshe of the Chayal’s Angels doing cranial sacral therapy on an IDF soldier, December 17, 2023. (Courtesy)\nHe said the numbers partially explain the decline in reserves duty participation rates. Reserves soldiers experiencing multiple symptoms find it difficult to show up for additional service. In June 2024, Bar-Haim urged the army to exempt reservists with PTSD from additional military service until their treatment has been completed.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe IDF is taking many steps to prevent and treat PTSD, he added, putting immense strain on the army, the Defense Ministry, the Rehabilitation Department, and Israeli society as a whole.\n“But the main burden is on the combat soldiers and their families,” Bar-Haim said."}

Individuals found to be in violation of University Rules and policies will face disciplinary consequences,” the statement said.\nDuring the standoff between the protesters and campus security, other activists attempted to force their way into the building, injuring two university safety officers, acting Columbia President Claire Shipman said in a statement. One of the officers was removed on a gurney and another required bandages.\nBREAKING ????: Protesters are assaulting and trying to trample Public Safety officers outside of Butler Library @Columbia.

The NYPD spokesperson did not yet have information on charges.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNew York leaders condemned the demonstration, while backing the right to peaceful protest.\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams voiced support for Jewish New Yorkers.\n“To parents of students protesting: call your children and make clear that breaking the law is wrong,” Adams added. “We will not tolerate hate or violence.”\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, “We are reviewing the visa status of the trespassers and vandals who took over Columbia University’s library.”\n“Pro-Hamas thugs are no longer welcome in our great nation,” Rubio said on X.\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul said in a statement, “Everyone has the right to peacefully protest. But violence, vandalism or destruction of property are completely unacceptable.”\nThe university’s response was a stark contrast to last year, when protesters set up an unauthorized encampment on the university lawn. The administration at the time negotiated with the demonstrators, and only called in police weeks later after the protesters smashed their way into a campus building.\nJewish students and faculty voiced support for the university’s response.\n“Strong words and action from Columbia,” Brian Cohen, the head of Columbia’s Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, said on X. “I appreciate all that President Shipman and the Public Safety team did to restore order at Butler Library.”\nWednesday’s takeover occurred during days set aside for studying ahead of the university’s final exams next week.\nThe university commencement is scheduled for May 21. Last year’s commencement was canceled due to protests."}

A February report by the Community Security Trust (CST), a nonprofit that monitors antisemitism and provides security for UK Jews, reported 3,528 antisemitic incidents in 2024, a figure that is second only to the 4,296 incidents recorded the year before. A separate study by UK-based Campaign Against Antisemitism found that only one-third of British Jews believe they have a long-term future in the United Kingdom, and half have considered leaving Britain in the past two years due to antisemitism.\nThe report by the UK arm of StandWithUs, an international Israel-education organization, included findings from an April 2024 survey of more than 1,000 non-Jewish students across 20 universities. It found that 64% of students were unwilling to call the October 7 attack “terrorism,” and 29% said they believed it was an “understandable act of resistance.” Meanwhile, 38% of students agreed that students who publicly support Israel should “expect” abuse on campus, while just 31% clearly rejected that notion.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“[This report] is littered with examples of loud and virulent support for Hamas and Hezbollah,” noted Lord John Cryer during the public debate. “These are both proscribed as terrorist organizations, and expressing support for proscribed organizations should be met with the full force of the law.”\nThe report documented numerous incidents of harassment, intimidation, and physical threats.\nProtesters attend a march against antisemitism in London, England, December 8, 2024. (Campaign Against Antisemitism)\nA student at King’s College described how he was nearly assaulted as an event focused on dialogue and understanding was shut down by anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian students who stormed the space. “Campus security later told me it was the worst violence they had seen since the encampments last year,” the student said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA student at the University of Manchester said he spoke out after he saw other students celebrating the October 7 attacks on social media. “They responded by taking screenshots of my message and posting my full name, Instagram handle, and even my address online,” he testified. “What followed was terrifying: I received hundreds of messages, many of them threatening and abusive. I was harassed, doxxed, and publicly vilified simply for speaking out.”\nOther students said they were told, “Your people should not be alive,” and that “There is no space for Zionists on campus, not now, not ever.” One recalled how they were shouted at simply for walking past the library, while another said she needed her brother to escort her to class for fear of being attacked.\nMembers of the House of Lords expressed shock at the report’s findings.\n“Let me be clear: Denying Jewish students the right publicly to identify as Zionists, when for many Zionism is a core part of the Jewish identity, is a form of religious and cultural discrimination. It’s also probably illegal,” said Lord David Wolfson of Tredegar. “It boils down to this: a university where Jewish students are either not welcome or are made to feel that they are not welcome, is an institution which has entirely forfeited its right to call itself a university.”\nThe report concluded with a set of recommendations for universities and\npolicymakers to restore a sense of safety for Jewish students on campus.\nThese include acknowledging the link between anti-Zionism and antisemitism, clarifying universities’ responsibilities, establishing clear consequences for misbehavior, and expelling students who promote or incite hate and violence.\nThe report also recommended establishing oversight mechanisms to monitor and evaluate university responses to antisemitism, conducting thorough investigations into reported incidents of antisemitism, and engaging Jewish and Israel-supporting students in the creation of safety policies."}

It also set fire to two dumpsters outside the building, according to the school’s account.\n“The UW is committed to maintaining a secure learning and research environment, and strongly condemns this illegal building occupation and the antisemitic statement that was issued by a suspended student group Monday,” wrote the school in a statement. “The University will not be intimidated by this sort of offensive and destructive behavior and will continue to oppose antisemitism in all its forms.”\nIn a statement, the protest organizers, Students United for Palestinian Equality and Return UW, or SUPER UW, wrote that they were protesting the school’s partnership with Boeing, which donated $10 million to the engineering building, over its role in supplying weapons to Israel.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe group praised the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, onslaught on Israel, in which thousands of invading terrorists slaughtered some 1,200 people and abducted 251 to the Gaza Strip, launching the ongoing war in Gaza. Hamas has dubbed the attack the Al-Aqsa Flood.\n“We are taking this building amidst the current and renewed wave of the student Intifada, following the uprising of student action for Palestine after the heroic victory of Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7th, which shattered the illusion of zionist-imperialist domination and brought Palestine to the forefront for all justice-loving people of the world,” the group wrote.\nUW President Ana Mari Cauce condemned the group’s actions and statement on Tuesday.\n“This was no peaceful protest in support of Palestinian rights or against the war in Gaza. I condemn this dangerous, violent and illegal building occupation and related vandalism,” wrote Cauce in a statement. “I also condemn in the strongest terms the group’s statement celebrating the October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians.”\nDuring the occupation, the protesters pulled doors off their hinges, broke expensive manufacturing tools and defaced a Boeing mural, according to local news channel KOMO.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe group also hung a banner from the building renaming it “Shaban al-Dalou Building,” the name of a Palestinian engineering student killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, according to the Seattle Times.\nRoughly 30 protesters were arrested by law enforcement, but it is not yet known if the individuals arrested were UW students, according to the statements from the school.\nThe school year at UW has been bookended by turmoil connected to Israel, the war in Gaza and the status of Jewish students on campus.\nIn early September, an Israeli soldier killed a UW graduate protesting in the West Bank in an incident the military said was unintentional. Weeks later, protesters at a meeting of the school’s regents shouted down a series of Jewish speakers decrying antisemitism.\nThe following month saw the publication of a report by the school’s antisemitism task force that split the campus Jewish community, with more than 150 Jewish faculty, staff, students and alumni signing onto an open letter criticizing it.\nFollowing Monday’s protest, in a post on X, the UW campus Chabad posted a photo of a Jewish student laying tefillin, the ritual prayer item, outside the engineering building after the protest."}

My family military tree can be easily traced back to World War I, and my great uncle fought in the infantry against the invading Germans in 1940, while my paternal grandfather was the personal driver of the commander in chief of the French army, Gen. Maurice Gamelin.\nI grew up listening to their stories and perhaps this is why ever since I became a war photographer, I didn’t just want to photograph wars, but also the veterans who had fought in previous ones. It is within this context that, one day in 2004, I had the idea to photograph World War II veterans and collect their testimonies. In this way, I could create a piece which, in time, would provide real historical value to future generations.\nThe first subject of this photo project came along randomly while I was living in Santa Barbara, California, and beginning my career shooting for local newspapers. I met a friend’s grandfather who had fought as a pilot in the Pacific, and I asked to photograph and interview him about his experiences. And just like that, a photography project that would take me around the world for over 10 years was born.\n00:00 / 23:33\nWithin six months, I had met and photographed veterans of over 15 nationalities, including many Red Army veterans of Jewish descent who had fought on the Eastern Front. Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, all with unique stories of survival and resilience.\nThis portrait series honors the enduring spirit of WWII veterans, capturing their strength, sacrifice, and humanity eight decades after the war’s end.  As we mark the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, these images are a powerful reminder of the individuals, now deceased, who stood for freedom in one of the world’s darkest times.

Rozenberg fought with the Red Army against the invading Germans and Axis allies. (Jonathan Alpeyrie)\n“It purely was by accident that I met my father on the front line during heavy fighting near Warsaw in early 1945. I could not believe my eyes, and quickly embraced him.”\nLeonid Rozenberg was born in 1921 in Izwaslavl, Ukraine. Rozenberg graduated from high school in 1939 and served in the military as a lieutenant in Kiev. He was sent to western Belarussia as part of the 20th division and was wounded by German machine guns. He escaped and returned to the North Caucasian front, where he was promoted to artillery company leader.\nHe fought at the Battle of Rostov and Bielgorod, and took part in the liberation of Kiev in November 1943. Rozenberg later participated in the liberation of Ukraine, Poland, and Germany. He fought in the liberation of Warsaw in early 1945 and received a medal during the Battle of Boevogo-Krasnogo-Znameni. In 1945, Rozenberg met his father, who was later killed by German troops for being Jewish, near the Warsaw front. He fought in the Battle of Berlin in 1945 and was subsequently promoted to major. He remained in Germany until 1950 before returning to Moscow, where he served in the Red Army until 1968.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAlexander Turetsky, Russia\nAlexander Turetsky poses near the Russian World War II Association in Brighton Beach, New York, circa 2005-2015. Turetsky fought with the Red Army against the invading Germans and Axis allies. (Jonathan Alpeyrie)\n“My company was used for reconnaissance. My commanding officer would often send us to the German front lines to try to capture a German soldier and collect information. It was a very dangerous type of mission, but necessary for our victory.”\nBorn in Moscow in 1924, Alexander Turetsky grew up in the capital and completed his education there. He graduated from an officers’ training course as a lieutenant in 1942, still not even 18 years old.\nHe saw heavy action in Leningrad during a German advance and was wounded while looking for a position in which his soldiers could take cover. He served with the 344th Roslavskaya division from January 1942 to January 1945, again seeing action in a village near Moscow as the leader of a company of about 100 men. His unit was often used as a reconnaissance outfit looking for Germans to capture and bring back for questioning.\nHe fought during the entire campaign of Belarussia, as well as in a fierce battle in Smolensk, Russia, where he fought on the outskirts of the city. He also saw heavy action in 1944 during Operation Bagration, which shattered the German front lines and marked the largest defeat in German military history. Turetsky was sent back to military school from January to May 1945 and missed the end of the war. He then returned to military school and retired in 1967 as the commander of a regiment with the rank of colonel.\nJosef Krulyak, Russia\nJosef Krulyak poses near the Russian World War II Association in Brighton Beach, New York, circa 2005-2015. Krulyak fought with the Red Army as a Belarussian against the invading Germans and Axis allies. (Jonathan Alpeyrie)\n“It was never really peaceful on the Black Sea. The Germans often attacked us with their dive bombers, dropping bombs on the decks of our ships. I did my best to shoot them down with our guns, but they were like flies hovering over our positions.”\nBorn on April 18, 1927, Josef Krulyak grew up in Rzhev, Russia. After the war began in June 1941, he and his parents left their hometown to escape the Germans. They worked in a collective farm and later moved to Marmysah, where they worked in stables. Krulyak was drafted in 1944 at just 17 and trained in the Russian navy. He served on the Krasnyikrym destroyer as part of an anti-aircraft cannon crew and first saw action in April of 1944 as part of the Black Sea fleet, fighting against the retreating Axis forces, mostly against attacking German aircraft.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDuring a night shift, Krulyak spotted an object moving in the water that turned out to be a floating mine and reported it to his captain, saving many lives. He participated in small battles inside the city and remained in the eastern Black Sea until the war ended. After the war, the crew remained in Georgia, where it was active until 1951.\nSalomon Freidlyand, Belarussia\nSalomon Freidlyand poses near the Russian World War II Association in Brighton Beach, New York, circa 2005-2015. Freidlyand fought with the Red Army as a Belarussian against the invading Germans and Axis allies. (Jonathan Alpeyrie)\n“I was better-educated than most of the men in the division. My commander asked for volunteers to join a chemical unit. I agreed.”\nBorn in Orsha, Belarussia, in 1921, Salomon Freidlyand moved to Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) in 1925 and studied there between 1929 and 1939. He was drafted into the Red Army in 1939 and trained at Alexandria. He was sent to western Ukraine and became the leader of a 45-millimeter artillery battery.\nWhen the Germans invaded, he was stationed in Slavyansk, where they fought against the advancing German army. Freidlyand was transferred to the 297th division and later to a special chemical division. He graduated from a military training course in February 1942 and became a lieutenant, working with partisans and local spies to gather information on German troops in the area. He was wounded during the Battle of Stalingrad and was sent back to Leningrad. He moved to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, but was unable to find work, and eventually moved to Andijan, where he worked for the government until the end of the war.\nIsrael Barsuk, Ukraine\nIsrael Barsuk poses in his Brighton Beach, New York, apartment, circa 2005-2015. Barsuk fought for the Red Army against the invading Germans and Axis allies. (Jonathan Alpeyrie)\n“My commander was killed in front of me by a German sniper. One moment he was giving orders, a moment later he was no more, face down with a bullet in his head.”\nBorn in Kremnchuk, Ukraine, in 1919, Israel Barsuk was drafted into the army and sent to Komsomolsk-na-amor in Eastern Russia as part of the 220th division in 1939. As Germany invaded in June of 1941, Barsuk was sent back to his division on the southwest front of Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine. He was badly injured during heavy action against German troops and spent four months in a hospital in Ossetia.\nJulia Barsuk in her bedroom in her Brighton Beach, New York, apartment circa 2005-2015.

(Jonathan Alpeyrie)\nThough he had received papers saying he was no longer fit for active duty, in early 1942, he became part of a tank division on the North Caucasian front after convincing his superiors to send him back to the front. Casualties were very heavy as the Red Army concentrated on killing as many Germans as possible.\nBarsuk stayed in the North Caucasus until the end of 1942, then was sent back to  Moscow to provide technical support for armored units fighting on the front. He worked there until the end of the war but was often deployed to various fronts to ensure armored units had the proper replacement parts and pieces, and also went to factories to make sure they were working properly. When the war ended, Barsuk was in Red Square on May 8, 1945.\nADVERTISEMENT\nGregory Gurtovnik, Russia\nGregory Gurtovnik poses near the Russian World War II Association in Brighton Beach, New York, circa 2005-2015.

Our men were dying by the thousands, littering the streets, the rooms inside the gutted apartment that we were defending. The Germans kept on coming and coming.”\nGregory Gurtovnik was born in Salnitza, Ukraine, and moved to Odessa with his family at the age of 7. They later moved to Samarkand during WWII. Gurtovnik volunteered for the Red Army at 18 and joined a tank outfit. He trained in Tajikistan and was sent with the 3rd Tank Army to Ukraine, where he participated in a major offensive to take Kiev from the Germans.\nThe unit was brought to Kanotop by rail and fought to cross the Dnieper River. The Germans were defeated, and more Russian units poured in. After four days, a major engagement followed in which Gurtovnik was wounded and then sent back to the front. After the battle of Kiev, he fought in western Ukraine and participated in battles at Ternopol and Lvov. The battle of Lvov was a hard-fought affair, as the Germans had a large army there and were making a last stand. In September 1944, Gurtovnik fought in Krakow and Berlin as the Red Army incurred heavy casualties. After the Polish campaign, his unit moved to the Elbe River to link up with American forces. The battle ended on May 2, 1945, and they moved to Prague to restore order. After the war, Gurtovnik pursued engineering and joined a submarine outfit.\nSemen Vaidman, Ukraine\nSemen Vaidman sits in his bedroom in his Brighton Beach, New York, home, circa 2005-2015.

(Jonathan Alpeyrie)\n“One morning, we left the line with 100 men in my company, but by the end of the day, only seven of my men and I came back. The Germans had ambushed us. My men were falling all around me. This was one of the hardest days of my life.”\nSemen Vaidman was born in Suvorovo, Ukraine, and spent his childhood in the village before moving to Odessa and Leningrad. He studied at a technical college and later military school. He was sent to Belarussia as part of the Red Army’s 318th Division, where he was an artillery company leader. In 1941, he was one of the division leaders when the Germans invaded Bobruysk. He was questioned by the NKVD for four months and later sent to Stalingrad. He became a drill instructor and commander of a 203-millimeter cannon company. After the Battle of Stalingrad, he returned to the front as part of the 112th Artillery Brigade and was promoted to captain. He fought through Poland and then Germany, where he remained after the war until 1948, fathering a son there. He returned to Moscow in 1959."}

Israel-related antisemitism has sharply increased in universities, the arts and culture scene, and in media portrayals of Israel, the organization said.\nGerman police reported 3,200 antisemitic incidents from January 1 to October 7, 2024, after recording nearly 3,000 incidents, or 32 a day, in the three months following the attack of October 7, 2023.\nThe rise of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, classified by some states as right-wing extremist, is seen as a threat to Jewish religious life in Germany and practices like circumcision and religious slaughter, the report said. AfD insists it is supportive of the Jewish community.\nProtesters wave Israeli flags and hold photos of people held hostage by Hamas in Gaza during a demonstration outside the British prime minister’s offices in London, November 19, 2023. (Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images via JTA)\nIn the United Kingdom, there were 3,528 antisemitic incidents reported in 2024, second only to the record set in 2023, according to the Community Security Trust (CST). Incidents included 201 cases of physical assaults, 157 instances of damage to Jewish property and 223 incidents targeting synagogues.\nThis, along with weekly anti-Israel marches in major cities around the UK, has created a hostile environment for Jews that the Institute of Jewish Policy Research called “ambient antisemitism.” The British government has increased funding for Jewish community security, but more is needed, the report said.\nIn the United States, the Anti-Defamation League found that antisemitism has become a persistent reality, as the number of antisemitic incidents broke records for the fourth year in a row. Some 9,354 incidents were reported in 2024, translating to more than one every hour, including a record 1,694 cases on college campuses.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAntisemitic attitudes are rising in the US, with nearly 24% of Americans agreeing with six or more anti-Jewish tropes, the ADL found. Surveys show that nine out of 10 American Jews believe discrimination against Jews has risen since the October 7 attack, while 83% of Jewish college students reported experiencing or witnessing antisemitism since then.\nFighting hatred on all these fronts will require a sustained effort from all parts of society, J7 concluded.\n“Antisemitism is a transnational challenge and requires transnational cooperation against antisemitic hate,” the report stated. “Just as the J7 communities united to collectively fight the surge of antisemitism, concerned governments, civil society organizations and others must also do their part.”"}

Those strikes were followed on Tuesday by further attacks that the Israeli military said had “completely disabled” Sanaa International Airport in the Houthi-controlled capital.

But Iran, which openly seeks Israel’s destruction, has ramped up its enrichment of uranium to 60 percent purity, which has no peaceful application, and has obstructed international inspectors from checking its nuclear facilities."}

Canada Park, once a haven for hikers and cyclists, lay empty and desolate early Sunday afternoon in wake of the wildfires that devastated central Israel last week.\nThe woodland park, one of the hardest-hit sites during the blazes that tore through the hills west of Jerusalem on Wednesday and Thursday, will take decades to recover, said its chief caretaker at the KKL-JNF Jewish National Fund.\n“It was a gem. It was heaven on earth that was burned,” lamented Nitai Zakharia, the park’s head forester.\n00:00 / 00:00\nZakharia, who has managed the park for seven years as a KKL field director, looked despondent as he surveyed what remained of the forest in his pickup truck that day, passing large swaths of ashen ground where bushes and trees once stood.\nCanada Park, also known as Ayalon-Canada Park, stretches across some 12,000 dunams (3,000 acres) in the Judean foothills.

(Charlie Summers/Times of Israel)\nAccording to official estimates, at least 20,000 dunams (5,000 acres) burned across the area of the Jerusalem hills, devastating forests, though there was only minimal property damage and only a handful of minor injuries.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFirefighters managed to bring the blazes under control by Thursday, but many were still working overtime as of Sunday to combat sudden flare-ups that threatened to reignite conflagrations.\nAs he drove, Zakharia’s walkie-talkie chattered with reports of small fires breaking out. Flames were kicking back up in Kula Forest, near Elad, which also falls under his purview.\nIn Canada Park, several tree trunks were burning idly Sunday afternoon, producing small flames and billows of smoke three full days after firefighters managed to contain the outbreak.\nCanada Park, a KKL-JNF national park in the Judean foothills, a week after it was badly damaged by brush fires on April 30, 2025, video taken May 4, 2025. (Charlie Summers/Times of Israel)\nPointing to leaves that had turned orange-red, Zakharia somberly noted that many of the trees that weren’t burnt to a crisp had still sustained irreparable heat damage and would likely die in the coming weeks.\n‘Farewell to the park’\nIn years past, Canada Park had seen small brush fires that spread across two to three dunams before being quickly extinguished by KKL’s own firefighting division.\n“We weren’t deluding ourselves,” Zakharia said. “It was clear to us that we were sitting on natural resources that were liable to burn, but we never expected a fire like this.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nNitai Zakharia, the head forester of Canada Park, shows a damaged pomegranate tree at the nature site on May 4, 2025. (Charlie Summers/Times of Israel)\nAt 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday morning, as Israelis marked Memorial Day, fire broke out in Eshtaol Forest, immediately south of Canada Park on the other side of Route 1, a major highway connecting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Flames were carried north by dry winds that reached 80 kilometers per hour (50 mph), and it was not long before sparks leapt across the highway into Canada Park.\nThe staff in Zakharia’s region had been spread thin that morning, helping fight fires near Elad and Eshtaol, leaving Canada Park largely undefended. While on his way to the park around noon, Zakharia telephoned a colleague responsible for Eshtaol.\n“I told him: ‘Look, Yaakov, make sure you have tons of forces on the border so that it doesn’t pass over Route 1 toward us.’ He told me that they had 10 fire engines ready to extinguish the fire,” he said.\nBy the time he reached Canada Park, flames had already begun to engulf its trees.\nView of a large fire that broke out near Moshav Eshtaol, April 23, 2025. (Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)\n“It was clear to me that no one would be able to stop the fire in time,” Zakharia recalled. “That was my farewell to the park.”\nFrom a lookout point, the forester watched as some firefighters left the scene to defend nearby communities threatened by the flames.\n“I went to meet the departing group and asked them how they could leave at a time like this. It turned out that they had almost got trapped in the fire, and that their fire engine even went up in flames,” he said.\nDays after the fire, the burnt-out frame of a a fire engine stood on the edge of the forest near the highway. Blackened remains of fire extinguishers and nozzles lay strewn about alongside melted metal that was still warm to the touch.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA burnt-out fire engine that went up in flames during massive wildfires in central Israel on April 30, 2025, photo taken May 4, 2025. (Charlie Summers/Times of Israel)\nInvestigators have yet to determine what started the fires but are thought to believe negligence was the trigger, despite rumors of arson committed by Palestinian saboteurs.\nZakharia dismissed the notion that human activity was to blame, noting the day’s hot and dry conditions and high gusting winds, as well as the topography.\n“A large wildfire is almost always the consequence of the weather conditions. You almost never encounter big wildfires like this one if the weather conditions aren’t already very severe,” he said.\nThe fact that the fires came at the park from an incline only worsened the situation, he said, since “as we know, fire loves to rise upwards.”\n“Nothing was working in our favor here,” he concluded.\n‘Struggling to manage’\nAs Zakharia showed The Times of Israel around what remained of Canada Park, Environmental Protection Minister Idit Silman arrived unannounced with two of her aides.\nShe rolled her window down from the back seat of her black government-issued Audi and asked how he was doing.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“We could really use some government backing. We’re really struggling to manage here,” he told her.\nView of a massive wildfire near Mevo Horon, April 30, 2025. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nLast week, as the fires stretched resources, prompting pleas for help from abroad, many noted that the government had cut funding for the Fire and Rescue Authority by NIS 217 million ($60 million) in the national budget passed just weeks earlier.\nSilman vowed a government resolution without going into detail, took Zakharia’s phone number, and went on her way.\nFurther down the trail, Zakharia explained that the ideal form of government support, in his view, would consist of fire buffer zones and other preventative measures in populated areas, to slow the spread of fires there.\nSuch barriers would lessen the strain on Israel’s small firefighting force, allowing more firefighters to deploy to forests rather than cities and towns.\n“If a town isn’t well taken care of, you’ll have 100 teams stationed there, but if it is well taken care of, maybe 20 teams will go to defend the town from the fire, while the other 80 can go and save the forest,” he explained.\nA firefighter tries to extinguish a massive wildfire at Canada Park, west of Jerusalem, April 30, 2025. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nAccording to the Fire and Rescue Authority, manpower falls far below the ideal firefighter-to-resident ratio determined by the OECD, which makes policy recommendations for developed countries. While the global norm stands at one career firefighter per every 1,000 residents, Israeli fire teams are only able to employ one firefighter for every 4,500 people.\n“We are stretched from end to end,” said Fire and Rescue Authority spokeswoman Tal Volvovitch to The Times of Israel in January.\nBut no amount of government backing will be able to speed up the decades-long process needed for Canada Park to return to what it once was.\n“In order to once again call this place a forest, we’ll need at least 20 years, and that’s only on the condition it doesn’t catch fire again,” Zakharia said, pointing to decades-old oak trees planted in the 1970s, when the park was founded. Even saplings will likely take at least three years to bloom.\nHistory enthusiasts take part in the reenactment of the 1187 Knights pilgrimage to Jerusalem, in Canada Park, on December 14, 2018. (Yaniv Nadav/Flash90)\nMany ecologists say periodic wildfires are a natural process and key to maintaining healthy woodland ecosystems, cleaning out dead organic material and helping to support species diversity by putting nutrients into the soil and opening up space for new growth.\nOver the next few years, Zakharia hopes to turn the disaster into a fresh start for Canada Park, including adopting a more fire-conscious approach to how it is reforested.\nTo this end, he and his team intend to replant trees further apart from one another along the park’s main pathways and to create more vegetation-free buffer zones throughout the site.\n“Just minutes after witnessing the fire, I began to think about the forest’s rehabilitation,” he said. “This is what puts wind in our sails.”"}

However, it took troops some two weeks to secure control of the Jenin refugee camp, military officials told reporters during a tour of Jenin on Wednesday.\nMost of the Palestinian civilians in the camp have evacuated, allowing Israeli troops to search and clear each individual building of infrastructure and weapons used by local terror groups. More than 40,000 Palestinians have left their homes since the launch of Operation Iron Wall, according to Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA.\nSince the start of the operation, the military has reported killing over 100 terror operatives, arresting around 320 wanted suspects and seizing approximately 450 weapons in the northern West Bank.\nIn total, the IDF claims to have killed more than 700 terrorists in the northern West Bank, including 36 senior operatives from various terror groups, since the war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, following Hamas’s invasion of southern Israel.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe military attributed the significant decline in terror attacks from the West Bank to these efforts.

The effects of the IDF’s counterterrorism measures can also be felt on the ground, military officials said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe commander of the Kfir Brigade’s Nahshon Battalion, Lt. Col. Yud — identified only by his first Hebrew initial due to security concerns — said that for the first time in his 15-year military career, he can enter Palestinian towns and villages without facing stone-throwing or other forms of attack.\nThe goal of the operation, said the commander of the West Bank division, Brig. Gen. Yaki Dolf, “is to dismantle the entire system — from the roots — starting with achieving operational control over key strongholds, particularly Jenin.”\n“As a result of the operation, today we can operate anywhere, at any time, even in the heart of the camps,” Dolf said.\nThe military’s ongoing operations have significantly damaged the infrastructure of the camp, which housed some 3,000 Palestinian residents before the start of the counterterrorism operation.

(Stav Levaton/Times of Israel)\n“We don’t demolish for the sake of demolishing,” asserted the chief of operations in the IDF’s Menashe Regional Brigade, Maj. Alef, who also maintained anonymity for security reasons. He emphasized that the military only targets terrorist infrastructure and buildings deemed necessary to clear access routes for troops.\nAs part of these route-clearing efforts, the IDF said that in recent months it demolished roughly 100 buildings in Jenin, with an additional 100 in Tulkarem, to the southwest, and the adjacent Nur Shams camp.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDespite the devastation in the Jenin refugee camp, the city of Jenin remains a hub of daily civilian life. Its open-air market continues to operate, alongside functioning shops and schools throughout the city.\nThe IDF has yet to announce an official plan regarding what will happen to the Palestinians who fled Jenin refugee camp in January, or when they will be allowed back to their homes.

(Stav Levaton/Times of Israel)\n“We are conducting a systematic pursuit using intelligence to track down terrorists who fled the camp; we have a detailed tracking chart covering all routes,” Dolf said.\nThe military believes that many Palestinians involved in terror have become repeat offenders. It said that around 82% of those released in the 2011 Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange returned to terrorist activity — including Yahya Sinwar, the architect of Hamas’s October 7 attack, who was killed in Gaza late last year.\nSimilarly, officials claim that half of the Palestinians freed in the November 2023 hostage deal with Hamas — which secured the release of 105 living hostages during a weeklong truce — have since reengaged in terrorism.\nIt remains unclear how many of the Palestinian prisoners released as part of the most recent ceasefire deal in January, which secured the release of 33 hostages, have since resumed terrorist activity.\n“Any terrorist who returns to terrorism will bear responsibility,” Dolf vowed."}

(Nati Shohat/Flash90)\n“We should have stayed there in order to control the territory,” Gantz said. “But principally there was a need to remain there in order to inform the world that the ’67 lines are irrelevant,” he added, referring to Israel’s borders before the Six Day War of June 1967, when the country captured from Jordan territories currently claimed by the Palestinians for a future state, including the Gaza Strip.\nHe said he supports establishing security control of the Strip, but that rebuilding settlements there “would be a mistake defense-wise, and would also divide the nation at a time when we need unity.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The State of Israel cannot allow a direct and substantive threat to its citizens on all its borders,” said Gantz. “Therefore, [it] needs security control and to preserve freedom of action in Gaza, the West Bank, southern Lebanon, and in the border region with Syria”\n“The implication is clear, and anyone who talks about a Palestinian state or withdrawals is simply disconnected from the security reality,” he added.\nTroops of the 188th Armored Brigade operate in southern Gaza’s Rafah, in a handout photo issued on May 6, 2025. (Israel Defense Forces)\nGantz’s rejection of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict drew criticism from left-wing politicians. The Democrats MK Gilad Kariv wrote on social media that “after October 7, the idea that it is possible to ignore the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and not offer any diplomatic path is even more disconnected from reality.”\nHe added that there was “a need to present an alternative of renewing the diplomatic dialogue between Jerusalem and Ramallah within the framework of a regional pact and under an international umbrella.”\nGantz, who entered politics in 2018, three years after he retired as IDF chief of staff, has previously expressed support for a “two-entity solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As defense minister in 2021, he met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas — the first such meeting in years — and reportedly told him that he wants to be a “new Rabin,” referring to prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated for pursuing a two-state solution.\nOpinion polls early in the current Gaza war positioned Gantz as a leading candidate for prime minister, rewarding his ostensible statesmanship in joining the government days after thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed southern Israel on October 7, 2023, to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages.\nGantz’s lead in polls has since deflated. More recent surveys show him losing many voters to a potential party led by former prime minister Naftali Bennett, who has consistently rejected Palestinian statehood."}

(Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)\nThe merger “will restore the first Trump term framework of a unified US diplomatic mission in Israel’s capital that reports to the US Ambassador to Israel [Mike] Huckabee, [who] will take the steps necessary to implement the merger over the coming weeks,” said State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce during a briefing.\n“The United States remains committed to its historic relationship with Israel, bolstering Israel’s security and securing peace to create a better life for the entire region,” Bruce said, making no mention of the US relationship with the Palestinians, which appeared to be further downgraded by the merger.\nADVERTISEMENT\nUS President Donald Trump’s administration has had a very minimal relationship with the Palestinian Authority thus far. Trump held a phone call with PA President Mahmoud Abbas shortly after he was elected in November, but the two have spoken since. Rubio visited the region in February, but did not make a stop in the West Bank.\nThe New York Times reported that Huckabee has recently told staff at the embassy that he wants to meet with senior PA officials in Ramallah. It is unclear whether Palestinian officials will agree to meet the new US ambassador, who is a major proponent of Israel’s settlement movement. When the US closed its consulate in Jerusalem during Trump’s first term, PA officials refused to meet with diplomats from the then-recently-downgraded Palestinian Affairs Bureau.\nLast week, The Times of Israel reported that the State Department is planning to eliminate the office of the US Security Coordinator (USSC) in Jerusalem, which helps bolster security coordination between Israel and the PA.\nThe cut is part of a broader reorganization of the State Department that Rubio is advancing, which will see the shuttering of dozens of offices around the globe, the sources said.\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas listens while then-US President Donald Trump makes a statement for the press before a meeting at the Palace Hotel during the 72nd United Nations General Assembly on September 20, 2017, in New York.

However, Washington has sharpened its rhetoric as the reform has taken time to implement. Last month, though, the PA invited US officials to come to Ramallah to certify that the new welfare system is in place so that the Authority can come into compliance with congressional legislation that bars US aid that directly benefits the PA over its so-called pay-to-slay scheme.\nIn Trump’s first term, the US closed the Palestinians’ diplomatic mission in Washington and cut aid to the Palestinians.

(Sam Sokol/Times of Israel)\nDespite the prime minister’s assurances to his ultra-Orthodox allies, the legislation, angrily referred to by critics as an “evasion law,” has long been held up in the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, whose chairman, Yuli Edelstein (Likud), has pledged that he will “only produce a real conscription law that will significantly increase the IDF’s conscription base.”\nAddressing a conference organized by the national-religious broadsheet Makor Rishon on Tuesday, Edelstein said that after exhaustive debate, his committee was “one step away” from drafting a new version of the law.\nIf the bill fails to pass, or if it passes in a format that does not maintain widespread Haredi exemptions, it could significantly threaten the stability of the coalition.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn Monday evening, UTJ lawmaker Yaakov Asher told Haredi news site Kikar HaShabbat that if the military exemptions were not legislated by the end of the summer session, his party would  no longer be able to remain in the government.\nUTJ’s exit would not topple the government but it would leave it with a bare 61-seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset.\nRabbinical courts\nThe Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee has resumed debating a controversial bill intended to grant state rabbinic courts the power to arbitrate civil proceedings according to religious law if both parties consent.\nWhile its backers say that the measure would allow for “legal pluralism,” critics believe that, if passed, it would significantly harm women.\nIsraelis protest the government’s planned judicial overhaul outside the Rabbinical Court in Tel Aviv, July 18, 2023 (Miriam Alster/Flash90)\nAccording to the ITIM nonprofit — which helps Israelis navigate the country’s religious bureaucracy — the religious court system, whose judges are all men, “is fundamentally male-oriented, which naturally raises concerns about structural harm to women’s rights, even if unintentional.”\nIn addition, “religious courts are not bound by the protective laws that the state has enacted to protect workers’ rights,” the group said in a position paper late last year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSplitting the AG’s role\nThe coalition is also pushing a variety of bills that critics warn are intended to silence detractors and weaken oversight, including a measure to dilute the powers of the attorney general and create a new criminal prosecution service, putting the government in charge of who heads it.\nThe bill, which was approved by the Ministerial Committee for Legislation on Sunday, would essentially split off the role of chief prosecutor from the attorney general’s job description, and put it in the hands of a “prosecutor general” who would be nominated by the justice minister and approved by the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, which is controlled by the coalition.\nOpposition parties have denounced the legislation as an effort by the government to influence Netanyahu’s ongoing corruption trial and weaken the institution of criminal prosecution in general, especially when it comes to suspected political corruption. The coalition has argued, however, that the bill is crucial in ensuring that the head of the criminal prosecution is independent of the government, because the attorney general, as the government’s chief legal adviser, is supposed to also help it achieve its policy goals.\nAttorney General Gali Baharav-Miara attends a Constitution, Law and Justice Committee meeting in the Knesset, Jerusalem, November 18, 2024. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nTaxing NGOs, disqualifying candidates\nAt the same time, lawmakers are also debating legislation that would levy massive taxes on nongovernment organizations funded by foreign governments, and erode their right to file lawsuits in Israeli courts.\nThe bill, sponsored by Likud MK Ariel Kallner, would allow the government to tax foreign government donations to domestic nonprofits at a rate of 80 percent, while also stipulating that courts need not consider petitions by groups “primarily financed by a foreign political entity.”\nGroups such as B’Tselem, Breaking the Silence, and the New Israel Fund have long been targeted by the right wing and even the political center over their focus on alleged Israeli human rights abuses against Palestinians.\nWhile backers argue that the bill would protect civil society from malign foreign influence, critics have said the government has no moral standing to complain about outside actors as two of Netanyahu’s top aides are under investigation for alleged financial ties to Qatar.\nDuring a debate on Monday, Hadash-Ta’al MK Ahmad Tibi claimed that the bill was intended “to prevent campaigns to encourage voting in Arab society.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nTibi noted that the coalition is also currently working to pass a bill “that aims to make it easier to disqualify Arab slates” from running for Knesset.\nAn Israeli casts a vote at a voting station in Jerusalem on March 23, 2021. (Olivier Fitoussi/Flash90)\nDuring a marathon plenum session just before the beginning of the recess, lawmakers voted 22-0 to approve the first reading of a bill to disqualify a candidate or slate of candidates from running in municipal elections if they have denied the existence of the State of Israel as Jewish and democratic, or expressed support for terrorism or armed struggle against Israel.\nCutting judges’ salaries\nAnother new bill, approved by the Ministerial Committee for Legislation at the same meeting as the bill splitting the role of the attorney general, would see the formation of a three-member public committee that would determine the salary of the president of Israel, from which all other officials’ salaries would be derived as percentages, in a manner that backers maintain is intended “to create equality between the governmental authorities.”\nCritics on both sides of the aisle have contended that the legislation is meant to raise officials’ salaries during wartime, although sponsor Avihai Boaron (Likud) argues that it would actually lead to salary cuts for the highest earners — many of whom are judges.\n‘Who Watches the Watchmen?’\nWhile initially withdrawing its backing last year, the coalition recently decided that it would advance legislation placing a police internal affairs unit under the authority of Justice Minister Yariv Levin.\nThe bill to subordinate the Department of Internal Police Investigations (DIPI) — which was initially proposed last year by Likud MK Moshe Saada, a former deputy head of the department, and approved in a preliminary reading — had widely been seen as part of a government project aimed at handing politicians the reins over key law enforcement bodies.\nCurrently, the DIPI operates under the purview of the State Attorney’s Office, a separate organizational unit within the Justice Ministry. The bill would see the department instead report directly to a cabinet minister and come under the supervision of the Justice Ministry’s director general.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe department is currently tasked with investigating suspected crimes committed by police officers and employees of the Shin Bet security agency, and can in certain cases conduct criminal and disciplinary investigations into wrongdoing by civil service employees. Under the new law, the DIPI’s powers would also be expanded to allow probes into state prosecutors.\nJustice Minister Yariv Levin, right, and Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara attend a farewell ceremony for then-acting Supreme Court President Uzi Vogelman, at the Supreme Court in Jerusalem, October 1, 2024. (Oren Ben Hakoon/Pool)\nWhile the text of the bill states that “the department will be independent and will operate with full freedom of action in the exercise of its professional powers,” critics have argued that the move will neuter the DIPI by putting it under political control.\nControlling ratings data, selling off public broadcasting\nThe new legislative session is also expected to see a concerted push to advance Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi’s media overhaul agenda.\nKarhi has vowed since taking office more than two years ago to shut down the Kan public broadcaster, putting forward several plans that have all since stalled.\nThe most recent proposed legislation, part of a larger media overhaul package advocated by Karhi, stipulates that if a private buyer for Kan cannot be found within two years, the broadcaster will be shuttered completely and its intellectual property will revert to the government. The bill passed a preliminary reading in the Knesset in November 2024, but when it later came up for discussion in the Economic Affairs Committee, Bitan said that he “can’t advance this bill for a simple reason — public broadcasting is necessary.”\nA similar bill would shutter Army Radio.\nLikud members (L-R) Shlomo Karhi, David Bitan and David Amsalem attend a committee meeting at the Knesset on November 20, 2023. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nIn an effort to bypass opposition from Knesset Economic Affairs Committee Chairman David Bitan (Likud), Karhi has proposed establishing a new “media committee,” an idea rejected by Bitan but reportedly supported by Netanyahu.\nBitan has also pledged to freeze work on legislation that would grant the government oversight over television ratings data and force broadcasters to regularly report such data, which Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara has argued would violate key constitutional principles, including the right to privacy and freedom of the press.\nHowever, Bitan indicated that he would not hinder two additional bills — one that would compel Kan to justify its decisions to the committee on an annual basis, and another that would give the government direct instead of indirect control over the broadcaster’s budget. These, he said, would be considered by the committee.\nImmunity from investigation\nLawmakers may also advance legislation aimed at providing criminal protection to IDF soldiers and members of the intelligence and security communities who provide intelligence without authorization to the prime minister and members of his security cabinet.\nAnother bill that could also potentially advance is an initiative by firebrand Likud MK Tally Gotliv strengthening MKs’ parliamentary immunity.\nAnother bill that has not yet been submitted but that could come up during the current legislative session is a proposal by Likud MK Kallner to establish an alternative probe into the events of October 7, 2023.\nAnti-government activist Shikma Bressler (R) and MK Tally Gotliv (C) arrive for a court hearing in Bressler’s defamation lawsuit against Gotliv at the District Court in Lod, September 17, 2024. (Jonathan Shaul/Flash90)\nOn Monday, the government reportedly decided to seek to establish a “special” commission to probe the devastating Hamas-led invasion, but rejected a call from Baharav-Miara for an official state commission of inquiry, which would have the broadest powers.\nAccording to Kallner’s proposal, members of the alternate investigatory body would not be chosen by the president of the Supreme Court — as is the case with a state commission of inquiry — but would instead be appointed by the Knesset.\nAsked for comment, Kallner told The Times of Israel that he believes his proposal will advance as a bill during the current legislative session.\nJeremy Sharon contributed to this report."}

(Avshalom Sassoni/Flash90)\nThe extended Kuperstein family, including Bar’s parents, Tal and Julie, his four siblings, his grandparents, aunt, uncle, and cousins, all of whom live in Holon within easy walking distance of one another, were having the same kinds of reactions.\n“We yelled, we screamed, and then we said, ‘What do we do now?'” said Rubinstein.\n“Our luck was that we knew he was a captive, not because someone official told us, but because we saw him in that Telegram video,” she said, referring to the uncertainty surrounding many others who went missing during the attack.\nOver the next two days, Tesler said, he found out that many of his friends had been either killed or taken hostage, including fellow security guards Eitan Mor, Andrey Kozlov and Rom Braslavski, all captives.\nKozlov was rescued in June, while Mor and Braslavski are still held hostage, along with Bar.\nOn April 5, the terror group Hamas released a propaganda video featuring Kuperstein and Maxim Herkin, a Nova partygoer, in the first sign of life from both hostages since they were abducted.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMaxim Herkin was taken captive from the Supernova desert rave on October 7, 2023 by Hamas terrorists (Courtesy)\nThe family has spoken with released hostages, including Ohad Ben Ami, freed in February, who was kept with Bar for a while in the tunnels.\n“He said his condition isn’t good, he’s in the tunnels,” said Rubinstein. “I saw the images of him from the video. He’s sad, he’s wan and pale.”\nRubinstein said that Bar looks better in the video than Ben Ami has described him, as her nephew lost more than 50% of his body weight.\n“He looks a little better now because their Hamas captors started feeding them, assuming they would be released,” she said. “He was a little chubby before, he looked like his father,” gesturing to her brother.\nThe family learned other details about Bar in captivity. Always handy, he had fixed the electricity in the tunnels and helped arrange a crude plumbing setup in their underground cells.\n“He loves to do things, he loves to help,” said Rubinstein.\n“MacGyver!” said Tal, referring to the 1980s television show about a secret agent who performs complicated missions with the help of his knowledge of science and his Swiss Army knife.\nIt’s his nickname for his beloved son.\nBar has also learned some Russian because of spending time in captivity with Maxim Herkin, a dual Russian-Israeli citizen, said Rubinstein.\nIt brings their family history full circle, she said.\nHer mother, Faina, Bar’s grandmother, was born in Moldova, while her father, Michael, a Holocaust survivor, narrowly escaped death in 1941 when his mother fled the Nazi advance in the Soviet Union and hid him in Tashkent — in what is now Uzbekistan — just months after his birth.\nReleased hostages and hostages’ family members, including Faina and MIchael Kuperstein, grandparents of hostage Bar Kuperstein, third and fourth from the left, stand outside Auschwitz’s crematorium at March of the Living on April 24, 2025.

The family immigrated to Israel in 1972, when Ora was 4 and Tal was still a baby.\n“We don’t have Russian citizenship,” said Rubinstein, as anyone who fled the Soviet Union from the 1970s through 1991 didn’t receive citizenship.\nEven so, the family has appealed to the Russian government to help free Bar, as Moscow did in November 2023 with former hostages Elena Troufanov and her mother Irena Tati.\nAnd Kuperstein and his son Dvir are joining a Hostages Forum mission to Washington, DC, next week with his son Dvir, hoping for assistance from US President Donald Trump. The trip follows an op-ed piece that Kuperstein recently published in the American conservative media site The Daily Wire.\n“As Israel marks its 77th Independence Day and President Donald Trump completes his first 100 days in office, my heart is somewhere else entirely: in the darkness of Gaza, where my son Bar remains in captivity — frail, frightened, and forgotten by far too many,” wrote Kuperstein.\nIn the letter, Kuperstein describes his son as a pillar of the family since his father’s accident five years ago.\n“We’re doing everything we can,” said Rubinstein. “When you turn to the world, to Trump, that’s the most important thing. He should read Tal’s letter, and pay attention to his words. He’s asking Trump to help bring Bar back home.”"}

While Netanyahu has left open the possibility of withdrawing from the territory if Hamas agrees to free the hostages and give up its weapons, his far-right coalition partners — to whom he is beholden in order to stay in power — have asserted that the takeover will be permanent and that the plan is to reestablish Israeli settlements in the coastal enclave.\nPolls have indicated that this, too, is out of step with the majority of Israelis.\nWitkoff demonstrated familiarity with some of these dynamics during a March podcast interview with Tucker Carlson.\nThen, he said that while Netanyahu may care about the plight of the hostages, “the rap he gets is that he’s more concerned about the fight.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nA rally calling for the release of Israelis held hostage by Hamas terrorists in Gaza, at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, April 26, 2025.

[But] I think he goes up against public opinion… because public opinion there wants those hostages home,” Witkoff added.\nThe Trump envoy began his short speech on Monday by extending congratulations on behalf of the US president to Israel on its 77th Independence Day, which was marked last week.\n“This year has been challenging, and our celebration is bittersweet while 59 hostages remain cruelly held by Hamas,” Witkoff said.\n“I remember being in the hospital in Israel when we got the female IDF soldiers out and I sang, ‘Am Yisrael Chai’ with the families,” he recalled. “I thought to myself, ‘This could be the most joyous moment in my life.”\nUS Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff (second from right) meets with four IDF soldiers freed from Gaza captivity, at the Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, January 30, 2025.

Well outside the tent encampments, compounds will be set up from which aid will be distributed. Designated and vetted representatives from each family will have to travel by foot to the compound in order to pick up a large box of food that is meant to be enough to sustain their families for a week or two, with Israel’s goal being that this new, strictly monitored procedure will ensure that aid isn’t diverted by Hamas.\nIn order to avoid direct IDF involvement in the aid distribution, the Israeli plan envisions private American security firms along with international organizations handing out and securing the aid. However, the UN on Sunday said it would not cooperate with a plan that it says does not adequately address the humanitarian crisis and instead turns aid into a political tool by Israel.\nThe lack of cooperation from the international community further complicates efforts to fund the Israeli initiative or ensure its success.\nEarlier Monday, Trump said his administration will help get food to “starving” Gazans during the ongoing Israeli aid blockade, but added that Hamas has made it “impossible” by diverting humanitarian assistance for its fighters.\nPalestinians queue for a hot meal at a charity kitchen at the Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip on May 4, 2025 (Eyad BABA / AFP)\nWitkoff, in his speech at the embassy event, also said the administration would work to expand the Abraham Accords normalization agreements that the US brokered between Israel and its Arab neighbors during Trump’s first term in office. “We think [we] will have some or a lot of announcements very, very shortly.”\n“The coming year will also see discussions on regional challenges in the Middle East, like Syria, Lebanon and, of course, Iran — and we agree that they shall never get a nuclear weapon,” Witkoff said to applause.\nThe latter issue has been a point of quiet contention between the US and Israel, with Jerusalem concerned that Washington, in its ongoing direct talks with Iran, will agree to allow Tehran to maintain its nuclear enrichment program.\nWitkoff and other US officials have made comments indicating as much, but Trump himself took a harder line on Sunday, asserting that he would only accept the “total dismantlement” of Iran’s nuclear program, while leaving open the possibility for the Islamic Republic to pursue civilian nuclear energy."}

In September 2024, Israel’s Channel 12 published recordings of Hamas operatives discussing the transportation of humanitarian aid from warehouses stocked with supplies to the group’s leaders in Khan Younis.\nOn March 30, Israel’s High Court of Justice ruled that humanitarian organizations petitioning for the resumption of aid deliveries to Gaza “had not proven that Israel was starving the population of the Strip,” though, the judges noted that the decision did not cover the period following Israel’s complete halt of aid into Gaza.\nIn its verdict, the court noted that Israel, as a rule, does not itself supply humanitarian goods to Gaza, but had allowed their entry into the territory during the relevant period as per instructions from the political leadership.\nIn his decision, Chief Justice Isaac Amit wrote that terrorist organizations were embedded within the civilian population and seizing humanitarian aid. Israel’s obligations to assist Gaza’s civilian population must be balanced against operational needs, including preventing assistance from reaching terror groups, he said.\nIsrael is expected to resume aid deliveries in the coming weeks, but how that happens has become a point of contention within the political leadership and between the government and the Israel Defense Forces.\nSeeking to get assistance to Gazan civilians while preventing it from falling into the hands of Hamas, a plan has taken shape that would do away with wholesale distribution and warehousing of aid.\nADVERTISEMENT\nInstead, international organizations and private security contractors will hand out boxes of food to individual Gazan families from within an IDF-secured zone inside Gaza, an Israeli and Arab official familiar with the matter told The Times of Israel last week.\nAt a recent cabinet meeting, Defense Minister Israel Katz pressed the issue, suggesting that aid distribution be managed by civilian American companies under military supervision, or directly by the IDF.\nIDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir rejected the prospect of the IDF being directly involved in handing out assistance, echoing the position of his predecessor Herzi Halevi.\nPalestinian children suffering from malnutrition wait at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on June 24, 2024, after they reportedly were given permission by the Israeli army to leave Gaza (Photo by Bashar TALEB / AFP)\nAccording to reports, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich snapped at Zamir, telling him, “We have instructed you to prepare for this. We tell you what [to do] and you will figure out how. If you can’t, we’ll find someone who can.”\nIn the meantime, Hamas’s stockpiles of hoarded food are shrinking, and estimates of how long its supplies may last vary from two months to half a year. With its stores dissipating, according to the Wall Street Journal, the terror group’s difficulties in raising money and recruiting new fighters and support are only expected to compound.\nChild malnutrition rising again\nExperts worry that the hunger woes will be felt most acutely by Gaza’s most vulnerable. In the first two weeks of April, 64 children in the Strip were diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition, or SAM. Another 641 were found to have moderate acute malnutrition, according to OCHA, the UN humanitarian affairs agency, citing data from aid organizations that screened 21,000 children.\nAt one hospital in the relatively well-off Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City,  3-5 children were diagnosed with SAM and related medical complications weekly over the past month, more than double the average rate in February.\nJust over 2,000 children were diagnosed with acute malnutrition in February, the lowest number since reliable data began being collected eight months earlier, likely thanks to the ceasefire and aid flooding into the Strip.\nBy March, the number had risen to over 3,700, according to the UN, relying on data collected by a number of humanitarian organizations in Gaza, including UN agencies and non-governmental organizations. (Screenings also rose from 84,000 in February to 92,000 in March.)\nPalestinians wait in front of a free food distribution point to receive a hot meal, at the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip on April 19, 2025. (Eyad BABA / AFP)\nDr. Iyas al-Bursh, a physician at Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip, said he had seen the number of children arriving at the hospital with nutrition-related health issues rise over the previous two months, including malnutrition and physical weakness.\n“There is currently no food in the hospital, such as dairy products or fruits, which wounded patients need to regain strength and replenish their blood supply,” he told The Times of Israel by phone. “This delays recovery and weakens patients’ ability to fight infections.”\nThe famine that wasn’t\nWhen Israel halted aid into Gaza on March 2, it marked the end of what had been nearly 15 months of aid being let into the Strip. On October 21, 2023, deliveries of food and other types of assistance began entering the enclave via the Rafah crossing with Egypt, following a two-week total siege on the Strip sparked by the October 7 Hamas attack, in which some 1,200 people were slaughtered across southern Israel and 251 kidnapped into Gaza.\nDespite the deliveries, Israel has been hounded by accusations throughout the war that it has not allowed enough assistance into the Strip, quickly leading to a deluge of reports of rising hunger and rocketing food prices in the enclave, which were later echoed by humanitarian organizations and the UN.\nThe claims seemed to climax in March 2024, when the Famine Review Committee of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system, a committee composed of international famine experts operating under the auspices of the UN, warned that famine was “projected and imminent,” particularly in northern Gaza. Some 677,000 people were already under a food insecurity “catastrophe,” it alleged.\nBut that predicted famine — as defined by the expert committee — evidently did not materialize; by June the same committee published an updated report stating that “available evidence does not indicate that famine is currently occurring.”\nThe effects of the alarm, however, have continued to ripple outward.\nThe data used by the famine review boards served as evidence by the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court prosecutor in legal proceedings initiated against Israel. Today, war crimes charges hang over the head of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, who are accused of using starvation as a method of war.\nOn the other side, doubts raised over the veracity of the famine claim may have resulted in some being less willing to take seriously claims of hunger in Gaza, even as food shortages appear to take hold in the Strip again.\nPalestinian children eat as they sit near the doorway of a damaged house in Gaza City on May 1, 2025. (Photo by Omar AL-QATTAA / AFP)\nIn mid-February, the organization UK Lawyers for Israel published a review finding that not only had no famine occurred, but one may not have been imminent at that time, with even levels of acute malnutrition only marginally higher than prewar figures.\nThe group alleged that there had been severe problems with warnings regarding food availability issued by organizations that underpinned the famine warning, due to what it said was their use of “incomplete or inaccurate data,” inconsistent application of methodological standards, failure to take into account new data, and “potential bias.”\nTwo weeks after the report was issued, the trucks ferrying aid into Gaza went idle for 63 days and counting."}

A passerby with a flannel shirt tied around her waist snapped a furtive photo of the woman, and a man began to tail her from the opposite side of the street, noting the precise time and location of her stops and movements.\nAn hour later, all three were debriefing in a nearby conference room. The woman in black was a trainer for the Community Security Service, a nonprofit that trains volunteer synagogue guards throughout the US, and the two surveilling her were participants in a training program. The exercise was part of a three-day course for 10 CSS volunteers at the organization’s new facility in Westchester County.\nThe facility, the first in the US dedicated to training synagogue guards, is part of the group’s expanding efforts to protect Jewish institutions, as American Jews build out an array of connected security measures amid a global surge in antisemitism.\nCSS granted The Times of Israel exclusive access to the training facility on the condition that it not divulge the building’s location, volunteers’ identities, or certain details of the group’s protocols, due to security concerns.\nCSS was established as a non-profit by several congregants at a New York City synagogue in 2007. The group is modeled on volunteer guard programs for Jewish communities in Europe, where security became a concern before it became one in the US.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nRichard Priem, the group’s CEO, got his start as a volunteer guard when he was a teenager growing up in Amsterdam in the early 2000s. At the start of the training, the group watched a short documentary on a deadly shooting at a Jewish school in Toulouse, France.\n“We never thought that in the United States people would start feeling that way as well. We always thought that this is something that happens in Europe, in the Middle East, but there are two places where Jews are safe. One is Israel,” Priem told the guards at the start of the training. “The other was the United States, and we’ve seen now that’s no longer the case.”\nFlowers surround Stars of David in a makeshift memorial outside the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on October 31, 2018, four days after a gunman killed 11 people attending services there. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File)\nSecurity efforts for US Jews gained steam after the Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh in 2018. More deadly attacks on Jews followed, in Poway, California; Jersey City, New Jersey; and Monsey, New York. The October 2023 Hamas assault on Israel and ensuing wave of antisemitism was another shock to US Jews.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCSS expanded as those fears grew, and now counts around 5,000 active volunteers in 25 states. In the past five years, CSS’s staff has grown from two to 20.\nOne of the guards at the course, a woman in her 50s from New York, started with CSS eight years ago. She saw attitudes toward security start to change with the Tree of Life shooting.\n“That really brought it home. It could happen to any synagogue, any school,” she said. “When I first started, people didn’t take it as seriously. ‘Why do we have to do this? Why do you have to check my bag?’ It was a pain. Over the years, people are used to it and they appreciate it.”\nCSS trained local leaders on an ad hoc basis, using a one-on-one mentoring model in their communities. Those local leaders would then pass the training on to rank-and-file volunteers.\nAs the group grew, its leadership realized it needed a more formal training system, an established curriculum, and a central location to bring together volunteers from around the US for more advanced training. In 2022, CSS started hosting annual retreats. The first year, 50 volunteers showed up. Last year’s retreat in Pennsylvania brought in more than 200 applicants, but could only accommodate 75 trainees.\nThe training facility located in CSS’s headquarters, is the next step in building the group’s infrastructure. CSS opened the headquarters, housed in a nondescript office building, in December to streamline its operations and bring in groups of volunteers from around the US year-round to train as synagogue guards.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSecurity personnel search peoples’ bags and clothes as they arrive for an interfaith service at Park East Synagogue in New York, Wednesday, October 31, 2018. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\nThe participants are expected to bring those lessons back to their local communities, where a vast majority of the training still takes place. CSS held around 700 training sessions throughout the US last year, Priem said.\nThe synagogue guards, who work with local law enforcement and often volunteer alongside paid armed guards hired by individual synagogues or provided by local federations, are meant to be part of an interlocking system of Jewish security organizations that has developed over the years.\nThe array includes the Secure Community Network and the Community Security Initiative, which collect intelligence, with CSI focusing on the New York region.\nThe Anti-Defamation League does research and advocacy. Groups such as Guardian Self Defense teach Krav Maga. The organizations collaborate with each other and with law enforcement. CSS volunteers train in Krav Maga with Guardian Self Defense, and the group receives threat alerts from other partners, for example.\nThe cohort last week was the fourth group to train at the facility. Moving boxes still litter the office, and framed photos of two synagogue guards who were killed in attacks abroad — Dan Uzan and Yoel Kohen Ulcer — hang on a wall.\nA CSS guard shuts a door to a safe room during a drill at a synagogue in Westchester County, New York, April 28, 2025. (Luke Tress/Times of Israel)\nLocal volunteer leaders identify rank-and-file members from their community with leadership potential and refer them for the advanced training. During the three-day course, the trainees learn security skills and how to lead security teams in their communities.\nThe guards train in surveillance, questioning, intelligence, decision-making, security planning, and Krav Maga, both at the office and at synagogues in the community that lend space to CSS.\nSix men and four women attended the training session. The volunteers came from New York, Florida, California and Massachusetts. They included a college student, a retired lawyer, a Coast Guard veteran and an ex-fireman, ranging in age from their mid-20s into their 60s. Some were secular and others were Orthodox.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMost were there to learn how to guard their local synagogue, though a few of the younger volunteers were there as part of a separate CSS group, called ROAM, which dispatches young professionals to secure Jewish community events in the tri-state area.\nThe trainers included a veteran of an Israeli infantry unit with around 15 years of post-army experience securing Israeli diplomats and consulates, and Chuck Berkowitz, a former senior detective for the New York City Police Department.\nOne of the trainees, a woman in her 20s from New York, said she had joined ROAM after looking for community security programs following October 7.\n“It feels like I’m making a tangible difference,” she said. “You can go to bed knowing that there was a Jewish event that did not get blown up, that was protected, was safe.”\n“That’s felt more constructive for me than getting stuck in my head, thinking how much the world hates us. You can do something,” she added.\nCSS volunteers practice security questioning at a synagogue in Westchester County, New York, April 28, 2025. (Luke Tress/Times of Israel)\nAt the start, the group trained in “red teaming” — getting in the head of a bad actor to probe their own vulnerabilities.\n“We’re going to think like an attacker. We’re going to try to put ourselves in their shoes, in terms of operational planning, so we can deter and detect and disrupt them,” one of the trainers said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe street surveillance drill was not meant to train the guards in doing surveillance, but to teach them how it feels to do “hostile reconnaissance” in a live environment, the kind of surveillance a would-be attacker might perform while on a synagogue. The experience is meant to help the trainees identify bad actors carrying out surveillance, the instructors said.\nEach group was assigned a target — one of the trainers — and instructed to observe them without being caught, take notes about their movements, and look for patterns. Berkowitz led the drill, which was coordinated with local law enforcement.\nIn the next exercise, a CSS intelligence staffer trained the group in open-source intelligence techniques. Trainees were made aware of their own online exposure and vulnerabilities.\nThe guards also practiced questioning, with some volunteers role-playing while others questioned them. The drill trained the guards to identify suspicious behaviors, to learn access control and effective screening.\nA CSS volunteer prepares for a mock attack on his colleagues during a training session at a synagogue in Westchester County, New York, April 28, 2025. (Luke Tress/Times of Israel)\nThe guards left the facility to train emergency responses at a local synagogue. The trainers separated them into two groups — one charged with protecting the synagogue, and the other role-playing as bystanders or attackers. The trainers laid out a scenario for that group to surprise the guards. The instructor repeatedly told the guards to act with urgency, to practice going “from zero to 100 in a split second.”\n“I need you to take control of a situation,” he said. “It’s a mental change you need to work on.”\n“Every time I go on shift, I’m thinking, ‘Today something is going to happen,'” Priem told the group.\nIn one scenario, the guards questioned the role-playing community members as they lined up at the synagogue door. One of the entrants told a guard, “I saw something weird by the bushes,” where the trainers had stashed a fake explosive wrapped in cloth. The guard told his associates via radio that he was going to check. After he left his post, a shooter with a fake gun emerged from behind a cherry blossom tree bursting with pink flowers, opened fire, then retreated. Two people dropped to the ground, wounded.\n“Lockdown, lockdown. Active shooter,” the guard said into his radio. Another guard slammed the synagogue door shut.\nAfter the exercise, the instructors debriefed the participants, giving them pointers on how they could have responded more effectively.\nA downed “attacker” during a CSS security drill at a synagogue in Westchester County, New York, April 28, 2025. (Luke Tress/Times of Israel)\nAntisemitism has spiked in the US and internationally in recent years, and in the US, authorities have foiled repeated attack attempts on Jewish communities.\nIn the past year, authorities arrested a suspect who threatened a New York synagogue, after receiving a tip from the Community Security Initiative; detained an armed man in Florida for planning an attack on the American Israel Public Affairs Committee; arrested a college student who planned a terror attack on the Israeli consulate in New York City; detained a suspect in Canada who was attempting to enter the US to attack a Jewish center in Brooklyn; and indicted a neo-Nazi for planning to distribute poisoned candy to children at Jewish schools in New York.\nCSS and other security groups have proven their worth in recent years. In 2022, a CSS volunteer noticed a threat on social media and sent the information to CSI, which sent the threat to law enforcement. Police arrested a pair of suspects armed with a knife, a handgun and a Nazi armband.\nA year earlier, volunteers in the Bronx pursued and snapped a photo of a suspect who had carried out a string of vandalism against Jewish institutions in the area, leading to his arrest. In 2023, in Washington, DC, volunteer guards blocked an assailant who attempted to attack congregants with a foul-smelling spray outside a synagogue while shouting “Gas the Jews.”\nPolice officers stand watch outside the United Synagogue of Hoboken, New Jersey, Thursday, November 3, 2022, after the FBI warned of a ‘broad threat’ to Jewish places of worship in the state. (AP/Ryan Kryska)\nIn other incidents, volunteers have screened out protesters from attending Jewish events, preventing disruptions and allowing the events to go forward.\nPriem said volunteers have reported around 200-300 suspicious incidents a year in recent years. Around half of those incidents are referred to law enforcement for investigation.\nSynagogues use volunteers because hiring security is expensive, and some government security grants that are already onerous to obtain offer only limited funding for guards. CSS also says that volunteers are familiar with their synagogue’s members and culture, so are better able to spot outsiders or suspicious behaviors. In some states, strict laws regulate police interactions with the public, such as prohibitions on any kind of profiling, rules that do not apply to volunteers.\nAccording to Priem, another benefit to using volunteers is that they will be able to continue their work on their own should funding dry up altogether.\n“My feeling, especially the time that we live right now, I feel that I am part of a big family and I’m protecting that family,” said a volunteer who does up to six shifts a week at his New York synagogue. “There is a feeling of belonging and giving back to the community.”"}

But she asserts that she is not letting it affect her.\n“I’m 100 percent focused on the music, I’m 100 percent focused on my song,” Raphael told The Times of Israel in a sit-down interview last month in south Tel Aviv. “There are things that I can control and things that I can’t control. Ultimately, there’s no point investing energy in something I can’t control… the most important thing to me is to bring honor to my country and do the best I can.”\nThe 24-year-old from Ra’anana was unknown in Israel until she won the “Hakochav Haba” (Rising Star) reality TV contest earlier this year, awarding her the honor of representing Israel at the Eurovision.\nThe win marked an unthinkable milestone for a singer who a little over a year earlier had barely escaped the Hamas massacre at the Nova music festival near the Gaza border on October 7, 2023, hiding for hours under dead bodies inside a bomb shelter until she was finally rescued.\nThere’s little doubt that Raphael – who will bring her powerhouse vocals to the haunting ballad “New Day Will Rise” in Basel – won the Israeli public’s heart in part due to her unimaginable story of survival.\nBut amid the controversy of Israel’s participation in the contest and the Eurovision organizers’ insistence that the contest be free from even a hint of geopolitics, the Israeli delegation is being exceptionally careful not to connect Raphael’s experience to her performance, nor the song itself to the October 7 attack or the ongoing war. (Israel was forced to rewrite last year’s song when it was deemed too political.)\nReporters were told not to ask the singer about anything political, nor to request she recount her horrifying experience at Nova.\nBack in January, before she’d been selected to compete at the Eurovision, Raphael said in an interview that her near-death experience pushed her to pursue a musical career and to audition for the reality competition, after years of fearing she wasn’t good enough.\n“I went through a situation of death and I flipped it to start living the life I want, as much as possible,” she told Israel Hayom at the time. “When I was there [in the bomb shelter] I realized that everything could be over in a moment, and you don’t want your life to end without experiencing it. Suddenly the fear of failure was no longer a fear but a privilege.”\nAsked in April about her decision to pursue music for the first time after surviving the massacre, Raphael avoided drawing a link.\n“I wanted it my whole life, I dreamed of being a singer and an actress my whole life,” she told The Times of Israel. “True, I was very afraid and I always kept it behind closed doors. But even behind closed doors I always imagined myself on a huge stage or at my own concert.”\nThis year, said Raphael, “I felt like I really want to give my dreams a chance. To go and do what I love most in the world, and that’s to sing.”\nWhile she still fears failure, she said, she told herself that “there are always fears, particularly if it’s something we want to achieve, there’s always a fear of failure. But I realized that I don’t need to stop being afraid in order to try something.”\nYuval Raphael is crowned the winner of ‘Hakochav Haba’ on January 23, 2025, and will represent Israel at the 2025 Eurovision. (Ortal Dahan Ziv)\n“New Day Will Rise” is the first song Raphael has recorded professionally, written by Keren Peles. The lyrics are chiefly in English, with some French sprinkled in and a Hebrew line taken from the Song of Songs. The chorus – “New day will rise, life will go on/ Everyone cries, don’t cry alone/ Darkness will fade, all the pain will go by/ But wе will stay, even if you say goodbye” – has been widely interpreted within Israel as a reference to overcoming the devastation of October 7 and the ensuing war, but officially the song is simply about “hope for better days,” according to Israel’s Kan public broadcaster.\n“From the first moment I heard the song, I felt that it was sending exactly the message I wanted to send,” said Raphael. The line that stuck out to her the most, she said, was “Everyone cries; don’t cry alone.”\n“We all go through hardship,” she said. “We all go through ups and downs in life, and I think that one of the most beautiful things is to deal with it together, to support each other… I hope the message I can send to the world is [one of] hope and unity and love and support.”\nFrom Geneva to Nova to Basel\nBorn in Pedaya, a central Israel moshav, in 2000 Raphael and her family moved to Geneva, Switzerland, when she was 6, and stayed there for three years. That makes the upcoming trip to Basel a homecoming of sorts for the young singer.\nThe French passage in “New Day Will Rise” nods at her connection to Switzerland, as well as to Eurovision’s second official language.\n“[Switzerland] holds a really, really big place in my heart,” she said. “It was my home as a child… it was three short years but three very significant years.” For those few years, she said, “I would think and dream in French… it was my primary language.”\nYuval Raphael, Israel’s Eurovision 2025 representative and survivor of the Hamas Oct. 7 attack on the Nova festival, speaks to the media in Tel Aviv, March 9, 2025. (AP/Ohad Zwigenberg)\nUpon returning, she and her family settled in Ra’anana, a well-to-do town north of Tel Aviv, where she grew up, focusing her high school studies on theater and dance. After graduating, she completed her mandatory military service, stationed at security checkpoints around Jerusalem.\nOn October 7, 2023, Raphael attended the Nova music festival near the Gaza border with friends. When Hamas began firing rockets out of Gaza at 6:29 a.m., she and a friend fled via car, but found their way blocked by an endless line of vehicles. With rockets screaming ceaselessly over the south, they decided to seek safety in a roadside bomb shelter not far from Kibbutz Be’eri.\nAt 7 a.m., a group of Hamas terrorists found the shelter and opened fire on the dozens of partygoers huddled inside, killing many of them, and wounding Raphael, who had shrapnel lodged in her leg.\n“They shot everyone that was in the pathway, and then they came inside and they started shooting everyone inside,” she recounted in a video interview with the Jerusalem Institute of Justice in July 2024. “I looked to my friends, they were alive, and then I looked to my left to the girl that was holding my hand, she was lifeless, she was dead… I looked at my leg and I had this dead body all over my leg.”\nThe roadside bomb shelter where Yuval Raphael hid for hours after fleeing the Nova festival on October 7, seen on May 13, 2024. (Yossi Aloni/Flash90)\nShe called her father, who urged Raphael to play dead, which she did, throughout the hours and hours in which successive groups of terrorists showed up and opened fire on whoever was left inside, trying to ensure nobody would make it out alive.\n“I started asking myself when is this going to end, is this going to end, am I going to die?” she said last year. Later, the terrorists threw grenades inside the shelter: “Every time I opened my eyes, I could see there’s less and less people and I didn’t understand… but now, like, [I realized that] it was because people exploded.”\nUltimately, after eight hours, she was rescued by the father of another partygoer inside the shelter and handed off to Israel Defense Forces troops: “I had to step on top of the dead bodies. I looked up and I saw daylight.”\nAn ambassador of music\nA week after the attack, Raphael did her first interview with Israeli media about her experiences. Within a few months, she was speaking around the world and telling her story, including at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.\nIn Basel, Raphael is taking on a different ambassadorial role, representing Israel musically and trying to share a message of harmony.\n“I feel an immense privilege to represent my country,” she said. “It’s a huge honor and a great privilege. What I want most is to bring them as much pride as possible – I want to give the best performance I can, to reach my maximum in order to bring as much honor as I can, and I feel a huge privilege to do so through music, something that is a universal language… that is so positive and enlightening.”\nYuval Raphael, winner of ‘The Next Star’ and Israel’s 2025 Eurovision contestant, speaks to the media after her win in Neve Ilan, near Jerusalem, January 22, 2025. (Oren Ben Hakoon/Flash90)\nRaphael will take the stage near the end of the second semifinal on May 15, hoping to win one of 10 spots to advance to the final two days later.\nOddsmakers have her positioned in fifth place, a prediction that most analysts believe is driven more by pro-Israel sympathy than the music. Last year, a swell of pro-Israel voters pushed Eden Golan and her ditty “Hurricane” to second place in the public vote and fifth overall in the contest.\n“I get messages from around the world,” said Raphael. “Support from Switzerland and support from many other places, there’s an outpouring of love, and it warms my heart to receive it,” she said, noting also reaction videos posted online where people “are crying and emotional from the song and connected to the lyrics.”\nBut she knows she will also face a tide of Israel critics rooting for her to fail. Ahead of last year’s competition, many artists and participating public broadcasters called for Israel to be barred over its war against Hamas in Gaza, pointing in part to the suspension of Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, but the European Broadcasting Union rejected the comparison and said Israel would be allowed to compete.\nPeople protest at an anti-Israel rally ahead of the second semifinal at the Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo, Sweden, May 9, 2024. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner)\nSimilar sentiments abound this year, with the Spanish public broadcaster calling for Israel’s inclusion to be “debated” and thousands signing a petition in Finland demanding the Jewish state be banned from the contest. In a change to the longstanding practice of banning flags from non-competing countries, spectators this year will be allowed to wave any flags not banned by Swiss law — which includes the Palestinian flag — in the arena during the contest.\nRaphael dismissed the predictable torrent of online hate aimed at her as “background noise,” repeating that she is “so, so focused on this thing, that I feel like nothing can throw me off.”\nHer team, she said, “is handling everything that needs to be handled so that I can be 100% focused on what matters most. Ultimately we’re coming to sing, we’re coming to open our hearts.”\nLast year, Golan — who will return this year to award Israel’s jury points during the live grand final on May 17 — faced loud boos during her performance and was largely confined to her hotel room due to threats against her and the Israeli delegation.\nRaphael said she has talked with Golan about what to expect at the contest and how to deal with the unparalleled experience.\n“We’ve spoken, mostly because it was nice for me to have another person who can share with me the same feelings of preparing for this year and being 100% in it,” she said. “It’s nice to talk with someone who experienced the same thing and knows what it is to invest 100% of yourself.”\nEden Golan (left) and Yuval Raphael record a joint version of ‘Hurricane’ in March 2025. (Timor Elmalach/Kan)\nThroughout the interview, Raphael stayed on message, responding to questions about anti-Israel provocations or calls for boycotts by saying that she is only focused on the music. But asked if she had any final thoughts, she answered straight away:\n“I want to say that what is really, really important to me is the hostages,” she said. “They should have already been home a long time ago, and they need to be returned home now.”"}

She will compete in the second semifinal of the show next Thursday evening, with the emotional power ballad “New Day Will Rise.”\nThe signatories to the letter accuse Kan, Israel’s public broadcaster and an EBU member, of being “complicit in Israel’s genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza and the decades-long regime of apartheid and military occupation against the entire Palestinian people.”\nIn a statement to The Times of Israel, Martin Green, the director of the competition, said that while the EBU understands “the concerns and deeply held views,” its goal is to maintain “a universal event that promotes connections, diversity and inclusion through music.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nGreen added that its members are public broadcasters, not governments, that the EBU has consistently supported Kan “against the threat from being privatized or shut down by the Israeli government,” and that its position to include Israel is “aligned with other international organizations.”\nKan did not directly respond to the letter.\nA sign for the Eurovision Song Contest is seen on the St. Jakobshalle arena that will host the 2025 edition of the competition, April 30, 2025. (Fabrice Coffrini/AFP)\nIt was signed by more than 70 past participants from 12 countries, although that figure includes a number of backup singers, songwriters and dancers. The signatories include three past winners — Portugal’s Salvador Sobral, who won in 2017, Charlie McGettigan, who won for Ireland in 1994 and Fernando Tordo, who won in 1973 representing Portugal.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSome of the signatories came from Bosnia and Herzegovina, which hasn’t participated since 2016, and Turkey, which dropped out of the contest in 2013. Only one contestant from last year, Norway’s Gate, signed the letter, as did the UK’s Mae Muller, who competed in 2023 and is Jewish.\n“Last year, we were appalled that the EBU allowed Israel to participate while it continued its genocide in Gaza,” the letter reads, calling the 2024 contest “the most politicized, chaotic and unpleasant in the competition’s history.”\nIsrael accused a number of fellow competitors of bullying and ostracizing Eden Golan during last year’s show, while several contestants flung similar complaints back at members of Israel’s delegation. Large protests were held outside the arena in Malmo, and security was unusually high. Conspiracy theorists have tried to blame Israel for the disqualification of the Netherlands’ Joost Klein, but the EBU has maintained there was no connection.\nThe letter also points to the exclusion of Russia from the competition after its invasion of Ukraine, claiming a “double standard” when it comes to Israel.\nThe EBU has repeatedly rejected the comparison, pointing out that Russia was excluded after its public broadcaster violated the organization’s guidelines and its independence as a public media outlet.\nEden Golan of Israel performs the song ‘Hurricane’ during the second semifinal at the Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo, Sweden, May 9, 2024. (AP/Martin Meissner)\nFor decades, the Eurovision has positioned itself as a non-political contest, but geopolitics has undeniably filtered into the proceedings most years. This year, public broadcasters from Slovenia, Spain and Iceland have called on the EBU to reconsider Israel’s participation, to no avail.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe EBU unveiled a strict new code of conduct ahead of this year’s competition, barring contestants and anyone accredited to take part in the event from any public political comments as well as from bullying or harassment of other competitors.\nWith just days until the official Eurovision events kick off, contestants from all 37 countries have begun rehearsing for the show, descending on the arena in Basel.\nAfter months of silence, Israel teased some details of Raphael’s slated performance, noting that she will be alone on stage, with no backup dancers, dressed in all black and positioned next to an enormous climbable chandelier.\nThe staging will also include a balcony that Kan said is meant to be a “symbolic nod” to the famous image of Zionist visionary Theodor Herzl looking out from a balcony in — where else — Basel, Switzerland, during the Fifth Zionist Congress in 1901.\n“Everyone around us can do whatever they want, and to protest, we’re focused on the song, on Yuval’s moving performance,” said Yoav Tzafir, the head of Israel’s delegation and the director, in a video statement released by Kan on Tuesday. “The first rehearsal was wonderful, we’re proud of her.”\nRaphael, a survivor of the Hamas massacre at the Nova rave outside Gaza on October 7, 2023, is slotted for the second semifinal of the competition, on May 15, and is considered a shoe-in to advance to the grand final on May 17.\nLast year, Israel finished in fifth place overall, and the Jewish state has won the competition four times — in 2018 with Netta Barzilai’s “Toy,” in 1998 with Dana International’s “Diva,” and back-to-back wins in 1978 and 1979 with “A-Ba-Ni-Bi” and “Hallelujah.”"}

We will stop being afraid of the word ‘occupation,'” Smotrich told Channel 12 journalist Amit Segal during a conference organized by the right-wing Besheva newspaper.\n00:00 / 00:00\n“We are finally taking control of all humanitarian aid, so that it does not become supplies for Hamas.

(Israel Defense Forces)\nThe goal of the renewed Israeli offensive against Hamas is “the complete occupation of the Strip,” Culture Minister Miki Zohar told national broadcaster Kan. “Such a move endangers those who remain in captivity,” the Likud politician acknowledged. “But there is no choice left.”\nZohar, who unlike Smotrich is not a member of the key security cabinet, argued that the war has taken over a year and a half “because we wanted to bring as many hostages home as possible,” adding that the renewed offensive could bring Hamas to the table in a serious way. “Hamas may soon realize that it has no choice but to return [the hostages] and exile itself from Gaza,” he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe plan that the cabinet approved on Sunday also involved overhauling the distribution of humanitarian aid in the Strip, in a bid to prevent Hamas from controlling the goods. The proposal, which has been vaguely outlined by officials, was condemned by the terror group, and drew criticism from various international organs.\nThe Hostage and Missing Families Forum on Monday accused the government of “choosing territory over hostages,” and noted that “this is against the will of over 70 percent of the people.”\nPolls have consistently shown that a large majority of the Israeli public favors a deal that would see all the hostages held in Gaza released, even if it means ending the war.\n“The plan approved by the cabinet deserves the name ‘Smotrich-Netanyahu Plan’ for giving up on the hostages and its abandonment of national and security resilience,” the forum said.\nThroughout the fighting, Smotrich and others on the far right have urged using the war as an opportunity to reestablish Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip, which existed until a unilateral withdrawal in 2005.\nFamilies of those held hostage in the Gaza Strip and activists protest at the Knesset in Jerusalem, May 5, 2025. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nAt the Knesset on Monday, Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, lashed out at coalition lawmakers, shouting: “I want to know what the hell you’re thinking, doing this,” and called on reservists not to show up to duty.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The cabinet decided to send heroic soldiers to an operation that will result in the murder of hostages in captivity, and the loss of soldiers,” she added. “You think the nation will take this in silence?”\nZangauker noted the call-up of tens of thousands of reserve soldiers in recent days, in advance of the expanded operation. “Yesterday a mother of soldiers who were called up to reserves asked me what she should say to them. How should I have answered her?”\nLikud MK Simcha Rothman responded, “I would tell her that of course they should go. I recommend we be careful here about calls for refusal.”\nThe comment infuriated Zangauker, who responded, “I’m not calling for refusal! Don’t put words in my mouth, I said not to show up to reserves for moral and ethical reasons!” She also noted that her daughter serves in the reserves.\nעינב צנגאוקר מול רוטמן קראה בועדת חוקה לא להתייצב למילואים מטעמים מוסריים ויצאה מהדיון: \"אתה לא תדביק לי סרבנות, מתן שירת בצבא, נטלי חיילת בצבא ההגנה לישראל\" pic.twitter.com/y0bejC6A7p\n— לירי בורק שביט (@lirishavit) May 5, 2025\nHannah Cohen, the aunt of slain hostage Inbar Haiman, whose remains are still held by Hamas, said: “People say ‘we’ll get them back in coffins,’ and I tell them that even in coffins we won’t get them back.

Noa was slated to start a master’s degree program this fall and Gidi was the founder of “Radio Berlin,” which organized parties and raves in Tel Aviv with international DJs.\nTheir aunt, Tzviya Chiell, told Ynet news that “despite their age gap they were very close to each other. They both loved music festivals and went down there with friends to the party.”\nTzivya said the murders of Noa and Gideon “have left the family destroyed.” She noted that both of the siblings had a tattoo in Hebrew that read, “There’s no such thing as impossible,” something that was written on the gravestone of their grandfather.\nSeveral members of the family have since gotten the same tattoo on their arm to memorialize the slain siblings.\nThat sentence, she said, has become like a last will and testament for the family: “We will break and we will rise again, break and rise again, until we rise, because there is no such thing as impossible.”\nGideon’s girlfriend, Alina Vorko, wrote on Instagram about how they recently moved in together but would never get to experience so many things together.\n“We never got to slouch on the sofa and watch a movie. We never got to prepare a normal dinner together, to listen to music, to dance and be happy, just you and me,” she wrote. “We worked so hard on our home together, but we never got to start our lives together like we wanted and planned.”\n“You taught me how to live, what it is to really live, I changed so much thanks to you, you made me a better person from day to day,” Vorko added. “I couldn’t have asked for a more perfect person than you. You are the first and forever love of my life, true unconditional love with no boundary — the universe gave me too good of a gift, and took it away too quickly.”\nNoa’s roommate, Lior Shemesh, eulogized her on social media, writing, “My Noa, my sister, who always stood by me, was first to arrive when I needed her, whether my heart was broken or if I just didn’t want to drive to work alone.”\n“My Noa, a role model, keeper of secrets, partner in nonsense, in dancing, a true unconditional friend… I love you my Noa, I will miss you forever.”\nTheir younger brother, Harel, wrote on Instagram about his relationship with each of his slain siblings.\n“My Noa’le… I miss your voice so much, I keep asking myself where you are so that you’ll come and annoy me like you loved so much… come and embarrass me like always,” he wrote.\n“You don’t understand how much I miss you and Gidi. I feel empty, lacking, it’s so hard,” wrote Harel. “Please come and annoy me, even just a little, even just one more time.”\nTo Gidi, Harel wrote, “Since I was a kid you accompanied me and taught me everything, there are not a lot of big brothers like that… I miss our conversations where we would sit at the coffee bar on the balcony or just on the phone and you would tell me about your dreams, and ask me how I was.”\n“I was so proud of you and would say everywhere I went how much of a champion you were, everyone I met I would ask them if they knew ‘Radio Berlin,'” Harel recalled. “You’re my role model and always will be, and I admire you on levels I don’t think anyone will understand.”\n“The amount of things you accomplished was unbelievable, to you sleep was just a recommendation,” Harel added. “You proved to the world that ‘there is no such thing as impossible’… whenever things are hard I tell myself that Gidi would never give up, and would prove to everyone that ‘there is no such thing as impossible.'”\nRead more Those We Have Lost articles here."}

You helped me with everything… send me strength to live, to be happy, to make jokes the way only you knew how… I’ll miss everything — the hug you would give me, the way you said you would always love me, always.”\nShe said that just a day before he was killed, “when I was in school they told me that my dad was coming to visit.

He was one of several security guards at the Re’im-area Nova music festival who saved festival-goers’ lives when the terrorists attacked.\nBraslavski, who was working while on break from the military, brought two young women to safety, was wounded in both hands and continued trying to save others, despite having the opportunity to escape, according to survivors who saw him. He was last seen in the early afternoon, several hours into the attack, helping a young woman out of a garbage container where she was hiding.\nRom Braslavski was taken captive by Hamas terrorists on October 7, 2023 from the Supernova rave (Courtesy)\n“That fits,” his father told Haaretz recently. “He’s always thinking of others. A good kid. Heart of gold.”\nThere had been no information regarding Braslavski’s fate until March 6, 2025, 517 days into his captivity, when returned hostage Sasha Troufanov said he and Braslavski had briefly been held together.\nSpeaking to the Walla news site last month, Braslavski’s mother Tami said her son was injured in his hand when he was abducted and suffers from an allergy that could cause shortness of breath.\nNimrod Cohen\nNimrod Cohen, 20, is an IDF soldier from Rehovot. He has a twin sister and an older brother.\nHis mother, Vicky, describes him as sensitive and quiet, with a huge heart.\nCohen and his tank crew were abducted as they fought Hamas terrorists who had infiltrated the Nahal Oz base.

Omer Neutra, the commander.\nThe IDF has confirmed the deaths of Dahan, Daniel and Neutra, but there have been several signs of life from Cohen.\nHe was most recently spotted in a video Hamas published March 1 of released hostage Iair Horn parting with his brother Eitan, who remains in captivity.\nNimrod Cohen was taken captive by Hamas terrorists to Gaza on October 7, 2023 (Courtesy)\nThough Cohen’s face was blurred in the video, his family recognized him by the tattoo on his forearm. In the video, Cohen could be seen walking.\nHis mother told The Times of Israel last month that a returning hostage reported seeing Cohen alive, though in poor physical and mental shape, some eight months ago.\nCohen’s father told Channel 12 in February that a recently returned hostage conveyed a message from his son: “I’m okay. Don’t worry. Love you.”\nAriel Cunio\nAriel Cunio, 27, is one of four brothers born and raised in Nir Oz. He was kidnapped along with his long-time girlfriend Arbel Yehoud — who was released on January 30 — from their home in the kibbutz.

The two met in kindergarten and served in the army together.\nOn February 22, Hamas published a propaganda video showing David and Gilboa-Dalal forced to watch as other captives were freed. The two friends, gaunt with buzzed hair, could be seen begging to be saved.\nThe video was the first public sign of life from David since his abduction.\nHis sister Yeela wrote on Instagram that the video showed Hamas “monsters” had put her brother and his friend “in the most horrifying and evil situation there could be.”\n“There is no limit to the messed-up cynicism of these monsters,” she wrote.\nEvyatar David, then 22, was kidnapped by Hamas from the Re’im-area Nova music festival on October 7, 2023.

{"title": "Hostage Forum publishes health report for 24 living hostages, warns ‘time is running out’", "date": "8 April 2025, 2:16 pm", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/hostage-forum-publishes-health-report-for-24-living-hostages-warns-time-is-running-out/", "type": "article", "content": "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum published on Monday a medical report detailing the condition of the living hostages still held captive in Gaza, based on known medical conditions and injuries, propaganda videos published by Hamas, and testimonies from those released during the recent two-month ceasefire.\nThe report, which the forum stressed did not provide a full depiction of the hostages’ health, examined both their physical and mental state. It warned that some have been isolated for the majority of their 550 days in captivity, increasing the chances of severe psychological distress, and that many of them were likely suffering from digestive problems, prolonged dehydration and serious infections.\nFifty-eight of the 251 hostages seized during the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, onslaught remain in the clutches of Gazan terror groups. Hamas is also holding the body of a soldier killed during the 2014 Gaza war, bringing the total number of captives to 59. Of that number, 24 are thought to be alive.\nThe testimonies from hostages released during the recent ceasefire from mid-January to early March reveal proof of “severe shortages of food, water and medical care, leading to malnutrition, severe weakness and the deterioration of their health,” the forum said.\nOn top of that, they are undergoing “physical and mental torture,” it said,  including “strangulation, being tied up, being hung by the legs, burns and deliberate starvation.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nSome of the hostages are chained up, “for weeks or months at a time,” and they are all being held in tunnels underground “without natural light and air,” the report said.\nImages of those held captive in Gaza are displayed at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, on March 31, 2025. (Miriam Alster/FLASH90)\n“Captivity survivors held for long periods of time described conditions of complete isolation, with no contact with other Israelis, or knowledge of their loved ones’ conditions,” the forum said.\n“Many suffered from severe malnutrition and deteriorating health due to the lack of proper medical care. Some battled serious infections or illnesses without any access to medical care, and sometimes remained wounded, without bandages or painkillers.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsrael has received proof of life for 20 of the 24 hostages since the start of the war, the forum said, but information about their health is still lacking. Of the remaining four, it said “concerns for their safety are growing.”\nThe remaining captives are a mix of soldiers and civilian men — many of whom are treated by Hamas as soldiers because they are still within the age range eligible for IDF reserve service.\nReturned hostages have recounted experiencing “particularly severe torture” if their captors determined that they were IDF soldiers or other “key figures,” the forum said. Many of them were subjected to “prolonged isolation, sleep deprivation and frequent beatings.”\nPhysical condition of the hostages\nThe report noted that at least five of the living hostages had pre-existing health conditions, including asthma, allergies and skin diseases.\nAt least eight are suffering from physical injuries, it said, including burns, infections, and injuries to the eyes and nose.\nAll 24 are suffering from malnutrition, it said, and many have lost drastic amounts of weight.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Additional evidence suggests that some of the hostages frequently suffer from vomiting and diarrhea, symptoms that indicate severe digestive problems and a risk of dehydration.”\n“This distress is likely due to the complete lack of sanitation, poor nutrition and undrinkable water,” the report stated.\nDeclining mental health\nAll 24 of the living hostages are suffering from “serious psychological disorders,” the forum said, “including anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.”\nIt noted that, in addition to being held alone for long periods, some of the hostages were separated from family members snatched along with them on October 7.\n“Sleep deprivation, threats and constant intimidation are worsening their mental states,” the report summarized.\nPeople protest against the Israeli government and call for the immediate release of the Gaza hostages, Tel Aviv, March 22, 2025. (Gili Yaari /Flash90)\nThe report also provided an overview of the health of most of the living hostages, based on testimonies shared with their families, statements from released hostages and videos released by Hamas.\nIt noted that it only published information on individual hostages with the express permission of their families. As such, several hostages were not named in the report.\nAlon Ohel\nThe forum said Alon Ohel, who was abducted from the Nova music festival, is suffering from eye injuries, leaving him with limited vision, and a risk of losing sight in his second eye as well. He is being held alone, chained up and with a severe lack of food, it said.

He has been regularly beaten by his captors.\nThe forum said that testimonies received by his family indicate that his mental and physical health have significantly deteriorated.\nEitan Horn\nEitan Horn was left behind in Gaza when his brother Yair was released during the recent ceasefire. A video released of him last month showed him to be in “very poor physical condition,” the forum said. “His body is thin, his movements are heavy, and he is suffering from open blisters and severe infections in his hands.”\nHorn suffers from a chronic skin disease, which is being worsened by the lack of medical treatment, it said.\nSegev Kalfon\nSegev Kalfon suffers from pre-existing medical conditions, including generalized anxiety disorder, the forum said, and underwent an operation on his leg not long before October 7. It said testimonies have indicated he is being kept in chains and is suffering from a lack of food.\nNimrod Cohen\nNimrod Cohen is the sole survivor of his tank squad which was attacked on October 7, and was abducted after witnessing the murder of his fellow tank operatives, the forum said. Freed hostages have said he is depressed and doesn’t speak much. He is suffering from an untreated ear infection and a skin rash caused by unsanitary conditions.\nBar Abraham Kuperstein\nThe forum said that it is lacking clear information about the health of Bar Abraham Kuperstein, but that in a video released earlier this month, he was “exhausted, angry, and perhaps even showing signs of despair, but his speech is clear, coherent, and logical.”\nAriel Cunio\nNo proof of life has been received from Ariel Cunio since he was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz along with his partner Arbel Yehud, who was released in January, the forum said.\nFormer hostage Yarden Bibas, center, holds posters calling for the release of David and Ariel Cunio, at Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, March 18, 2025.

The forum said that his mental health is likely to have deteriorated since he was separated from other hostages.\nEitan Mor\nNot much is known about the health of Eitan Mor, who was abducted from the Nova music festival. Released hostages have provided his family with proof of life, but did not have more information.\nEitan Mor was serving as an unarmed security guard at the Supernova desert rave on October 7, 2023, when Hamas terrorists attacked (Courtesy)\nTamir Nimrodi\nThe family of 20-year-old Tamir Nimrodi hasn’t received any proof of life since October 7, 2023, when a video surfaced of his abduction from an IDF base near the Erez Crossing. He was in pyjamas and without his glasses in the video. His family has said that they know he entered Gaza alive, but that then “the earth swallowed him.”\nMatan Zangauker\nMatan Zangauker was seen in a Hamas propaganda video in December 2024, in which he described the harsh conditions of his captivity. The forum said he appeared “pale and thin, with clear signs of exhaustion.”\n‘Time is running out’\n“As time passes, concern grows that their physical and mental state is much more severe than can be estimated,” the forum said of the 24 living hostages.\n“The information collected paints a very worrying picture: The hostages are being held in inhumane conditions, suffering severe physical and mental abuse, and their health and mental states are rapidly deteriorating,” it said. “Time is running out, and every additional moment in captivity puts their lives in terrible danger.”\nSummarizing its findings, the forum said that “every additional day in captivity is a potential death sentence for them. This death would be a ‘preventable death,’ meaning a death that could have been avoided through proper intervention.”\n“The date in this report leaves no room for doubt — time is running out,” the four said. “Urgent action must be taken to bring them back before it is too late.”"}

Horovitz notes that the language used by both the government and army is not clear with regard to the plans for future fighting in Gaza. That, along with an unpredictable US administration, he says, makes it hard to know how the imminent expanded IDF operation will unfold.\nHorovitz also offers a brief look at the cabinet decision against establishing a state commission to probe October 7, even after the attorney general had recommended it. He notes the primary concern behind the imperative for a powerhouse state inquiry: to ensure that a disaster of this kind will never happen again. He also highlights the importance of the credibility and independence of Israel’s judiciary, in the wider context of Israel’s capacity to defend itself against international allegations relating to its conduct of the war.\nFinally, Horovitz comments on remarks made by US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff at an Israel Independence Day event at the US Embassy in Washington, DC.

Three have died,” without providing additional details.\nAsked whether Israel was disappointed in Trump’s commenting on the sensitive issue and contradicting Israel’s official number at the time, the PMO told The Times of Israel: “We very much welcome President Trump’s and the American people’s commitment to the security and the safety and the ongoing future of this country. We see eye to eye in every single way. There is no daylight between our two governments because we coordinate all of our actions together.”\nTrump’s comments sent shockwaves through the families of the hostages, who demanded on Wednesday that they be provided with any updated intelligence on their loved ones.\nAmid the resurgent worry over the hostages’ status, Haaretz also revealed Wednesday that in a military document outlining plans for a new Gaza offensive, the IDF had ranked the return of the hostages as its least important objective.\nThe document, presented to commanders on Tuesday, placed the Hamas-held captives in sixth and last place, a fact incongruent with army officials’ previous assertions to the Israeli public that the return of the hostages was the IDF’s most important war goal.\nADVERTISEMENT\nProtesters in Habima Square in Tel Aviv on May 3, 2025, call for elections now and for the release of all the hostages.

We are saying, take this deal now, because if we start a war and there is a deal, it will be under far worse circumstances for you. Take the deal, because now there is an opportunity, a window.”\nAsked to what extent Trump’s upcoming Middle East visit will influence Israel’s military and strategic plans in Gaza, the PMO told The Times of Israel on Thursday that “Washington DC and Jerusalem are working side by side, shoulder to shoulder. We are fully coordinated, we are fully cooperating, as befits the closeness of our relationship and the shared values, and also the shared threats that we face.”\nThe PMO also said that “Israel is examining ways right now as we speak so that aid can be delivered into Gaza to get to the people that need it and not to Hamas, who steal it. We know that they use that aid to fund their terrorist operation.”"}

But Iran, which openly seeks Israel’s destruction, has ramped up its enrichment of uranium to 60 percent purity, which has no peaceful application, and has obstructed international inspectors from checking its nuclear facilities.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a warning to Iran on Tuesday after the Israeli military bombed targets belonging to the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists in Yemen for a second day, destroying the international airport in Sanaa.\n“I have said many times that whoever attacks Israel — his blood will be on his own head,” says Netanyahu, noting his promise that there would be multiple “blows” in response to a Houthi missile that struck inside the grounds of Ben Gurion International Airport on Sunday.\nHe said the choice and timing of targets was meant to punish the Houthis, but also to send a message to Iran, “without whose approval and long-term support, the Houthis could not carry out the criminal missile attack against us.”\nMissiles launched from Iran towards Israel are seen in the West Bank city of Nablus, October 1, 2024. (AP Photo/Majdi Mohammed)\nIran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel in April 2024, firing some 300 attack drones and missiles in response to the killing of several Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps members in an airstrike near Tehran’s consulate in Damascus.\nMonths later, in October, Iran launched some 200 ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for the killings of Hassan Nasrallah and Ismail Haniyeh, the leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas, respectively.\nIn both instances, the Iranian assaults were largely thwarted by Israel’s air defenses in cooperation with the US and its regional allies. Israel twice bombed Iran in response, the second time destroying much of its air defense systems as well as some rocket and drone manufacturing sites."}

That act raised eyebrows at the Vatican and was denounced by former Italian premier Romano Prodi as indecent political interference in matters of faith.\nAnd last month, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops announced the end of a half-century of partnerships with the federal US government to serve refugees and migrant children, saying the “heartbreaking” decision followed the Trump administration’s abrupt halt to funding.\nThe majority of Leo’s posts on the X platform are related to or in support of Catholic news and church initiatives. He rarely writes original content, but a look back through his social media timeline shows numerous posts sharing viewpoints opposed to moves aimed at restricting acceptance of migrants and refugees in the US.\nCriticism of Vance’s views\nVance, a convert to Catholicism, is currently the most high-profile Catholic in American politics. He’s drawn attention from the man who now leads the global church, with his views prompting Leo to return to X after a nearly two-year absence to share criticism.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nIn early February, Leo shared an article from a Catholic publication with the headline, “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others.”\nJD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others https://t.co/hDKPKuMXmu via @NCRonline\n— Robert Prevost (@drprevost) February 3, 2025\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt came days after Vance — in discussing critiques of the Trump administration’s immigration policies — in a Fox News interview had referenced a Christian tenet “that you love your family and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens, and then after that, prioritize the rest of the world.”\nIn response to online criticism of his position, Vance posted on X, “Just google ‘ordo amoris.’ Aside from that, the idea that there isn’t a hierarchy of obligations violates basic common sense.”\n“Ordo amoris,” a historic Catholic tenet, translates to “order of love.”\nTen days after his initial post, Leo shared another piece from a Jesuit publication, titled “Pope Francis’ letter, JD Vance’s ‘ordo amoris’ and what the Gospel asks of all of us on immigration.”\nPrior to his first February post, Leo had been dormant on X since July 2023.\nAfter Leo’s election Thursday, Vance posted congratulations on X, adding, ”I’m sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church. May God bless him!”\nADVERTISEMENT\nPope Leo is expected to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Pope Francis, a champion of the poor and of immigrants, who also had his differences with the Trump administration. Vance played down those differences after meeting with Francis at the Vatican the day before he died, but they were substantial. Francis had called Trump’s immigration policies a disgrace.\nPope Francis receives US Vice President JD Vance before bestowing the Urbi et Orbi (Latin for to the city and to the world) blessing at the end of the Easter mass presided over by Cardinal Angelo Comastri in St. Peter’s Square at the Vatican, April 20, 2025 (Vatican Media via AP, HO)\nThe new pope’s final post as Cardinal Robert Prevost was a recirculation on April 14 of a post by church chronicler Rocco Palmo about Trump’s Oval Office meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.\nBukele said it was “preposterous” for his country to bring a Maryland man who was wrongly deported there in March back to the US, despite a Supreme Court ruling calling on the administration to “facilitate” Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s return.\nLeo reposted Palmo’s link to an article by Washington-area Bishop Evelio Menjivar — who was born in El Salvador — asking, “Do you not see the suffering? Is your conscience not disturbed? How can you stay quiet?”\nLeo’s critiques of Trump date back nearly a decade.\nWhen Trump’s first presidential campaign ramped up in July 2015, he posted to X a Washington Post op-ed by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, with the headline, “Why Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric is so problematic.”\nIn the wake of Trump’s first election in 2016, Leo reposted a homily in which Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez — characterizing the fear among many, including schoolchildren who “think the government is going to come and deport their parents, any day now” — said that America is “better than this.”\nDays later, Leo also posted an article by a Catholic outlet quoting Democrats as saying that, in her loss, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton “ignored pro-lifers at her own peril.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nPope Francis elevates to cardinal the US prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops Robert Francis Prevost during a consistory to create 21 new cardinals at St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican on September 30, 2023.

(Tiziana Fabi/AFP)\nIn September 2017, months into Trump’s first term, Leo recirculated a post by author-activist Sister Helen Prejean saying she stands “with the #Dreamers and all people who are working toward an immigration system that is fair, just, and moral.”\nHe also reposted church chronicler Rocco Palmo’s piece with the teaser, “Saying Trump’s ‘bad hombres’ line fuels ‘racism and nativism,’ Cali bishops send preemptive blast on DACA repeal.”\nWhile many Catholics in the US welcomed the first American pope, some of Trump’s Make America Great Again movement reacted with disdain to Leo’s appointment.\n“He is anti-Trump, anti-MAGA, pro-open Borders, and a total Marxist like Pope Francis,” Loomer wrote on X.\n“Pope Leo XIV: Registered Chicago Republican and pro-life warrior OR Open borders globalist installed to counter Trump?” wrote right-wing activist Charlie Kirk."}

Throughout the semester, Carnegie Mellon University students in Andrew Stone’s second-year studio course explored architecture through human experience.\nThe monthslong undertaking involved designing a space for Jewish artist Benjamin Schwartz, a Squirrel Hill-based painter who goes by “Benny Blindspots” due to his legal blindness. Blending reality and fantasy, students were told that Schwartz’s potential studio would be located in a vacant Bloomfield lot.\nBecause the site actually exists, students were required to “work within real constraints,” Stone said. And, by repeatedly meeting with Schwartz “as if he were a real client,” students discovered how collaborative processes tailor to users’ needs.\nDuring the semester, CMU student David Tang was tasked with not only creating digital sketches and carving prototypes, but visiting Schwartz’s Squirrel Hill studio, exploring its subterranean space and speaking with the artist.\nThe takeaway, Tang said, is people interact with areas in different ways “and we don’t see that by just designing it in a room. We need to be able to experience it.”\nBenjamin Schwartz inspects a painting inside his Squirrel Hill studio. (Photo by Adam Reinherz)\nSite visits and discussions weren’t the only mechanisms for gaining better appreciation of their client. At one point during the semester, Tang and his 15 fellow classmates were blindfolded and asked to walk indoors with canes.\n“That was really hard for us to navigate. We had to think about dimensions,” Tang said. Often, when putting together a design, people fail to recognize “just the amount of steps it takes for you to get from point A to point B.”\nThe blindfolding experience, along with multiple conversations with Schwartz, elicited new awareness.\nDesigners can sometimes “over-engineer some elements,” Tang said. Spending time with a client, observing how they operate and wish to work, enables a realization of the “power a person has” and fosters greater comprehension of the “space itself.”\nFellow CMU student Miles Rainwater said the semester-long study resulted in newfound regard for revision.\n“A lot of times we rush or finish things for a deadline, and we’re kind of the only people whose hands have been on it — apart from maybe the instructor’s — but at the end of the day, the user is the most important element,” Rainwater said. Experiencing an “adaptive process” means revisiting not only “whatever your concept is,” but altering an understanding of how the “user ends up working with that product.”\nStudios observe and discuss projects inside Carnegie Mellon University’s Great Hall on April 28. Photo by Adam Reinherz’s Great Hall on April 28. (Photo by Adam Reinherz)\nMonths of exchange between Schwartz, Stone and the students culminated at CMU on April 28. Standing beside paper designs and 3D models, students pointed to sliding doors, innovative handles and creative floor plans. With Schwartz and Stone nearby, college sophomores demonstrated their work and answered questions from classmates, other CMU faculty and passersby.\nOf particular interest to Stone were documents in the corner of CMU’s Great Hall.\nThe tactile drawings with ink that “kind of swells off the page” allows users to “physically feel the plan,” he said. These drawings, which were produced with help from the Library for Accessible Media for Pennsylvanians, enable both architects and clients to experience “a simpler way to communicate.”\nBolstering connection and appreciation was integral to the course, and Schwartz was a perfect partner, Stone continued. “I wanted to teach a studio that was very kind of process-oriented.”\nWhen architects or creatives design in a shop the results aren’t exactly what’s intended. There’s a “kind of feedback loop where you have an idea in your head, you’re trying to bring it into the physical world, and there’s pushback against that because you have to deal with the material qualities or the tools that are available to you,” Stone said. “If you embrace that and go with it, it can make some really interesting designs, and that’s exactly how Benny works. He’s not one of those artists that plans out the whole painting beforehand and has a grid where he’s doing a paint-by-number type of thing. He allows himself to be immersed in the process, which is really what I’m trying to get my students to do.”\nCarnegie Mellon University’s Andrew Stone stands beside works created in his second year studio course exploring architecture through human experience. (Photo by Adam Reinherz)\nSchwartz, who throughout the semester not only spoke with students and exhibited his space but allowed visitors to watch him paint, praised the professor and his students.\n“They were clearly listening when they came and visited the studio. They addressed the needs that we had chatted about each in their own unique way,” Schwartz said. Students created “vastly different models for creating the space and finding pathways,” and as a result “I found myself, even at my own studio, rethinking my space, and I’ve made changes.”\nWhat Schwartz didn’t transform, though, was his sense of humor or identity.\nWhen students scheduled a Friday talk with Schwartz at CMU, the artist remarked he was happy to meet but that the conversation must conclude well before Shabbat began.\n“If I don’t get home before sunset, I’ll turn into a pillar of salt,” Schwartz said.\nOn a separate occasion, after observing the project’s progress, Schwartz commended the students.\n“I told them, ‘I can tell you guys are really keeping busy and actually doing work, not just going out to protest,’” he said.\nSchwartz, who grew up in Squirrel Hill and graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, said that working with Stone and the students afforded meaningful insight.\n“I’m 36, I’m starting to move off into that next generation of being fully grown, or whatever you want to call it,” he said. “Seeing the sincerity with which they approached the whole project, they didn’t make me feel like they were just there for school or for a grade — I’m sure they’re committed to getting those A’s, that’s the kind of students they are — there was genuine interest. There was genuine excitement from many of the students in terms of how they probed, and questioned and wanted to really know what they could design.”\nThe students’ passion and sensitivity for the project reflected something deeply human, Schwartz continued.\nAs architects or creatives, “you could just design this home or whatever,” he said. Instead, these students are “talking about accessibility right at the beginning of their artistic careers.”\nRiffing on his own visibility, Schwartz laughed and continued, “It opened my eyes.” PJC\nAdam Reinherz can be reached at areinherz@pittsburghjewishchronicle.org."}

In March, Hamad filed a motion to modify the conditions of his release, asking the court to lift the home detention requirement and instead impose a curfew along with the continuance of electronic monitoring. That request was denied.\nGet The Jewish Chronicle Weekly Edition by email and never miss our top stories\nFREE SIGN UP\nIn late April, the federal government announced a superseding indictment returned by a grand jury charging Hamad, Lubit and Micaiah Collins with conspiracy, defacing and damaging religious property, making false statements and possession of destructive devices.\nSeveral new pieces of information were revealed during the detention hearing, including that the FBI was concerned Hamad, a member of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard who was seeking top secret clearance, might target a military training exercise with explosives.\nHamad, the government contended, joined the National Guard to learn combat skills hoping to utilize them as a Hamas operative. The defendant, government attorneys alleged, called himself a terrorist and stole Israeli flags from community members. Hamad also allegedly said bullets should “touch the forehead of Zionists” and that he wanted to die a martyr.\nFBI Special Agent Gregory Battaglia told the court Hamad had threatened his own family members, including his parents, and that pro-Hamas videos were found on his social media accounts and in messages to friends.\nAn open question at the hearing was whether Hamad has a Lebanese passport. The FBI was unable to find one, but Hamad previously testified that one existed. He later recanted that testimony, saying he was confused and that his father handled the family’s passports.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Nicole Vasquez Schmitt said Hamad lied during his background check for the military, claiming allegiance to the United States while stating on social media he was loyal to Lebanon and Palestine. He also bragged about his ability to evade law enforcement, she said.\nDuring the hearing, prosecutors said Hamad attended the Valley View Presbyterian Church in Garfield 10 times beginning in February 2025. Hamad’s co-defendant Michaiah Collins’ father, Chad Collins, is a pastor at the church.\nWhile acknowledging that anyone can worship anywhere, Dodge called the timing of Hamad’s attendance at Valley View Church “interesting,” noting that it coincided with the delivery of subpoenas for the grand jury that ultimately led to the indictment of Hamad and his co-defendants, and an effort to have those subpoenaed resist testifying.\nSome members of the Collins family have a history of anti-Israeli activism. Chad Collins’ daughter Nesta Collins was arrested for obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct at an anti-Israeli encampment at the University of Pittsburgh last year.\nIn addition to his pastoral duties with Valley View Presbyterian Church, Chad Collins is a national organizer with Friends of Sabeel North America, an anti-Israel, pro-BDS organization. He was at the anti-Israel protest and encampment on Pitt’s campus following Israel’s response to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on the Jewish state.\nChad Collins served as a spokesperson at a press conference following the dismantling of an anti-Israel encampment.\nHe also was an organizer of the Rev. Munther Isaac’s visit to Pittsburgh last summer.\nIsaac is a Palestinian Christian pastor who was called “the high priest of antisemitic Christianity” by the Rev. Johnnie Moore, president of the Congress of Christian Leaders.\n“He spreads hate from the city of Jesus’ birth,” Moore told Jewish Insider.\nWhile in Pittsburgh, Isaac met with and was photographed with Collins, Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and Rep. Summer Lee.\nCollins also has made spurious claims, publicly stating that Jesus was Palestinian and that there are “many Palestinians who are Jewish.” He recently shared information about a fundraising event for Gainey’s reelection, writing, “Help us defeat AIPAC AGAIN!!!!!”\nNeither AIPAC nor the super PAC United Democracy Project, participates in local or state elections.\nFollowing Hamad’s detention hearing, the Chronicle contacted the Pittsburgh Presbytery, of which Valley View Presbyterian Church is a member. The presbytery provides resources, and advises and assists “members through challenges and transitions,” according to its website.\nGeneral Minister Jessia McClure Archer said in an email that the presbytery is committed to love, peace and reconciliation “for all people, across all differences.”\n“We remain committed to ecumenical and interfaith partnerships and unequivocally denounce violence and intimidation in every form, regardless of who is involved. Our faith compels us to uphold the God-given dignity of every human being and to defend the freedom of all people to worship and live without fear.”\nMcClure Archer said that a May 12 meeting between a variety of Christian and Jewish leaders and partners was being organized through the Christian Associates of Southwestern Pennsylvania.\nChristian Associates Executive Minister the Rev. Liddy Barlow said she is coordinating the meeting at the request of the presbytery, and that the meeting was being organized because it is clear “that this situation caused harm to our Jewish neighbors.”\n“I think it’s really important for the Christian community to stop and listen and to make whatever moves are possible towards repair,” Barlow said.\nWhen news of the superseding indictment was shared on social media, the Rev. Canon Natalie Hall at Church of the Redeemer in Squirrel Hill posted about the incident, writing, “Our Jewish friends and neighbors are upset and frightened for their safety. It is difficult to live in a state of constant vigilance. Members at my church are reaching out to Jewish friends, neighbors, colleagues, and acquaintances this week to check in — maybe even have a cup of coffee for conversation.”\nHall told the Chronicle it is important to stand up “for the sake of our neighbors.” She said she has spoken with many individuals who, since the arrests have come to light, “have found it possible to hold multiple difficult truths in the same space at the same time.”\n“These are not people who are going to magically go all in supporting everything the state of Israel does,” she said. “They have complicated feelings about it much the same way they all have complicated feelings about our own government. I think it’s refreshing to hear people come to understand that it’s possible to hold these multiple facets of a really complex situation in the same space and in the middle of that directly support friends, neighbors and colleagues.”\nBoth Lubit and Collins were released pending trial.\nThe Chronicle contacted both Gainey and Lee for comment but received no response from either official prior to publication.

Then, too, Rowland either denied our requests or ignored them.\nWe are seeing a pattern here, a disturbing if not dangerous one, and one that potentially disenfranchises Pittsburgh’s Jewish community.\nLast week, the Chronicle again reached out to Gainey’s staff asking to interview the mayor. We wanted to inquire about his relationship with Chad Collins, a pastor at Valley View Presbyterian Church and a national leader of FOSNA (Friends of Sabeel North America), which promotes boycotts of Israel. Some Sabeel adherents have charged Jews with deicide and “have compared Palestinians to a modern-day Jesus and accused Israel of engaging in a ‘crucifixion’ of these Palestinians,” according to the Anti-Defamation League.\nGainey posed for a photo with Collins, Summer Lee, and Sabeel’s Rev.

Hamad has identified as a “Hamas operative.” Federal filings say the government suspects that Hamad attended Chad Collins’ church.\nAnother of Chad Collins’ children, Nesta Collins, is facing criminal charges in the Allegheny Court of Commons Pleas related to violent activity last year at an anti-Israel encampment, where Chad Collins served as a spokesperson.\nIn May 2024, Collins posted on Facebook and Instagram an image that included an inverted red triangle, a symbol used by Hamas to mark military targets. That symbol was allegedly spray painted on Chabad of Squirrel Hill by Hamad and another accomplice, Talya Lubit.\nWe are concerned. Chad Collins has been actively campaigning for Gainey’s reelection. In recent pro-Gainey posts Collins wrote: “Can’t let Trump and AIPAC win our Mayoral race!!” and “Help us defeat AIPAC AGAIN!!!!!”\nIt is common knowledge that neither AIPAC, nor the super PAC United Democracy Project, participates in either state or local elections. So what, or who, did Collins mean by referring to “AIPAC”?\nWe wanted to give Gainey the opportunity to clarify his relationship with Collins or to disavow him, if appropriate.\nBut Gainey’s camp will not give Pittsburgh’s only Jewish newspaper access to our mayor.\nWe urge Gainey to make this right and speak with the Chronicle. PJC"}

Can’t wait to have fun with you,” he messaged, according to the indictment.\nOn July 4, 2024, the indictment alleges, Hamad shared a video of an apparent Hamas funeral on his Instagram story and wrote, “Ya Allah, I can’t take this anymore, I want to fight and die. I don’t want to live here anymore. I’m jealous of these fighters, they got to fight in the way of Allah and have achieved the highest level of Jannah.”\nIn a July 6 Instagram post, Hamad shared a picture of a firearm with the message, “Alright yall say a prayer with me. Inshallah one day each bullet in this mag kisses the foreheads of the Zionist oppressor.”\nBoth Hamad and Collins conspired to manufacture and possess a destructive device and discussed the potential uses for the devices they were building and testing, the indictment charges, noting that after the pair detonated one device, Hamad built additional devices, including pipe bombs, and detonated those.\nCollins is the daughter of Chad Collins, a pastor at Valley View Presbyterian Church in Garfield and a national organizer with Friends of Sabeel North America, an organization the Anti-Defamation League has characterized as “a driving force behind various Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaigns.”\nChad Collins and some members of his family are vocal anti-Israel activists and participated in last summer’s illegal encampments at the University of Pittsburgh. His daughter, Nesta Collins, was arrested and charged with obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct at the encampment. The criminal complaint alleges that Nesta Collins rushed a security barrier at the encampment with the intent to disassemble it, and pushed it into responding police officers. Chad Collins was a spokesperson for the encampment group at a June news conference.\nIn May 2024, the pastor shared to his Facebook and Instagram accounts a graphic that featured an inverted red triangle, a symbol used by Hamas to mark military targets. At the time of his arrest, Hamad was found to own a shirt featuring the same inverted red triangle and the words “Respect existence or expect resistance,” with a figure whose face is covered by a keffiyeh.\nAn inverted red triangle was part of the graffiti painted on Chabad of Squirrel Hill’s building.\nThe government believes Hamad had been attending Chad Collins’ church on Sundays, according to a recent court filing.\nLess than a month ago, Hamad filed a motion to modify the conditions of his 2024 home detention release while awaiting trial for charges of damaging religious property and conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States.\nIn support of his motion — which the judge ultimately denied — Hamad stated that he “has been on home detention for approximately 152 days, with no violations of any kind reported to this Honorable Court,” and proffered several letters from friends attesting to his character.\nOne of those letters was written by Elyanna Sharbaji, a University of Pittsburgh graduate who served as vice president of the anti-Israel campus group Students for Justice in Palestine. SJP was recently suspended by the university and is currently working with the ACLU to sue the school.\nSharbaji also worked with Not On our Dime, an anti-Israel, BDS organization that collected signatures to get a referendum on the May 2025 ballot that, if passed, would have prohibited the city from doing business with Israel or any entity that does business with Israel. Not On Our Dime ultimately stipulated that it was unable to collect the requisite number of valid signatures.\nShawn Brokos, director of community security for the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, said the indictment is a “testament to the persistent and diligent work of law enforcement” and “indicative of the incredible collaboration with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners.\n“The July 29, 2024, targeted graffiti assault at the Jewish Federation and Chabad of Squirrel Hill was not just a graffiti case — it was the overt act masking a serious and dangerous intent to do harm to the Jewish community. The investigation uncovered a much deeper and complex conspiracy involving Hamad, Collins and Talya Lubit, including allegiance to a foreign terrorist organization, a desire to eradicate Jews and Israel, and a pathway to violence culminating in the acquisition of explosive devices. This investigation serves as a reminder that we need to remain diligent and continue to leave no stone unturned as we protect our community.”\nHamad faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Collin faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Lubit faces up to one year in prison and a $100,000 fine.\nAt April 23 hearings, Collins was released on bond, and Hamad was detained pending an April 29 detention hearing.

The average 12-month total for 2024 averaged more than 25 targeted anti-Jewish incidents in the United States per day — more than one an hour — according to the report.\nGet The Jewish Chronicle Weekly Edition by email and never miss our top stories\nFREE SIGN UP\nFor the first time in the ADL’s reporting history, a majority of the incidents, 5,452, were related to Israel. Nearly 2,600 took place at anti-Israel rallies in the form of antisemitic speeches, chants, signs and slogans. Pittsburgh has been home to several of these rallies, a large portion of which took place around the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, and were organized or promoted by groups like Students for Justice in Palestine, Jewish Voice for Peace, Pittsburgh Apartheid Divest and Steel City Antifascist League.\nStudents for Justice in Palestine and the Party for Socialism and Liberation were the two most active organizers or co-sponsors of protests where antisemitic incidents occurred, the ADL reported. Combined, they were involved in more than 50% of the protests in this category.\nAllegheny County reported 84 incidents, second only to Philadelphia County. Most of those, 78, occurred in Pittsburgh. The city was second in the list of top cities and towns with the most reported incidents, surpassed only by Philadelphia. Both cities are home to large university campuses, where 45% of the state’s incidents occurred.\n“In Pittsburgh, we saw a lot of vandalism this year and, unfortunately, a couple of the assaults that happened in the report happened to University of Pittsburgh students,” said Kelly Fishman, the ADL’s regional director serving Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia and western Pennsylvania.\nOne of the more alarming trends, Fishman said, has been the number of times swastikas were present at rallies or painted as graffiti. The Nazi symbol was found everywhere from public places to elementary schools, she noted.\n“And I’m really concerned about the rise of Holocaust denial, of Holocaust misinformation, of people saying, ‘Oh, Jews are making up the numbers and the experiences of the Holocaust,’” she said.\nFishman said that what has occurred in Pittsburgh over the last year has been alarming.\n“The idea that we can shut down Jewish voices — we’ve seen BDS referendums and a lot of antisemitism on campus,” she said.\nThe ADL continues to be concerned by antisemitic incidents from the far-right and far-left, Fishman said, noting that there is a “horseshoe effect” where the two seemingly polar opposite political ideologies meet.\n“When we think about any kind of extremist ideology, when you become so extreme that you’re willing to use violence, there starts to be a lot less that separates you,” she said.\nFishman is hopeful that antisemitic incidents have reached their apex on college campuses but said there are still a disproportionate number of outside agitators, not associated with the universities and colleges, who are attempting to “keep the fire burning around the issue where a lot of students in places like Pitt, Carnegie Mellon, Case, have kind of let go of that,” she said.\nThose outside agitators, she said, often push content created by Iran, Hamas, and other of its proxies.\nDespite the efforts of those hoping to continue to push anti-Israel, anti-Zionist and antisemitic messages, local universities have “been working really hard to fight against antisemitism on campus,” she said, noting that Carnegie Mellon went from a C to a B, and the University of Pittsburgh rose from a D to a C in the ADL’s antisemitism report card.\nAnd while much of what has been occurring on college campuses is initiated by far-left groups, Fishman said far-right extremists are still active.\n“We’ve seen it shift into more progressive ideology, really targeting the LGBTQ+ community, the immigrant community,” she said. “White supremacists and extremists follow whatever’s happening politically in the country so right now we’re seeing them target those progressive ideologies. To be fair, they still use antisemitic tropes — that didn’t go away but we are seeing them move especially into anti-immigrant ideology.”\nFishman said the battle against hate is fought in person and online. She noted that several platforms — including Roblox and Minecraft — have become home to antisemitic rhetoric.\n“There was a story from a rabbi I worked with in Ohio, who called me because a gentleman in the community called him and said, ‘My child got sucked into this online platform.’ The school called and said there had been some pretty antisemitic ideology that the child was sharing. It was a 10-year-old girl,” Fishman said.\nIf there is a bright spot in the last year, Fishman said, it’s that the Jewish community isn’t standing alone.\n“We do see a lot of allies in Pittsburgh,” she said. “We’re working with the Hindu community. We’re working with the Black community. These are all identity groups that have also felt the pressure.”\nThere were 76 antisemitic incidents logged into the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh’s Virtual Command Center this time last year. So far, there have been 98 reported in 2025. PJC\nDavid Rullo can be reached at drullo@pittsburghjewishchronicle.org."}

The Holocaust-surviving soon-to-be centenarian will eat the first one with friends and family in Sarasota, Florida, where he’s been wintering. The second cake will be enjoyed by Singer with beloved company upon returning to Pittsburgh.\nBoth cakes, Singer, said, will have a vanilla base with strawberry filling. And, at each celebration, there’ll be tuna, salmon, bagels and blintzes. Whether the latter is homemade, however, is debatable.\n“We’re going to look for Golden’s blintzes — they’re hard to find here,” Singer’s daughter Lee Fischbach, 66, told the Chronicle before an interruption.\n“My daughter won’t let me cook here. I’m too messy in the kitchen,” Singer said with a laugh.\nLee Fischbach and Oscar Singer. (Photo courtesy of Lee Fischbach)\nSinger and Fischbach spoke with the Chronicle by phone from Sarasota.\nTen years ago, he and his wife moved in with their daughter. Two-and-a-half years later, Singer’s wife died.\n“It was right after that that I decided, ‘Oh my gosh, time really is wasted,’” Fischbach said.\nGrowing up, Fischbach and her two siblings heard little about their father’s earlier days. He rarely mentioned his imprisonment and forced labor in the Mielec, Wieliczka, Krakau-Plaszow, Theresienstadt and Auschwitz camps, or how he was beaten by Nazis inside the Mielec airplane factory. He barely discussed his relocation to a German tank factory near Dresden, or how he worked in its kitchen and smuggled a potato for his brother but was discovered by Nazis who sicced their dog on him, leaving Singer with leg wounds that still remain.\nHe hardly noted that after the war he was held in Landsberg displaced persons camp, how he and his best friend at the time, Max, returned to Max’s pre-war home in Radogoszcz, near Dąbrowa Tarnowska, Poland, how Max saw someone who used to work for his family on the farm, how Max asked the man if Max’s father had left anything from before the war, how the man reentered the house, exited with a shotgun, killed Max on the spot and told Singer, “We don’t want you Jews. We don’t want you to come home. The Germans gave us your property.”\nSinger, who married an American-born woman and helped raise three children in Denver, Colorado, rarely referred to his birth in the Galician village of Radomyśl Wielki, how his father was the area’s kosher butcher, how every Shabbat the rabbi and townspeople would come to their four-room cottage with stone floors for meat, or, how even after the war Singer never went home.\nTo those he knew in Colorado, Singer was a food service professional.\nBetween 1951 and 1970 he operated Buddy’s Italian Restaurant: one in Denver, one in Littletown. Then, between 1970 and 2016, he ran Singer’s Gourmet Catering. Singer worked until he was 90, when a fall forced his retirement. He rehabbed the injury and avoided addressing the past.\nAfter the Holocaust, he had the inked number on his arm removed. Not so for the “KL” tattoo, which German Nazis also seared into his skin to prevent escape from the Konzentrationslager (concentration camps). The injection was too deep.\nAs an adult, Singer’s stories were few. But some tales emerged.\n“He was always having bad dreams at night, and he would have night terrors,” Fischbach said.\nYears ago, little was known about PTSD, and “my mother just felt that speaking [about the war] would be the worst thing for him.”\nSinger wasn’t exactly free to stop and spout. As a grown man, he often worked two, even three, jobs at once. It’s difficult imagining when he would have had the time to talk about earlier horrors, Fischbach continued. But also, “I think emotionally, my mother felt that he was too fragile to deal with it.”\nA lifetime of episodes were dammed, but Singer’s story surfaced in spurts.\n“When I was a little girl, I had a lot of freckles. I hated my freckles, and he would say, ‘Oh no, no, no, you look just like my sister. She had lots of freckles, too.’ And that was all that he would say before he would start to cry,” Fischbach said. “We did not know a lot about my dad and his experiences. We just knew every once in a while he would share a bit of information, and then he would go back into his shell, and we wouldn’t be able to ask anything or know anything until the next time that it just came up.”\nFinally, after her mother died, Fischbach altered the narrative. She pressed her father to speak. And he did. At Chatham University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania and in classrooms across south Florida and western Pennsylvania, Singer shared his life story.\nAfter moving to the United States, Oscar Singer worked as a food professional. (Photo courtesy of Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh)\nHe talked about his parents and four siblings, who were all killed in the war. He recalled post-war Munich, and being hired to wash dishes in Hofbrauhaus. He described learning to cook non-kosher sausage and spaghetti in Modena, Italy. And, to every willing listener, Singer happily related his love of food.\n“I like food. I enjoy it and I don’t look too bad. I’m not too heavy,” he told the Chronicle. “I never ate food when I was in the concentration camp. You couldn’t get it. Only on Christmas they would give us ham, but it was just the bones and the fat.”\nSinger, who frequently mentions God and growing up in an observant home, acknowledged that ham is definitionally treif “but you had to eat it if you wanted to live.”\nAnd no matter what, life must be extolled, he continued. “People have so much hate. They’re killing each other and that doesn’t make sense. We’re going to run out of cemeteries pretty soon.”\nAs the Holocaust survivor reaches 100, life, death and the divine are frequent topics.\n“I always pray to God. I go to daven every Saturday morning,” he said.\nThe comment spurred a memory.\nSinger said he can still see his father standing in the basement of their home in September 1939. It was morning, the German Nazis were nearing and Singer’s father had donned a prayer shawl and phylacteries: “I said they’re going to see you in the tallis and tefillin. They’ll kill you.”\nHis father told him not to worry, that God will help and the messiah will come.\n“Moshiach is coming,” Singer said with a chuckle. “I’ve been waiting for 100 years.”\nThe retired restaurateur and caterer is set to celebrate his birthday on May 10. At both of his parties there will be vanilla cake with strawberry filling. There’ll be tuna, salmon, bagels and blintzes. Along with plates of food, Singer will be surrounded by family and friends. He might even share that May 10 isn’t the day he was born.\nThose records were destroyed in the war, he said. “I chose May 10 because that was the day the Russians came in. They came in that day and they opened the door for us in Theresienstadt.” PJC\nAdam Reinherz can be reached at areinherz@pittsburghjewishchronicle.org."}

She previously served as the community outreach manager for then-Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and was a member of the PA Medical Marijuana Advisory Board. The University of Pittsburgh and Oxford alum has served on numerous boards and is deeply committed to the region.\nPatel is a strong supporter of not only the Hindu community — of which she is a member — and immigrant communities, but also the Jewish community.\nGet The Jewish Chronicle Weekly Edition by email and never miss our top stories\nFREE SIGN UP\nThe Glass Fellowship, she said, helped strengthen her resolve and help cement her belief in people telling their “own truths.”\n“If you don’t tell your own truth, there’s always going to be somebody out there that’s willing to misrepresent it for their own political gain or hateful gain,” Patel said.\nAn entire generation, she explained, is being fed negative information through social media and online content about their identities, faith and culture and are internalizing it as truth.\nThe Jewish community, Patel noted, has learned to push back and tell their stories in the fight against hate and antisemitism. It’s something she hopes the Hindu community learns, as well.\nPatel saw firsthand the ADL’s fight against hate while participating in the Glass Leadership Institute.\nGLI was established more than 20 years ago to provide young professionals with an insider’s perspective of the ADL’s programs and a deep understanding of the cutting-edge strategies employed to confront antisemitism and hate, according to the ADL’s website.\nThe fellowship consisted of biweekly Zoom sessions centered on a particular topic with presentations from the ADL.\n“We dove deep into different case studies and got a sense of how they navigate the challenges of how information flows,” Patel said. “Each session was devised in the way that we were essentially hearing from the experts. It was really dense, but they did a wonderful job of bringing together people that really care about the issues and a sense of community.”\nThe lessons went beyond just learning about antisemitism and hate, Patel said, and allowed for exploration of data and research.\n“It was a really unique experience,” she said, “that reinforced, for me, not just the urgency of confronting antisemitism but also the sort of systems that allow it to persist. It’s not something that just happens. It gradually grows and manifests through rhetoric.”\nAs part of the fellowship, Patel attended the ADL’s Never is Now conference, from March 3-4 in New York City.\nThe conference featured more than 100 experts leading various panels and discussions and presented an opportunity to build in-person relationships with other GLI fellows as well as ADL staff.\nPatel called the experience “eye opening,” and said it provided an opportunity to meet with other people across the country who are passionate about fighting antisemitism and educating themselves about some current challenges.\nThe conference, she said, provided an opportunity to think about “media bias, as well as coalition and community building.”\nKaren Gal-Or, who nominated Patel for the fellowship, said she has been an unwavering ally to the Jewish community.\n“In the painful months following Oct. 7, she stood beside us in solidarity and compassion,” Gal-Or said. “Bhavini has played an instrumental role in building bridges between the Jewish and Hindu communities in Pittsburgh, always leading with empathy, integrity and a deep commitment to democracy.”\nPatel said the lessons learned through the fellowship will help to combat not only antisemitism and anti-Hindu vitriol but hate more broadly, and will help foster understanding of the challenges and fears communities face “when they’re forced to stand on a stage and say, ‘This is hate,’ when the entire world is telling you it’s not.”\nThose lessons, Patel said, reverberate throughout society.\n“I think it reinforces how to build a healthy democracy,” she said. “I think we’re facing such a crisis right now where we don’t realize democracy is such a fragile thing. We’re treating complex geopolitical issues as zero-sum games at the cost of forgetting our humanity and being able to connect with one another.”\nThe fellowship, she said, provides an opportunity to “take these lessons back to our communities and say, ‘Here’s what we’re going to do as neighbors and community members to tell the truth and fight against hate and build positivity.’” PJC\nDavid Rullo can be reached at drullo@pittsburghjewishchronicle.org."}

The Pittsburgh Jewish Library, created in memory of Rabbi Yosef Grossman, opened last month. Designed by Grossman’s sister-in-law Squirrel Hill resident Chedva Jaffa, the library, which is located at 5831 Bartlett Street in the basement of Young Israel of Pittsburgh, features more than 400 titles from popular publishing houses including ArtScroll, Feldheim and Israel Bookshop Publications.\nThe works, which include fiction, nonfiction, history and short stories, provide access to insights largely unavailable in the city, Jaffa explained.\nPittsburgh has a wonderful public library system, she said, but many of the books within its collections aren’t necessarily “geared to our community.” Additionally, in lieu of having to “filter” books at the public library, parents of younger readers, or teens themselves, can choose works at the Pittsburgh Jewish Library that parents already “approve of.”\nGet The Jewish Chronicle Weekly Edition by email and never miss our top stories\nFREE SIGN UP\nCurating content suitable for patrons is a familiar practice at libraries nationwide.\nAccording to the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, which is frequented by more than 2.9 million people annually, its collections “support the educational, leisure and general information needs of the community.”\nThe Brooklyn Public Library, which serves 620,000 active cardholders, acquires titles while striving to “meet the current requirements of the community and to anticipate future needs.”\nTiered membership allows access to Pittsburgh Jewish Library’s collection of titles.

Despite his concern, he was an avid proponent of literacy. “He was always buying books for his kids that reflected community values, that were about living a frum (observant) lifestyle. He was very into that.”\nGrossman, Jaffa continued, was also a firm believer in lending books to others and ensuring finances did not preclude Pittsburghers from obtaining meaningful titles.\nThe Pittsburgh Jewish Library, which officially opened March 21, relies on donations and tiered affiliations.\nAn individual membership is $20 per year, while a family membership costs $50.\nThe facility is open Fridays 2:30-3:30 p.m. Members may only check out four books at a time, but much is subject to change, Jaffa said. “We hope to expand and serve even more of the community.” PJC\nAdam Reinherz can be reached at areinherz@pittsburghjewishchronicle.org."}

How Pittsburgh’s Jewish community can help", "date": "May 6, 2025, 4:16 pm", "link": "https://jewishchronicle.timesofisrael.com/worried-about-dementia-how-pittsburghs-jewish-community-can-help/", "type": "article", "content": "Have you noticed changes in the memory or thinking skills of someone important to you? Many people occasionally forget things as they age, especially when they are stressed or sick. However, if someone is consistently or increasingly having trouble remembering, experiencing confusion, or finding it hard to do everyday tasks, it may be a sign that they are developing dementia.\nDementia is not a specific disease. It is an umbrella term describing a wide range of symptoms that are associated with a decline in memory and other thinking skills and severe enough to interfere with daily life. There are more than 100 different types of dementia, which is caused by diseases that gradually destroy brain cells.\nAlzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 60% to 80% of cases. Other types include dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, and vascular dementia. Each type affects the brain differently and can lead to distinct patterns of symptoms, which is why no two individuals experience dementia in the same way.\nGet The Jewish Chronicle Weekly Edition by email and never miss our top stories\nFREE SIGN UP\nAs people age, it is common to experience slowing in thought processes and occasional forgetfulness. Misplacing keys, forgetting a name, or needing more time to learn a new skill are examples of age-related changes.\nIn contrast, dementia involves more persistent and disruptive changes that affect daily functioning. Someone living with dementia may forget the names of close family members, have trouble following directions, or become disoriented in familiar environments.\nCommon signs of dementia\nAlthough the symptoms of dementia vary based on the individual and the type, there are early warning signs:\n• Memory loss: Forgetting recently learned information or asking the same question repeatedly\n• Difficulty concentrating: Having a hard time paying attention or problem-solving, such as following a recipe\n• Challenges with daily tasks: Difficulty with familiar routines, like handling money, using a phone, or managing medications\n• Communication challenges: Having trouble finding the right word or following a conversation\n• Disorientation: Getting confused about the time, date, or location\n• Mood or behavior changes: Increased anxiety, depression, irritability, or withdrawal from social activities\nRecognizing these early warning signs can lead to a timely medical evaluation and diagnosis. If you suspect dementia, it is essential to consult with a health care professional. Early diagnosis allows for better planning and access to support services that can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.\n\nResources in the Jewish community\nFor individuals living with dementia and those important to them, community resources can make a difference. There are several programs and services available in the Pittsburgh Jewish community to assist people at various stages of memory loss.\n• Dementia Friendly Pennsylvania (dementiafriendlypa.org): This program of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation aims to reduce stigma and promote inclusion through two initiatives:\no Dementia Friends Pennsylvania: Offers free, 60-minute informational sessions to change how people think, act and talk about dementia. Sessions are open to community members of all ages and help raise awareness while promoting empathy and understanding.\no Dementia Friendly Pennsylvania Communities: Supports communities across Pennsylvania that actively work to be informed, safe, respectful and inclusive of people living with dementia and those important to them.\n• Memory Café at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh (bit.ly/jccmemorycafe): A memory café is a welcoming social gathering for people living with dementia and their care partners, family and friends. It provides a safe, relaxed and supportive space to enjoy conversation, music and activities. The monthly memory café at the Squirrel Hill JCC, with JHF support, fosters connection and community in a judgment-free setting, and is expanding to the South Hills JCC this summer.\n• Jewish Association on Aging (jaapgh.org/memory-care): The JAA provides comprehensive memory care services including:\no Anathan Adult Day Memory Care: Individuals who live at home can spend the day on the JAA campus participating in engaging activities designed for people living with dementia. This program supports participants and their care partners, especially those who work or need time for themselves.\no Ahava Memory Care Residence: A specialized assisted living community offering person-centered care in a secure, home-like environment designed to meet the unique needs of those living with dementia.\nIf you are concerned about a loved one’s memory or behavior, you are not alone — and you don’t have to navigate this journey by yourself. From understanding the signs of dementia to accessing meaningful support, your awareness can make a difference.

Even in stable times, many people find comfort in the presence of a trusted listener who offers companionship and the opportunity for reflection.\nWhile many older adults thrive in the later stages of life, others find it more difficult. Chaplains can be a valuable source of support for seniors facing the challenges of aging and life transitions. For those who feel unfulfilled in retirement and are missing the sense of purpose and structure their careers provided, for example, spiritual guidance and wisdom can help them rediscover meaning. Further, the stress of managing health issues and the realities of aging can also feel overwhelming.\nSupport and compassionate insight can provide comfort and help seniors navigate these challenges.\nGet The Jewish Chronicle Weekly Edition by email and never miss our top stories\nFREE SIGN UP\nSeniors who are homebound, in particular, may feel isolated and disconnected from the world. A visiting chaplain can provide a valuable connection to others, especially for those without access to their own spiritual leaders.\nAs we age, many experience great personal loss, such as the death of friends or a spouse, which can cause intense grief and loneliness. During these times of mourning and heartache, the presence of a kindhearted counselor can be a vital source of support, helping individuals cope with grief, process their emotions and begin to heal.\nChaplaincy is about creating a safe, non-judgmental space where people can navigate personal challenges and obstacles. Although their backgrounds are rooted in spiritual traditions, this form of care extends beyond religious boundaries. Supporting people from all different backgrounds is special and important. Some may request religious rituals, observances and discussions about their faith while others may find spirituality in reflection and conversation. They will help the individual in whatever way is most comfortable and meaningful to that person.\nChaplains have a very important role serving those at the end of life by providing compassionate, person-centered care that addresses individuals’ spiritual, emotional and other important needs. These visits often include deep conversations, reflections or music, or simply the warmth of companionship, listening and providing a comforting presence.\nFamily members whose loved ones are at the end of life also benefit from this compassionate support. Chaplains offer a calm, caring presence during this often unfamiliar and overwhelming time. Just as they do for the patient, they create a safe space for family members to have open conversations and share their fears, hopes and emotions. They help loved ones through grief, which can begin even before death, and continue to be there for them after their loved one has passed and they move through the journey of bereavement.\nFrom the perspective of a chaplain, one of the most beautiful qualities of life is the way people relate and connect to each other. They approach each visit with empathy, respect and a sincere desire to help. Even if they have not personally experienced the challenges faced by the person they are visiting, their authenticity and genuine care about the other person and their situation will allow them to deeply connect. Sometimes, simply being present is all a person needs.\nRespect is an integral part of chaplaincy and is the foundation of meaningful spiritual care. While we all have a unique personal journey, it is important to respect and acknowledge each other’s differences. These differences do not need to divide us, rather they can complement each other. Our strength is not only in our individual identity, but in how we relate to one another and work together. Diversity and respect for our differences is a virtue. Chaplaincy, like caregiving, is a way of reaching those that we are providing care for, but also helps us have a better understanding of ourselves. Through being good to others, we reach our true sense of self and fulfill our true nature and purpose.\nAs we enter the month when we will celebrate Lag B’Omer, we are reminded of the lesson from the story of Rabbi Akiva’s students that showing respect for one another is important. Through the teachings of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, we understand that — Sheves Achim Gam Yachad — we are stronger and better when we are united together. May we embrace this as a community and may we be an example of respect, understanding and unity. PJC\nRabbi Dovid Small is director of pastoral care at the Jewish Association on Aging."}

The Diaspora Ministry report, in contrast, devoted much of its focus to assigning blame to different entities for allowing hate speech and activity to persist and went further than others in linking anti-Israel sentiment to antisemitism.\n“This shocking data highlights the ongoing failure of international institutions and many Western countries,” Diaspora Minister Amichai Chikli said in a press release. “The Israeli government will not hesitate to point out those who encourage antisemitism — be it governments, universities, or social networks.”\nThe report synthesized data from various sources, including watchdog organizations like the Anti-Defamation League and UN Watch, global research institutions and Jewish umbrella organizations in different countries, the ministry said.\nGet The Jewish Chronicle Weekly Edition by email and never miss our top stories\nFREE SIGN UP\nThe publication comes just over a month after the ministry was lambasted for embracing far-right European politicians and disparaging left-wing organizations at an international conference on combating antisemitism it organized in Jerusalem.\nWhile the ministry devoted a handful of pages to the Arab and Muslim world, where accusations of endemic antisemitism persist, the lion’s share of the report focuses on the West; Iran, where some 8,000 Jews live under the regime’s Islamist repression, is mentioned only in the context of Tehran’s support for anti-Israel activities and terror.\nIn Canada, the report found a “significant increase in antisemitic incidents in intensity and forms not previously seen” in the country following Oct. 7, 2023, counting a 670% jump in anti-Jewish incidents over the previous year.\n“In 2024, Canada earned the dubious distinction as ‘champion of antisemitism,” a ministry press release accompanying the report read.\nFormer Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau’s condemnation of Israel at the United Nations in December 2023, just two months after the Oct. 7 massacre, helped fuel that country’s rampant Jew-hatred, the report alleged.\nTrudeau stepped down from his position in January 2025, and was replaced by Liberal Mark Carney in national elections last week.\nCanada has made efforts to quell rising antisemitism within its borders, although Jewish groups say much more is needed.\nIn Australia, where a string of arson attacks and other vandalism at synagogues and elsewhere has shaken the Jewish community, the report recorded a 320% jump in antisemitic incidents compared to the months before the Oct. 7 Hamas attack.\nIn the United States, antisemitic incidents rose by 200%, the report said.\nThe report also quoted from surveys showing many European Jews fearing for their future in the Continent. A CRIF poll cited in the study found 64% of French citizens believe Jews have valid reasons to fear living there. In Germany, the ADL found that 80% of Jews reported feeling less safe, while in Britain, 90% of Jewish respondents told the Campaign Against Antisemitism that they avoid city centers during anti-Israel demonstrations.\nThe report largely tied countries’ responses to antisemitism to the level of official criticism aimed at the Jewish state.\nSouth Africa, Ireland and Spain were all highlighted for unfriendly stances toward Israel, which the ministry alleged heightened uneasiness among Jews there.\n“Their asymmetrical application of normative principles directly undermines Jewish communities’ senses of belonging and security within these societies, as documented through both quantitative and qualitative research,” the report said.\nFrance, Britain, Canada and Australia were described as “morally ambiguous” for taking steps to fight antisemitism while simultaneously criticizing Israel to a “disproportionate” extent, endangering local Jewish communities.\nThe report accused French President Emmanuel Macron of helping legitimize antisemitic rhetoric from France’s far-left by making harmful statements about Israel’s military actions in Gaza.\nIn the U.K., the Labour government was criticized for its arms embargo against Israel, and the state-owned broadcaster BBC was called out for refusing to call Hamas members “terrorists” and for covering up antisemitic complaints.\nOnly the United States and Germany were recognized as fully supporting the fight against antisemitism in the report.\nInternational organizations were criticized for maintaining a double standard on Israel compared to the rest of the world. In 2024, the United Nations General Assembly passed 17 resolutions condemning Israel, and only six against all other countries combined, the report said.\nThe International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, which the report urged governments worldwide to adopt, says criticism of Israel that places a double standard on the country is a form of anti-Jewish hate.\nThe report also backed the government’s contention that cases against Israel in the Hague are antisemitic. Arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes in Gaza were listed in the report as “among the most severe antisemitic incidents of 2024.”\nICC prosecutor Karim Khan has vociferously denied antisemitic motivations.\nOn social media, TikTok was singled out as a major source of antisemitic content, with the report quoting a former senior official at TikTok Israel who called the platform an “existential danger to Israel.”\nMany of the people responsible for TikTok’s advertising policies support Hamas, the Houthis and other terrorist organizations, while Israel’s sponsored campaigns on the short-form video platform have all been blocked, the report alleges.\nTikTok has said it works to block hate speech on its platform. The social network has initiated several projects to promote Holocaust remembrance on its site, among other causes.\nThe report noted that all major social media networks, including TikTok, made efforts to curb antisemitic messaging after the Oct. 7 attack.\nHowever, these efforts have been insufficiently enforced. During the most recent U.S. elections, Instagram removed 40% of antisemitic content from its platform, Facebook removed 24%, X removed 22%, and TikTok removed just 17%, the report claims.\nAccording to the report, 2,087 antisemitic incidents were recorded on college campuses between June 2023 and May 2024, 477% more than a year earlier.\nColumbia University in New York was labeled the most antisemitic campus in the U.S., with 127 antisemitic incidents in 2024, of which 90% were linked with far-left movements. UCLA earned a distant second with 63 incidents, followed by the University of Michigan (35) and Harvard University (32), according to data from the Amcha Initiative cited in the report. PJC"}

Hours later, President Donald Trump announced in the Oval Office that the United States and the Houthis had reached a truce.\nThat truce, mediated by Oman, did not include Israel, which reportedly hadn’t even been given advance warning of the deal.\nGet The Jewish Chronicle Weekly Edition by email and never miss our top stories\nFREE SIGN UP\n“We had some very good news last night: The Houthis have announced that… they don’t want to fight anymore, they just don’t want to fight, and we will honor that,” Trump said in an Oval Office meeting alongside the Canadian prime minister. “And we will stop the bombings, and they have capitulated, but more importantly we will take their word: They say they will not be blowing up ships anymore.”\nThe agreement comes at a tense time for Israel, which is reeling from the disruption wrought by Sunday’s strike and from months of intermittent attacks from the Houthis. Several airlines have canceled flights to the country.\nOn Tuesday, Israel retaliated with a strike that, its military said, “disabled” the airport in Sanaa, which is controlled by the Houthis.\n“I have a simple principle: Eyes for an eye, and teeth for a tooth,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video on Tuesday. “Whoever attacks us, we attack them sevenfold.”\nThe Houthis have been shooting bombs and drones at Israel since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, invasion, which launched the war in Gaza. The Houthis have also bombed U.S. and other ships in the Red Sea, disrupting global shipping lanes.\nThe Houthis, like Hamas, are funded by Iran, and Israel has bombed Houthi targets in Yemen in response. Israeli defenses have intercepted most of the group’s attacks, though some, like Sunday’s have evaded Israel’s protections.\nThat fight looks likely to continue — and will now proceed without U.S. involvement. Trump did not reference Israel in his remarks, but both the Houthis and the U.S. State Department made clear that the agreement does not commit the terror group to stop its attacks on Israel.\nIn response to a question about whether the agreement mandates an end to Houthi-Israel fighting, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said, “This is about the Red Sea, the attacking of ships, and the nature of the action that the United States had taken.”\nFollowing the announcement of the truce, a Houthi official said Israelis should “remain in shelters because their government will not be able to protect them,” which signals that the attacks will continue.\nIsraeli officials did not appear to immediately comment on the truce, which comes at a time of other tensions between the White House and Israel, principally over U.S. negotiations with Iran about its nuclear program. Ron Dermer, an Israeli cabinet minister and Netanyahu confidant, was due to meet with Trump administration officials Wednesday, ahead of Trump’s trip to the Middle East. Trump is not currently scheduled to stop in Israel.\nBefore Trump’s announcement, Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican, had told Jewish Insider about the Houthis that the “president needs to turn them into fish food.” That’s unlikely to happen now. But South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a supporter of Israel and close Trump ally, urged Israel to continue its own attacks.\nHe also suggested that Israel attack Iran — an idea that Trump has reportedly rebuffed.\n“To my friends in Israel, do what you have to do to protect your airspace and your people,” Graham tweeted. “It is long past time to consider hitting Iran hard. It wouldn’t take much to put Iran out of the oil business.” PJC"}

He made the remarks Tuesday at a swearing-in ceremony for his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who in January brokered the ceasefire during which Hamas released dozens of Israeli hostages.\nTrump’s statement also aligns with comments by Sara Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister’s wife, who said in an exchange caught on video last week that “fewer” than 24 hostages were alive.\nGet The Jewish Chronicle Weekly Edition by email and never miss our top stories\nFREE SIGN UP\nHer husband corrected her at the time, and on Tuesday, Israeli officials reiterated that the official number of living hostages remains 24.

New signs of life for many of them came from hostages released at the time.\nTrump appeared to say that three of them had died in the past week. Here is what Trump said at the ceremony:\nThey said, well, only 24 are living, but now it’s 21. That was a week ago. Now it’s 21 are living. And these are young people. Young people don’t die. Old people die. Young people don’t die under these conditions. So, of the 59 people — and they said 59, and I said really — but they said only 24 are living, and I now correct, I say 21. Because as of today, it’s 21, three have died. So this is a terrible situation. We’re trying to get the hostages out. We’ve gotten a lot of them out. As the expression goes, there’s 21 plus a lot of dead bodies.\nIsrael recently adopted a plan to conquer and occupy Gaza, which the military chief of staff said would put the hostages’ lives at risk.

The plan provides for the “conquering of Gaza” and retaining the territory, an Israeli official said Monday morning.\nThe security cabinet unanimously approved the plan to expand the Gaza operation, the official said. It is expected to only be implemented after US President Donald Trump’s visit to the region next week, and until then, efforts will continue to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas, Hebrew media reported.\nThe plan, which the official speaking Monday said had been presented by IDF Chief of Staff Lt.

(Bashar Taleb/AFP)\nThe study is based on data collated by the Gaza Ministry of Health through a centralized and computerized database at Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.\nIn March 2025, the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health published a list of 50,021 fatalities during the war. The list does not differentiate between combatants and civilians, or those who were killed by Hamas’s own combat actions.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile refusing to disclose how many fatalities were combatants, the Hamas Government Media Office has consistently claimed that some 70 percent of those killed during the war were women and children, using the category as a proxy for non-combatants, in order to allege that the IDF indiscriminately kills Palestinian civilians.\nBut Stone and Rose’s analysis of the Ministry of Health list found that in reality the proportion of female and child fatalities in the war was just under 51%.\nBy going through the list of 50,021 fatalities listed, they found 9,790 were adult women 18 years old and over, while 15,613 were children (boys and girls) under the age of 18, giving a total of 25,403 in the women and children category. This represented 50.8% of all fatalities during the war.\nThe study also used data obtained by a research group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which published the dates of death of all 28,185 identified fatalities in the war up until 30 June 2024, to evaluate the rate of deaths of women and children in specific operations such as in Khan Younis, and to show the declining level of fatalities as the war progressed.\nUsing this data, Stone and Rose provided a detailed breakdown of fatalities by age and sex during the IDF’s operation in Khan Younis from January to May 2024.\nThe study identified 2,154 fatalities in the Khan Younis operation, of which 1,411 were adult men, over the age of 18, or 65.5%.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe percentage of women and children killed during that operation was 34.5%.\nPalestinian medics treat a child injured during an Israeli air strike in Rafah, on the southern Gaza Strip, October 13 2023. (Abed Rahim Khatib/Flash90)\nAdditionally, the age brackets for boys and men aged of 15 to 20, 20 to 25, 25 to 30 and 35 to 40 — the most likely age ranges for combatants — were all significantly over represented in the total number of fatalities during the Khan Younis operation.\nOf the child fatalities, 188 were female, or some 9%, compared to 278 male child fatalities, or 13%.\nStone and Rose stated that the higher rate of male child fatalities suggested that a “substantial portion” of boys under the age of 18 were engaged in combat roles during the war.\nThe study also looked at the rate of fatalities during the course of the war, finding that whereas the percentage of women and children killed in October 2023 was 62%, it dropped to 45% in January 2024, and fluctuated around that level thereafter.\n“This is a strong signal that IDF ground troops were attempting to target combatants despite the difficulties of conditions of urban warfare,” Stone and Rose contended.\nThe authors also pointed out that Hamas does not identify fatalities caused by Gaza-based terror groups’ failed attacks, such as the infamous Al-Ahli Hospital incident in October 2023.\nIn addition, a certain number of the 9,000 natural deaths which would be expected to have occurred in Gaza since October 2023 have also been included in the general fatality count for the war.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnd they noted that many Hamas combatants who have been recorded elsewhere as having been killed were not included in the list of the 50,000 Gazans the Ministry of Health said died during the war.\nThe suppression of Hamas’s combatant fatalities has served to further “inflate” the percentage of women and children killed as a total of the overall number of fatalities, and increase the distorted picture of civilian casualties, Stone and Rose pointed out.\n“We do not doubt that a large number of civilians have tragically lost their lives in this conflict, and it is deeply concerning to us,” the two researchers stated.\nThey asserted however that Hamas’s declarations that Israel was committing “genocide” in Gaza “was inconsistent with its own datasets,” and that “doctoring” of the data was possible because many of the medical directors in the Gazan Ministry of Health and hospital system were controlled by Hamas.\n“Sadly, when Hamas’s narratives were accepted and amplified without any forensic critique, to be broadcast enthusiastically by agenda-driven activists, much of the world public was deceived.”"}

It did not examine the wider picture of the military’s perception of Gaza and Hamas in recent years, which has been covered in separate, larger investigations into the IDF’s intelligence and defenses.\nThe probe stated that Golani soldiers who did not protect civilians acted wrongly both “professionally and ethically.” The troops should have rushed toward the terrorists upon seeing them, instead of trying to reposition themselves, the investigation said, describing their actions as a “massive failure.”\n“The soldiers did not risk their lives and did not strive to engage in close combat with the enemy,” the probe said.\nTroops of the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion stand by a Hamas monument at the Palestine Square in Gaza City’s Shejaiya neighborhood, December 18, 2023.

According to a Navy investigation, each boat was traveling at around 30 knots (55 kph), about 500 meters from the coast, with a distance of 600-700 meters between each one.\nThe boats were heading for two IDF bases near the border, as well as to Zikim Beach — with the aim of reaching the nearby kibbutz — and to the Trans-Israel oil pipeline terminal near Ashkelon.\nAt 6:36 a.m., the first of the seven speedboats crossed Israel’s maritime border with Gaza. Within three minutes, it was destroyed by a Dvora-class patrol boat of the Navy’s 916th Patrol Squadron armed with a 25mm Typhoon cannon. Four terrorists aboard were killed.\nA Hamas speedboat is destroyed by an Israeli Navy Dvora-class patrol boat on October 7, 2023. (Israel Defense Forces)\nThe second speedboat, after seeing the first being destroyed, made a U-turn and instead of continuing to the oil terminal, reached the coast near the border, close to a shooting range that belongs to Zikim Training Base. Three terrorists disembarked at 6:40 a.m. and joined up with several others who had infiltrated through the border barrier, attacking Zikim Base.\nThe third speedboat managed to arrive near the oil terminal before being destroyed at 6:43 a.m. by the same Navy patrol boat. Sailors of the Snapir harbor security unit on a small Defender-class boat opened fire and used depth charges against the surviving terrorists. All seven terrorists aboard the boat were killed.\nThe fourth speedboat arrived at Zikim Beach at 6:45 a.m., and five terrorists got off.\nIsraeli Navy sailors of the Snapir unit eliminate Hamas terrorists in the sea after their speedboat was destroyed by a Dvora-class patrol boat on October 7, 2023.

Three of the terrorists were killed, while three others survived and managed to reach the Israeli coast, heading toward the pipeline facility. (Later in the morning, at around 9:30 a.m., two of the terrorists were killed by Navy shelling.)\nThe sixth speedboat, with seven terrorists aboard it, also landed on Zikim Beach at 6:48 a.m. Another Dvora-class patrol boat, which had been defending an offshore gas rig, shelled the terrorists on the beach, killing two of them.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe seventh and last speedboat, with six terrorists on board, docked near an IDF logistics base close to Zikim Training Base at 6:52 a.m. One of the patrol boats opened fire on it, killing four of the Hamas attackers. The surviving two terrorists breached the logistics base and were killed by Golani soldiers stationed there.\nMassacre on the beach\nAs Hamas’s rocket fire began at 6:29 a.m., a squad of six Golani soldiers in a GMC Savana van positioned outside Zikim Base headed into the IDF logistics base. At 6:42 a.m., the troops, joined by another soldier, Sgt. Dvir Lisha, 21, headed for the beach after receiving reports of a seaborne infiltration.\nAt 6:43 a.m., 32 civilians were sheltering at the beach, including eight in the bathroom, 12 in the bomb shelter, two under the beach’s sunshades, five in the sand dunes to the north of the beach, four in the sand dunes to the south, and one in the parking lot.\nThe seven Golani soldiers reached the bathroom at 6:44 a.m., where they met the civilians and told them to stay put. The troops then advanced toward the sea, as the fourth Hamas speedboat, with five terrorists on board, arrived a minute later.\nHamas terrorists aboard a speedboat dock at Zikim Beach and launch a massacre on October 7, 2023.

According to surveillance footage, the troops withdrew to the bathroom area at 6:46 a.m. There was a distance of about 110 meters between the soldiers and the terrorists, and limited visibility. Lisha attempted to return fire while using the bathroom building as cover, but was unable to hit any of the terrorists.\nMeanwhile, the terrorists advanced on the sunshades area, murdering two fishermen, John Aslanov, 70, and Robert Shaulov, 70.\nThe soldiers, at this point, had lost eye contact with the terrorists and decided at 6:47 a.m. to withdraw further back toward the parking lot, while leaving behind the eight civilians in the bathroom and 12 others in the bomb shelter. The troops reached an elevated position on the edge of the parking lot, thinking they could see the terrorists from there, but structures were blocking their view.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe terrorists pushed forward toward the parking lot and opened fire on the soldiers after spotting them.

However, the troops did not stop where the civilians were, but rather moved even further away, for unclear reasons.\nThe five surviving terrorists of the sixth speedboat joined up with the five terrorists already at the beach and opened fire on the soldiers hiding in the dunes, wounding one of them. Another was shell-shocked. The Navy shelling against the terrorists also hit close to where the civilians and soldiers were hiding, though none were wounded by it, the probe found.\nFootage released by Hamas shows terrorists attacking Zikim Beach area on October 7, 2023.

In the bomb shelter, the terrorists murdered another seven civilians: Eli and Arye Uzan, 68 and 42, Benny Genish, 70, Avi Hasday, 53, Yulia Chaban, 24, Danil Kimenfeld, 64, and Vladimir Zhukov, 63.\nLisha, at 6:51 a.m., told the soldier next to him at the elevated position that he was going to join the commander of the squad. But instead of heading for the dunes, the soldier, for unclear reasons, ran straight toward the bathroom, where the terrorists were located. He was immediately killed, and the terrorists took his gun.\nSgt. Dvir Lisha who was killed by Hamas on October 7, 2023. (IDF)\nAt 6:54 a.m., six of the terrorists at the beach advanced on foot along the Nahal Shikma stream, toward Kibbutz Zikim. The other four, at 6:57 a.m., took control of the Golani soldiers’ van and headed out of the parking lot, also toward Zikim.\nDefense of Kibbutz Zikim\nAt 6:40 a.m., the Ashdod Naval Base notified the chief of Kibbutz Zikim’s civil defense squad that a seaborne infiltration was underway. The security chief alerted the team, who were all armed with assault rifles. The team began to take up their posts at 6:42 a.m.\nOne member of the security team stationed at a post on the edge of the kibbutz identified the stolen IDF van approaching on the road at 7:04 a.m., though he initially thought it was Israeli forces.

Meanwhile, the chief of the local security team and two other officers reached the post and exchanged fire with the terrorists.\nIsraeli soldiers patrol the Zikim Beach near the border with northern Gaza on February 12, 2025.

At this point, two of the terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire.\nAt around 8 a.m., the terrorists hurled eight grenades at the post, wounding two members of the security team. Others took up the post and continued the exchange of fire with the terrorists.\nAt 8:20 a.m., Shin Bet officer Michael Ben Moshe, 26, arrived on the road outside Zikim while trying to reach a nearby IDF base. He got out of his car and exchanged fire with the terrorists before being killed. Some of the terrorists took his car, and drove it back to the Zikim Base area.\nMichael Ben Moshe (Courtesy)\nAt the same time, civilians fleeing from a party at an undesignated beach, who had initially hid at Zikim Base, passed by the area and came under fire by the terrorists. Three were lightly wounded.\nAt 8:45 a.m., troops of the Maglan commando unit reached Zikim after being alerted by their company commander, a resident of the kibbutz. The commandos picked up their officer and drove to the location of the exchange of fire, then advanced on the terrorists, killing two.\nAt this point, the remaining terrorists withdrew and abandoned their plan to capture Kibbutz Zikim.\nAftermath\nAt 12:30 p.m., troops of the 202nd Paratroopers Brigade scanned the beach for possible terrorists, but found none. The soldiers found some of the bodies and removed them, but were dispatched to Kfar Aza before they could continue.\nAt 11 p.m., other paratroopers were dispatched to protect Zikim, as the military believed there were still terrorists in the area.\nOn October 8, two terrorists were killed by Navy shelling and ground troops near Zikim Beach.\nHamas terrorists are killed by Israeli Navy shelling near Zikim Beach on October 8, 2023.

The bodies of the other slain civilians were removed during scans on October 7 and 8. The probe said the fact that the seven bodies were forgotten for a week was a “severe error.”\nIn all, of the 38 terrorists who had tried to reach Israel via the sea, 14 were killed at sea, eight were killed as they reached the coast or in the beach area, and 10 were killed in later exchanges of fire, according to the probe. The final six were likely also killed, but the military was unable to fully confirm this."}

Another possibility being looked into was that a mortar struck the area.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWith the IDF set to expand its offensive in Gaza, the military said Saturday night that it was sending out tens of thousands of call-up orders to reservists, with many having likely been called up multiple times already during the war.\nSurge in aid looting\nMeanwhile Saturday, locals and aid workers said that armed groups and others have been looting warehouses of supplies in northern Gaza as desperation spikes after more than two months of Israel’s blockade of the territory.\nUnidentified people, both armed and unarmed, have been looting UN and aid groups’ warehouses, as well as bakeries and shops since Wednesday, according to witnesses, organizations in Gaza, and messages that were circulated among security officials for aid groups and were seen by The Associated Press.\nSince the beginning of March, Israel has cut off Gaza from all imports, leading to what is believed to be the most severe shortage of food, medicine, and other supplies in nearly 19 months of war with Hamas. Israel says the goal of its blockade is to pressure Hamas to free the remaining 59 hostages of the 251 taken during the terror group’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which killed some 1,200 people and started the war.\nIsrael has proposed having all aid sent through a single crossing in southern Gaza and using the military or private security contractors to deliver it to these hubs, according to the documents shared with AP and aid workers familiar with the discussions.

After failing to find a winner on the first ballot, they retired for the night and will return to the Sistine Chapel on Thursday morning to try to find a successor to Pope Francis.\nThey had opened the conclave Wednesday afternoon, participating in a rite more theatrical than even Hollywood could create, a wash of red-robed cardinals, Latin chants, incense, and solemnity that underscored the seriousness of the moment.\nOutside in St. Peter’s Square, the scene was festive, as thousands of people flocked to the piazza to watch the proceedings on giant video screens, applauding when the Sistine Chapel’s doors slammed shut and the voting began. They waited for hours, watching screens that showed just a skinny chimney and occasional seagull. After the vote dragged on to dinnertime, some left in frustration, but those who stayed cheered when the smoke finally billowed out.\n“My hope is that cardinals will choose a man who can be a peacemaker and could reunify the church,” said Gabriel Capry, a 27-year-old from London.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nA diverse group of cardinals\nHailing from 70 countries, the cardinals were sequestered Wednesday from the outside world, their cellphones surrendered and airwaves around the Vatican jammed to prevent all communications until they find a new pope.\nFrancis named 108 of the 133 “princes of the church,” choosing many pastors in his image from far-flung countries like Mongolia, Sweden, and Tonga that had never had a cardinal before.\nHis decision to surpass the usual limit of 120 cardinal electors and include younger ones from the “global south” — often marginalized countries with lower economic clout — has injected an unusual degree of uncertainty in a process that is always full of mystery and suspense.\nCardinals before the start of the conclave to elect a new Pope in the Sistine chapel in The Vatican, May 7, 2025. (Simone Risoluti / VATICAN MEDIA / AFP)\nMany cardinals hadn’t met until last week and lamented they needed more time to get to know one another, raising questions about how long it might take for one man to secure the two-thirds majority, or 89 ballots, necessary to become the 267th pope.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Wait and see, a little patience, wait and see,” said Cardinal Mario Zenari, the Vatican’s ambassador to Syria.\nThe oath and “Extra omnes”\nThe cardinals had entered the Sistine Chapel in pairs, chanting the meditative “Litany of the Saints” as Swiss Guards stood at attention. The hymn implores the saints to help the cardinals find a leader of the 1.4 billion-strong church.\nCardinal Pietro Parolin, the 70-year-old secretary of state under Francis and himself a leading contender to succeed him as pope, assumed the leadership of the proceedings as the senior cardinal under age 80 eligible to participate.\nHe stood before Michelangelo’s vision of heaven and hell, “The Last Judgment,” and led the other cardinals in a lengthy oath. Each one followed, placing his hand on the Gospel and promising in Latin to maintain utmost secrecy.\nEarlier in the day, the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, presided over a morning Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica urging the voters to set aside all personal interests and find a pope who prizes unity. He prayed for a pope who could awaken the conscience of the world.\nHe reminded the cardinals that the awesomeness of the Sistine Chapel’s frescoes is meant to remind the cardinals of the weighty responsibility they bear. In his regulations for the conclave, Re recalled, St. John Paul II wrote that in the Sistine Chapel, “everything is conducive to an awareness of the presence of God.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nCardinal Pietro Parolin at the start of the conclave to elect a new Pope in the Sistine chapel in The Vatican, May 7, 2025. (Simone Risoluti / VATICAN MEDIA / AFP)\nAfter the cardinals took their oaths, the master of papal liturgical ceremonies, Archbishop Diego Ravelli, called out “extra omnes,” Latin for “all out” and anyone not eligible to vote left before the chapel doors closed. An elderly cardinal remained to deliver a meditation, but after he finished, he too, had to leave since he was too old to vote.\nWhile cardinals this week said they expected a short conclave, it will likely take at least a few rounds of voting. For much of the past century, it has taken between three and 14 ballots to find a pope. John Paul I — the pope who reigned for 33 days in 1978 — was elected on the fourth ballot. His successor, John Paul II, needed eight. Francis was elected on the fifth in 2013.\nLobbying before the conclave\nThe cardinals are supposed to resist any “secular” influences in their choice of pope, but such lobbying abounded in Rome in the days before the conclave as various groups reminded cardinals of what ordinary Catholics want in a leader.\nYoung Catholics penned an open letter reminding cardinals that there is no church without young people, women, and the laity. Conservative Catholic media slipped cardinals copies of a glossy book containing their assessments of contenders. Survivors of clergy sexual abuse warned cardinals that they would be held accountable if they failed to find a leader who will crack down on decades of abuse and cover-up.\nAdvocates for women’s ordination sent pink smoke signals Wednesday over the Vatican to demand that women be allowed to be priests and participate in a conclave.\nEven the White House got involved, posting a photo of US President Donald Trump dressed as a pope. Trump said it was a joke, but the gesture was denounced by former Italian Premier Romano Prodi as “indecent” political interference in matters of faith that hark back to times when secular rulers intervened in conclaves.\npic.twitter.com/x2HrR939tn\n— The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 3, 2025\nADVERTISEMENT\nCardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said there was also plenty of lobbying going on among cardinals themselves.\n“You invite each other out,” Dolan said on SiriusXM’s The Catholic Channel before the conclave began. “And you’re pretty blunt. Now, we’re not, you know, we’re not horse trading here. We’re saying, ‘Tell me about this guy. You’re from Latin America. Go through the list of bishops. Tell me some of these fellas. Am I right to be enchanted by this guy?'”\nLisette Herrera, a 54-year-old tourist from the Dominican Republic, was deeply moved to find herself by chance in Rome as the conclave began. She decided Wednesday morning to skip the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain and pray instead in St. Peter’s Square.\n“I’m praying to the Holy Spirit for a young pope who would stay with us for a long time,” she said. “I don’t believe in conclave politics, I just feel that the Holy Spirit is here and that’s all we need to know.”\nChallenges facing a new pope\nMany challenges await the new pope and weigh on the cardinals — above all, whether to continue and consolidate Francis’ progressive legacy on promoting women, LGBTQ+ acceptance, the environment, and migrants, or roll it back to try to unify a church that became more polarized during his pontificate. The clergy sex abuse scandal hung over the pre-conclave talks.\nActivists release pink smoke over the Vatican to protest the male-only conclave as Roman Catholic cardinals meet to elect a successor to Pope Francis.

In addition to Parolin, they include Filipino Cardinal Luis Tagle, 67, a top candidate to be history’s first Asian pope. He headed the Vatican’s evangelization office responsible for the Catholic Church in much of the developing world.\nHungarian Cardinal Peter Erdo, 72, the archbishop of Budapest, is also a leading candidate representing the more conservative wing of the church."}

Also participating were representatives from Safe Reach Solutions and UG Solutions, two American companies who have been contracted to secure the humanitarian hubs being established in southern Gaza for the distribution of aid.\nAsked for comment on the matter, a State Department spokesperson did not deny that pressure is being applied to international organizations.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“While we don’t have anything to announce and wouldn’t speak on behalf of the foundation, we welcome moves to quickly get urgent food aid into Gaza in a way that prevents it from falling into the hands of terrorists.

State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce appeared to reference that announcement during a Tuesday briefing when she told reporters, “An important announcement regarding the entry of aid to Gaza will be issued in the next few days, and there is very good news.”\nTrump himself indicated Wednesday that there would be a Gaza-related announcement in the next 24 hours.\nIsrael is not waiting, though, and the IDF has already begun building the first of several humanitarian hubs in southern Gaza from which it plans to distribute aid to civilians in the coming weeks, with the Israeli official acknowledging that some Gazans “are on the brink of starvation.”\nDisplaced Palestinians walk through a makeshift tent camp in the Muwasi area of Khan Younis, in the Gaza Strip, on May 5, 2025. (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)\nThose hubs are being paid for by Israel, but Jerusalem is aiming for other parts of the project to be funded by foreign governments and international organizations.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Israeli official expressed optimism that some organizations will get on board with the plan, though the organizations currently involved in the Gaza humanitarian operation issued a joint statement earlier this week asserting that they will not cooperate after being briefed by Jerusalem on what it has planned.\nThe Israeli initiative will create a new humanitarian zone between the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt and the newly established Morag corridor roughly five kilometers north. The area largely constitutes the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Those entering the corridor will pass through army checkpoints in what the IDF hopes will prevent Hamas fighters from reaching the area.\nThe Israeli official said that the humanitarian zone — while making up roughly ten percent of the Strip — is large enough to house Gaza’s entire population of roughly 2 million people, though Jerusalem is also hoping some of them will be able to leave the Strip.\nThus far, however, no countries have come forward offering to take in Gazan refugees, with Israel refusing to publicly commit to allowing those who leave to return.

Five to six thousand vetted representatives will be allowed to travel by foot to the aid hubs once every two weeks in order to pick up a roughly 40-pound box of food for their families, said officials briefed on the plan.\nThe international aid group staffer said the plan does not take into account the current reality in the Strip, where hungry Gazans desperate for food are likely to flood the aid hubs once they are opened.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe staffer also took issue with the mechanism’s plan to only facilitate the entry of 60 trucks into Gaza each day from one crossing, saying the amount does not come close to what will be needed to feed the already-malnourished Gazan population.\nThe Israeli official insisted that the 60-truck figure will be sufficient to prevent starvation of Gazans."}

{"title": "Chair of UK Oct. 7 report: ‘Denial started while the massacres were still ongoing’", "date": "9 May 2025, 9:31 am", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/chair-of-uk-oct-7-report-denial-started-while-the-massacres-were-still-ongoing/", "type": "article", "content": "LONDON — With its minute-by-minute timeline, copious testimony from survivors and eyewitnesses, and wealth of forensic evidence and open-source footage, the 316-page report produced by British parliamentarians last month detailing the terrible events of October 7, 2023, is a comprehensive and meticulous account of the Hamas onslaught on Israel.\nThat is unsurprising. The panel responsible for the “7 October Parliamentary Commission Report” was chaired by Andrew Roberts, a renowned historian, biographer and expert on warfare, from the Battle of Waterloo to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\nIt isn’t simply Roberts’s longstanding support for Israel that led him to agree to chair the commission, but his concern over continuing attempts to whitewash Hamas’s atrocities — an effort he compares to Holocaust denial.\n“There’s a movement afoot on behalf of Hamas and its sympathizers to pretend that October 7 never happened,” he tells The Times of Israel. The report’s aim was to compile “a large amount of unimpeachable evidence to prove that it did.”\nWith an eye on history, Roberts also wanted to gather irrefutable proof to ensure that, in future decades, “the deniers” can still be challenged, even in the absence of living eyewitnesses.\nRoberts, who is not Jewish, does not underestimate the scale of the challenge.\n“It took decades for Holocaust denial to really get going,” he says, “but October 7 denial started while the actual massacres were still going [on].”\nHe recognizes that Hamas’s denial of its crimes contains multiple grim ironies. Pointing to the GoPro cameras worn by the terrorists as they perpetrated murder, torture and rape, he notes the group and its allies are “attempting to deny something that they themselves have provided the best evidence for.”\nRoberts also believes that Hamas is trying to “have their cake and eat it.”\n“They are trying to celebrate something they deny happened, and deny something that they’ve celebrated happening,” he says. “It’s unlike anything else, really. Speaking as a historian, you’ve got to come down on one side or the other about an occasion [or] a big historical event like October 7, and you’ve got to say that either it happened, and it was terrible, or that it didn’t happen.”\n“You can’t have it both ways, and yet that’s what Hamas and its supporters in the West are trying to get,” he adds.\nDepravity of human nature, filmed in real-time\nRoberts, who sits as a Conservative member of the House of Lords, and fellow members of the panel — who include Labour and Liberal Democrat parliamentarians and a former UK chief prosecutor — visited Israel and the scenes of some of the October 7 attacks. Roberts says it was both the “breadth as well as the depth” of the assault that struck him — not just the murder of some 1,200 people and abduction of 251, but the “depravity of human nature that was seen, the sheer cruelty, the sexual violence and the humiliation.”\nRoberts speaks of the “bloodlust” displayed by the assailants — they killed a 10-month-old baby and a Holocaust survivor in his 90s — as well as the “premeditation of the cruelty.”\nBlood is seen splattered in a child’s room following a massive Hamas terror onslaught on October 7, 2023, in Kibbutz Nir Oz, October 19, 2023 (AP/Francisco Seco)\nHistorically, he says, this is unusual. “Bloodlust happens a lot in history, but it’s very rare that it’s been set up so diligently and with such foresight — ‘malice aforethought’ as it used to be called,” he says.\nThe report of the 7 October Parliamentary commission, which was established by the All Party UK-Israel Parliamentary Group, isn’t an official publication of the House of Commons or the House of Lords. Roberts accepts that it has already been written off by some on social media as “Zionist propaganda” — the internet, he jokes, has become “the universal lavatory wall” — but he believes it cannot easily be “intellectually and rationally written off.”\n“Bloodlust happens a lot in history, but it’s very rare that it’s been set up so diligently and with such foresight — ‘malice aforethought’ as it used to be called”\nThe panel was careful to stick to verifiable facts, avoid speculation and focus simply on the events of October 7, he says.\n“We were not attempting to do what other reports could do better, which is to look into the intelligence failures and everything else that happened in the background to it,” Roberts says.\nThe report argues that Hamas knew that “military victory was unlikely” and instead sought to trigger an Israeli retaliation, which would isolate the country internationally and spark global outrage. However, Roberts disputes the notion that, on these terms, Hamas has already emerged victorious.\nIsraeli soldiers at the forensic center in the Shura military base near Ramle, where hundreds of bodies arrived after the October 7 Hamas onslaught, October 24, 2023. (Yossi Aloni/Flash90)\n“In terms of the propaganda war, I think they have won in that on these disgusting, ridiculous social media sites, like TikTok and Instagram, you’re getting… 10 times more anti-Israel propaganda than pro-Israeli facts and truth,” he acknowledges.\nBut, he continues, the war itself is not over and it won’t be possible to say either side has won until both sides have stopped fighting — a prospect that seems some way off. Indeed, quoting Winston Churchill’s famous words upon becoming UK prime minister in 1940, Roberts believes that Israel will eventually prevail, but it will take “a lot more blood, toil, tears and sweat.”\nCheckered history of surprise attacks\nRoberts’s belief that Hamas can be vanquished rests in part on the checkered history of surprise attacks. They may give the attacker a momentary advantage, but, with a “very few” exceptions — such as the 1967 Six Day War, when Israel launched a preemptive strike — they rarely lead to ultimate success. The Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Yom Kippur assault on Israel in October 1973, Argentina’s invasion of the Falkland Islands in April 1982, and Saddam Hussein’s grab for Kuwait in August 1990 did not see the aggressor triumph.\nWhile undertaking a surprise attack “seems like a good idea at the time… ultimately, it leads to a much worse situation for the people who launch [it],” believes Roberts. “If you launch a barbarous and vicious surprise attack, you shouldn’t be surprised about the response,” the historian says, noting the “holy rage and fury” that is stirred on the part of those who have been attacked.\n“If you launch a barbarous and vicious surprise attack, you shouldn’t be surprised about the response”\nThe author of an acclaimed biography of Churchill, Roberts has previously compared Israel’s position to that of Britain in 1940.\n“In that 12-month period from June 1940 to June 1941, Britain and her Commonwealth formed the tip of the spear against ‘the menace of tyranny,’ just as brave Israel today represents the tip of civilization’s spear against the tyranny and barbarism of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism and exterminationism,” he wrote in the Jewish Chronicle last October.\nRoberts readily admits, however, that Britain, which had not yet been joined by the US and Russia but had strong backing from the Empire and Commonwealth, was less alone than Israel is today. With the exception of the US, he says, “it’s difficult to look around the world and see countries that are really four-square behind Israel in what is essentially a struggle between civilization and barbarism.”\nHe worries that people in the West “enjoy attacking ourselves… and berating ourselves” for “perfectly reasonable” responses to surprise attacks such as 9/11 or October 7. He contrasts the response to Pearl Harbor.\nA handout photograph released by the UK Parliament shows Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, making a statement on the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 and the situation in the Middle East, in the House of Commons in London on October 7, 2024 (JESSICA TAYLOR / UK PARLIAMENT / AFP)\n“Nobody attacked FDR [who was US president at the outbreak of World War II], or, indeed at the time, [US] president Truman [under whose administration a nuclear bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki], for punishing the attack on Pearl Harbor as condignly as they did, whereas today, everybody seems to be leaping up and down, criticizing the West for punishing these equally horrific attacks,” Roberts says.\nNonetheless, Roberts is convinced that Churchill would have recognized and sympathized with Israel’s position today.\n“He was a Zionist. He didn’t subscribe to [the] antisemitism that so many of the people of his age, class and background did. He was a supporter of the Balfour Declaration and believed that the ‘Judeo’ side of Judeo-Christian civilization… gave Christianity its ethics and its positive moral angle,” he says.\nRoberts says that Churchill’s daughter had once warned him never to assume what the former prime minister would have said about any event after his death in 1965, but he is happy to wager an opinion.\n“It strikes me as very clear that he would have been as outraged as any other decent, rational, logical human being about what had happened on October 7, and he would certainly have been in favor of a terrible punishment raining down on Hamas,” Roberts says. “He was a humanitarian and so he’d have wanted to have minimized the civilian casualties in Gaza, and I believe that the IDF have done that to the best of their ability.”\nPerhaps, like Roberts, Churchill would also have seen a commonality between the enemy he defeated and that which Israel faces.\n“The overlap between Hamas ideology and Nazi ideology is so well colored in on the Venn diagram”\n“The overlap between Hamas ideology and Nazi ideology is so well colored in on the Venn diagram,” Roberts says.\nOf course, he adds, it is always “difficult and dangerous” to draw direct historical analogies. Hamas’s murderous rampage cannot be compared with the industrial-scale killing carried out by the Nazis, even if the former wore GoPro cameras and broadcast their “monstrous actions” on Facebook while the latter tried to cover up their crimes and destroy the gas chambers in 1945.\n“The analogy between Hamas and the Nazis strikes me as completely obvious one,” Roberts says. “I think you’d have to be deliberately obtuse not to see the connections.”\nThe Hamas attacks of October 7 and the ensuing conflict have confirmed Roberts’s belief that launching a war is a “profoundly immoral” act.\n“Wars are truly terrible things, which is why you shouldn’t start them,” he says, “and why you should fight them in as humanitarian a way as you can, which I think is what Israel has done.”"}

Among those caught in the chaos was 15-year-old Geneviève Perrier, who fled her village in northeastern France to escape the advancing German troops like millions of others. By June, France had surrendered.\nThree years later, Esther Senot, 15, was arrested by French police and deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. In 1944, 19-year-old Ginette Kolinka was sent to the same death camp.\nNow close to 100 years old, the women continue to share their stories, determined to keep the memory of the war alive and pass its lessons on to future generations.\nGeneviève Perrier, 99, a civilian under Nazi occupation\n“We were scared,” Perrier remembered as she described fleeing on a bicycle with her mother, carrying only a small travel bag, while her uncle took a horse-drawn cart on the roads of eastern France.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“There were lots of people fleeing, with kids in baby carriages, everyone was running away. There was a column of civilians fleeing and a column of French soldiers fleeing,” she said.\nNazis march on the champs Elysees Paris, France, August 2, 1940. (AP)\nPerrier and others hid in a field when they heard bomber planes. “Mom had a white hat. Some told her: ‘Remove your hat!’ And that’s when I saw a huge bomb pass over our heads. It didn’t explode. It was the chance of a lifetime.”\nLater taking a train, Perrier found refuge for a few months in a small town in southwestern France, in an area governed by the collaborationist Vichy regime, before her mother decided they would go back home — only to live under harsh Nazi occupation.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The Resistance was big in our area,” Perrier said, adding she was willing to join the so-called French Forces of the Interior (FFI). Three women from the FFI were captured and tortured by the Nazis just a few kilometers away from her home, she recalled.\n“My mother kept telling me: ‘No, I don’t want you to leave. I don’t have a husband any more, so if you go…'” she said. “She was right, because all three of them were killed.”\nStill, Perrier kept her spirit of resistance in her daily life.\n“At church, there was a Catholic hymn,” she said, singing: “Catholic and French, always!”\n“We bellowed it with all our might, hoping they (the Nazi soldiers) would hear,” she said.\nWhen the Allied forces landed on the Normandy beaches on June 6, 1944, Perrier said she didn’t have much access to news and could not believe it.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPeople attend the ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the return of death camp deportees, in Paris, France, April 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Thomas Padilla)\nLater that year, she saw the troops of General Leclerc’s 2nd French Division, equipped with American tanks, coming into her village. “They liberated us, and there was a tank that had stopped almost on our doorstep. So I went to see the tank, of course. And then, they held a ball not far away,” she said.\nTowards the end of the war, Frenchmen brought a German soldier they accused of having killed a baby to the village’s cemetery. “They made him dig his grave. They put him in it… They killed him,” she said.\nEsther Senot, 97, Holocaust survivor\nBorn in Poland to a Jewish family who emigrated to France at the end of the 1930s, Esther Senot was 15 when she was arrested in Paris by French police. She was deported in September 1943 to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp by cattle train.\nAt the ramp, the Nazis selected those they could use as forced laborers.\n“A German with his loudspeaker said: the elderly, women, children, those who are tired can get on the trucks,” she recalled. “Out of the 1,000 people we were, 650 got on the trucks…. And 106 of us, women, were selected to go back to work in the camp to forced labor.” Others were gassed to death soon after their arrival.\nSenot survived 17 months in Auschwitz-Birkenau and other camps and made it back to France at age 17.\nPeople walk with a banner reading “Inter-generation march for memory and transmission” before the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the return of death camp deportees, in Paris, France, April 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Thomas Padilla)\nIn spring 1945, the Lutetia hotel in Paris became a gathering place for those returning from the concentration camps. Senot described the crowd of people looking for missing family members, some bringing photos of their loved ones, while walls were covered with posters listing the names of survivors.\n“It was bureaucratic,” Senot said. “At the first counter, they gave us temporary identity cards. Then they gave us a fairly basic medical examination … And those who were lucky enough to find their family, they went to an office where they were given some money and were told: ‘Now you’ve completed the formalities… you go home.'”\nADVERTISEMENT\nSeventeen members of Senot’s family were killed by the Nazis during WWII, including her mother, her father and six siblings.\nIn a recent commemoration in front of the hotel, Senot said she had hoped her survival would “bear witness to the absolute crime in which we were caught.” But once back in France, she felt the hardest thing was the indifference to the fate of those who had been deported.\n“France had been liberated for one year, and people didn’t expect us to return with all the misery in the world on our shoulders,” she said.\nIn her former Parisian neighborhood, a small crowd watched her. “I weighed 32 kilos (70 pounds) when I came back, my hair was shaved. One year after the Liberation, people hadn’t met any woman looking like that.”\nSenot said when she started to explain what happened to her, “you could see the disbelief in their eyes.”\n“And suddenly they got angry. They said: ‘But you have gone mad, you are talking nonsense, it couldn’t have happened.’ And I will always remember the face of a man who looked at me and said: ‘You came back in such small numbers, what did you do to come back and not the others?'”\nGinette Kolinka, 100, Holocaust survivor\nKolinka, who was 19 when she was deported in April 1944 to Auschwitz-Birkenau, is well known in France for sharing her vivid memories of the concentration camps with the younger generation in the past two decades.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn June 1945, when she returned to Paris, she weighed only 26 kilos (57 pounds) and was very weak. Still, compared to some others, she felt “lucky” to find her mother and four sisters alive in France when coming back home. Her father, a brother, and a sister died in death camps.\nHolocaust survivor Ginette Kolinka, 100, attends a commemorative ceremony to mark the 80th anniversary of the return of death camp deportees, in Paris, France, April 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Thomas Padilla)\nShe did not speak about the war for over half a century. “Those who told their story, it’s true that it seemed unbelievable (at the time),” she said.\nSix million European Jews and people from other minorities were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust.\nIn the 2000s, Kolinka joined an association of surviving deportees and began to speak out.\n“What we have to keep in mind is that everything that happened was because one man (Adolf Hitler) hated the Jews,” she said.\n“Hatred, for me, is dangerous,” she added. “As soon as we say: that one is like this, that one is like that, it already proves that we make a difference when in reality, no matter whether we are Jews, Muslims, Christians, Blacks, we are human beings.”"}

Anno 1941, Franciszek Kempa.”\nThe origins of the violin, built in 1941 by Franciszek “Franz” Kempa while imprisoned by the Nazis at Dachau in southern Germany, remained unnoticed for decades. It wasn’t until art dealers in Hungary sent the instrument out for repairs — after having stored it for years among a set of purchased furniture — that its history came to light.\nAlthough the instrument’s craftsmanship pointed clearly to a skilled maker, the professional repairing it was puzzled by the poor quality of the wood and the crude tools used to create it, which didn’t match the evident skill involved.\n“If you look at its proportions and structure, you can see that it’s a master violin, made by a man who was proficient in his craft,” said Szandra Katona, one of the Hungarian art dealers who discovered the origins of the violin.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“But the choice of wood was completely incomprehensible.”\nThe ”violin of hope” in Magyarpolány, Hungary, September 8, 2020. (Szandra Katona / AP)\nMotivated by the contradiction, the professional disassembled the violin, revealing Kempa’s hidden note — an apparent explanation, even an apology, from a master violin maker forced by the brutal limitations of his captivity to build an instrument that fell short of his own standards.\nDachau, located near Munich, was the first concentration camp established by the Nazis in March 1933. It initially housed political prisoners but later became a model for other camps, imprisoning Jews, Roma, clergy, homosexuals and others targeted by the Nazi regime.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOver time, it became a site of forced labor, medical experiments, and brutal punishment, and remained in operation until it was liberated by American forces on April 29, 1945. At least 40,000 people are believed to have died there due to starvation, disease, execution, or mistreatment.\nThere is ample evidence that musical instruments were present in concentration camps across Central and Eastern Europe during World War II. For propaganda purposes, the Nazis often permitted or even encouraged the formation of musical groups to give a false impression to the outside world about life in the camps.\nHowever, all known instruments that survived Dachau are believed to have been brought in by prisoners. Kempa’s “violin of hope,” as it has come to be called, is the only known instrument actually built inside the camp.\nIt is unknown how the violin left Dachau and ultimately made its way to Hungary. But Kempa, according to documents provided to the Hungarian art dealers by the museum at the Dachau memorial site, survived the war and returned to his native Poland to continue making instruments before dying in 1953.\nThe documents also suggest that Kempa was known to the Nazis as an instrument maker — something Tamás Tálosi, one of the art dealers, believes may have spared him the fate of millions of others who perished in the camps.\n“We named it the ‘violin of hope’ because if someone ends up in a difficult situation, having a task or a challenge helps them get through a lot of things,” Tálosi said.\n“You focus not on the problem, but on the task itself, and I think this helped the maker of this instrument to survive the concentration camp.”"}

Aliza Sherman, a Jewish mother of four, was stabbed more than 10 times, her body found on a downtown Cleveland sidewalk near where she was set to meet Moore to discuss her divorce.\nMoore was indicted on charges of murder, aggravated murder, kidnapping and conspiracy, according to unsealed documents. He was arrested by US Marshals in Texas, and remains in custody.\nSherman was killed the night before Passover in 2013, sending shock waves through the Jewish community.

(Nic Antaya / Getty Images via AFP)\nOn Monday, Nessel said in a statement that she had filed the right charges, “and believe, based on the evidence, a reasonable jury would find the defendants guilty of the crimes alleged.” But she also said that the case had engendered a “circus-like atmosphere” and did not believe that pressing the case would be “a prudent use of my department’s resources.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nShe suggested that the JCRC statement was part of the reason she was dropping the charges.\n“The motion for recusal has been a diversionary tactic which has only served to further delay the proceedings,” she said. “And now, we have learned that a public statement in support of my office from a local non-profit has been directly communicated to the Court.”\nShe continued, “The impropriety of this action has led us to the difficult decision to drop these charges.”\nWhile Nessel didn’t directly name the JCRC or Jewish federation, federation CEO Eileen Freed believes Nessel was referring to her group. She called the fallout from the statement a “misunderstanding” — and said a logistical error may be to blame for why the statement helped quash the case.\nFreed said she believed Nessel would have been aware that the statement went out. As a “for your information,” she said, the federation also sent the statement to the court. But it may have been sent to the wrong person, Freed said.\n“The public statement was intended to be shared with the court’s public information officer and not a court administrator, and was not intended to be turned into an official court document,” she said in an interview.\nADVERTISEMENT\nShe added that she does not know in what capacity the court viewed the document, but said, “I think the fact that it was misinterpreted in that way created a misunderstanding that would have perhaps continued to detract from the case.”\nFreed said her organization has not heard from Nessel’s office since making the statement. She said she is now discussing the issue with her board and “clarifying our intent, which was not to communicate with the judge nor to influence the court.”\nAnti-Israel students protest at an encampment on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan on April 28, 2024.

Speaking up against genocide should be lifted up, not slammed with felony charges. Palestinians deserve safety + dignity.”\nBut Freed says she doesn’t regret making the statement in Nessel’s defense — even though she wishes the students had been prosecuted.\n“I regret that the circumstances have resulted in them dropping the case, but I don’t regret that we did the statement,” she said. “I think it was important. Nobody else was speaking out about a potential dangerous precedent of removing somebody from the case because of their identity.”"}

The administration previously froze $2.2 billion in federal grants to Harvard, and Trump is pushing to strip the school of its tax-exempt status.\nHarvard has pushed back on the administration’s demands, setting up a closely watched clash in Trump’s attempt to force change at universities that he says have become hotbeds of liberalism and antisemitism, the latter of which has been an issue at US campuses since the Hamas-led attack against Israel on October 7, 2023, and subsequent war in Gaza.\nIn a press call, an Education Department official said Harvard will receive no new federal grants until it “demonstrates responsible management of the university” and satisfies federal demands on a range of subjects. It applies to federal research grants and not federal financial aid students receive to help cover tuition and fees.\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the decision on a call with reporters.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe official accused Harvard of “serious failures” in four areas: antisemitism, racial discrimination, abandonment of rigor and viewpoint diversity. To become eligible for new grants, Harvard would need to enter negotiations with the federal government and prove it has satisfied the administration’s demands.\nThe Trump administration has demanded that Harvard make broad government and leadership changes, revise its admissions policy and audit its faculty and student body to ensure the campus is home to many points of view.\nPeople leave Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on April 17, 2025. (Sophie Park / GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / Getty Images via AFP)\nThe demands are part of a pressure campaign targeting several other high-profile universities. The administration has cut off money to colleges including Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell University, seeking compliance with Trump’s agenda.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe White House says it’s targeting campus antisemitism after pro-Palestinian protests against Israel swept US college campuses last year. It’s also focused on the participation of transgender athletes in women’s sports. The attacks on Harvard increasingly have called out the university’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, along with questions about freedom of speech and thought by conservatives on campus.\nIn a letter Monday to Harvard’s president, Education Secretary Linda McMahon accused the school of enrolling foreign students who showed contempt for the US.\n“Harvard University has made a mockery of this country’s higher education system,” McMahon wrote.\nHarvard’s president has previously said he will not bend to government’s demands. The university sued to halt its funding freeze last month.\nA Harvard statement Monday reiterated the university’s refusal to acquiesce and said the government was retaliating for Harvard’s lawsuit.\n“Today, we received another letter from the administration doubling down on demands that would impose unprecedented and improper control over Harvard University and would have chilling implications for higher education,” Harvard said. The university said it will “continue to defend against illegal government overreach aimed at stifling research and innovation that make Americans safer and more secure.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn a conversation with alumni last week, Harvard President Alan Garber acknowledged there was a “kernel of truth” to criticism over antisemitism, freedom of speech and wide viewpoints at Harvard. But he said the conflict with the federal government has become a threat to the school’s autonomy.\n“We were faced with a recent demand from the federal government that, in the guise of combating antisemitism, raised new issues of control that frankly we did not anticipate, getting to the heart of governance,” Garber said. “We felt that we had to take a stand.”\nStudents, faculty and members of the Harvard University community rally in Cambridge, Massachusetts, April 17, 2025. (AP)\nHarvard’s suit called the funding freeze “arbitrary and capricious,” saying it violated its First Amendment rights and the statutory provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.\nThe Trump administration said previously that Harvard would need to meet a series of conditions to keep almost $9 billion in grants and contracts.\nThe school in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has an endowment of $53 billion, the largest in the country. Across the university, federal money accounted for 10.5% of revenue in 2023, not counting financial aid such as grants and student loans.\nHarvard isn’t alone in its reliance on federal money. Universities receive about 90% of all federal research spending, taking in $59.6 billion in 2023, according to the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics.\nThat accounts for more than half the $109 billion spent on research at universities, with most of the rest coming from college endowments, state and local governments and nonprofits.\nTo make up for the loss in federal funding, McMahon on Monday suggested Harvard rely on “its colossal endowment” and raise money from wealthy alumni.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHarvard generally steers about 5% of its endowment value toward university operations every year, accounting for about a third of its total budget, according to university documents.\nThe university could draw more from its endowment, but colleges generally try to avoid spending more than 5% to protect investment gains. Like other schools, Harvard is limited in how it spends endowment money, much of which comes from donors who specify how they want it to be used."}

{"title": "Why Reconstructionist Judaism head Rabbi Deborah Waxman is stepping down after 13 years", "date": "4 May 2025, 3:57 am", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-reconstructionist-judaism-head-rabbi-deborah-waxman-is-stepping-down-after-13-years/", "type": "article", "content": "JTA — Rabbi Deborah Waxman, who leads the seminary and congregational union of Judaism’s Reconstructionist movement, said this week that she will retire in the summer of 2026, opening the top job at a movement that has been rocked by tension over a growing strain of anti-Zionism among its recent rabbinical school students and graduates.\nSince taking over as CEO of Reconstructing Judaism in 2014, Waxman has steered the main bodies of American Judaism’s smallest denomination to a firm financial footing following the post-2008 financial upheavals, and spearheaded curriculum changes at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College that beefed up field training and pastoral education for its graduates. During her tenure, the seminary also became the first rabbinical school to admit rabbis with non-Jewish partners.\nIn 2018, she led the renaming of the organization that combines, since 2012, the seminary and the former Jewish Reconstructionist Communities. She hosts a popular podcast, “Hashivenu: Jewish Teachings on Resilience,” and expanded Ritualwell, an online collection of new rituals and prayers.\nBut the movement’s reputation as organized Judaism’s progressive vanguard — pioneering the inclusion of women, LGBT people and Jews of color and embracing rituals later adopted by other liberal denominations — has been overshadowed in recent years by internal discord over Israel. Reconstructionist rabbis have taken leading roles in anti-Zionist activism, leading to public complaints by students and alumni and to the formation of Beit Kaplan, a new group of rabbis asserting their support for Israel.\nWaxman addressed those tensions last year in remarks at the seminary’s ordination ceremonies, and last July the movement issued a statement reiterating its support for progressive Zionism, the existence of Israel and the two-state solution.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nIn an interview Tuesday, Waxman emphasized her own personal commitment to Israel and the movement’s stance that it will not submit current or prospective rabbis to “litmus” tests over Zionism.\nAnd she said her decision to step down was not related to the tensions over Israel, but rather a personal decision after 13 years to hand leadership over to a new generation. (The movement has not announced a successor.)\n“I deeply believe that institutions need to renew themselves, and that a change in leadership helps toward that renewal,” said Waxman, 58. “When my contract concludes in August of 2026, I will have served 13 years, almost a generation, and I really believe in raising up the next generation of leaders, and so [I’m] stepping aside for the vitality of the Reconstructionist movement.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nTalk of generational change came up frequently in a conversation held shortly before the movement was to announce her decision. Ordained as a rabbi by the RRC in 1999, Waxman said she studied in Israel when the potential of the Oslo Accords was “still at hand.”\n“The Reconstructionist movement had long been in support of a two-state solution, and many of our leaders were involved from the time when Jews paid a very high price to advocate for Palestinian national aspirations,” she said.\nFor younger Jews, such ideals seem like ancient history, especially following the shocks of the Hamas-led terror onslaught on southern Israel of October 7, 2023, and the war in Gaza that continues to grind on.\n“Thirty years later, the young folks in the Reconstructionist movement have largely come up with the dismantlement of Oslo under Netanyahu’s leadership, with brief interruptions, and with the building of the separation barrier, and with an ever-worsening situation for Palestinians with no political will to really address it,” said Waxman, who holds a PhD in American Jewish history from Temple University. “The realities of Israel and what has gone on in Israel have something to do with the experience of young folks and their differing analyses.”\nActivists with the pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel groups Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow hold a rally demanding a ceasefire in Gaza in the rotunda of the Cannon House Office Building on October 18, 2023, in Washington, DC. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images/AFP)\nRather than shun the Reconstructionist rabbis who have joined anti-Zionist movements such as Jewish Voice for Peace, Waxman said her approach has been to engage them in a process of dialogue and mutual learning she calls “covenantal community.”\n“We’re in the vanguard because of our commitment to complexity and nuance and our willingness to have really hard conversations. How we are navigating all of the complexities of the current moment is yet another way that the Reconstructionist movement is leading, and I would love for people to see that in our efforts to create a covenantal community,” she said. “What we are trying to do is stay together with integrity and with courage.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nReconstructionist Judaism emerged out of the teachings of Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan (1881–1983), a Conservative rabbi who conceived Judaism as an evolving “civilization” rather than just a religion. That framing allowed the movement, which coalesced in the 1950s and opened its own seminary in 1968, to innovate in ways that the Conservative movement considered a breach of halacha, or Jewish law. The college, based in the Philadelphia area, accepted its first woman rabbinical student in its second class, 16 years before the Conservative movement followed suit. Waxman is herself the first woman and the first out LGBTQ person to lead a congregational union or seminary affiliated with one of the Jewish denominations.\nToday, the movement counts 94 Reconstructionist congregations; this year, RRC will ordain 10 rabbis, of whom a third or so will seek pulpit positions. The others expect to find work on college campuses, as chaplains or as what Waxman calls “entrepreneurial” rabbis.\nHaving herself grown up in the Conservative movement — where rabbis were often considerably more observant of Jewish law and custom than most of their congregants — Waxman says that in the spirit of Kaplan, she has led efforts to orient the movement “toward the lived experience of people on the ground,” as opposed to a top-down approach.\nEleven graduates of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College were ordained as rabbis in a ceremony in Abingdon, Pennsylvania, May 19, 2024. (Stephen Silver/ JTA)\n“Reconstructionism has been so deeply informed by an embrace of democracy, which includes a powerful partnership between rabbis and lay people, and the understanding that in communities a rabbi exists as a  leader, a teacher, an interpreter, as an empower, as a facilitator — as the first among equals in all of the different expressions of the Jewish civilization.”\nThe “lived experience” model led the RRC, in 2015, to accept rabbinical students in interfaith relationships. (Hebrew College, a pluralistic seminary, followed suit in 2023, as did Hebrew Union College, the Reform movement seminary, last year.) Critics said rabbis need to be role models who demonstrate the Jewish norm of in-marriage. Proponents said rabbis could better serve their communities by reflecting the demographic reality of increasing mixed marriages.\n“We heard some anxiety, including from some folks who were partnered with non-Jews, but overwhelmingly, we heard from people who said, ‘Thank you so much for validating my life, and thank you so much for seeing me and for believing that that that I am no less Jewish,’” Waxman said.\nThat conception of the rabbi as facilitator has led to criticism that the movement refuses to set firm boundaries of what is and isn’t acceptable Jewish belief and practice — criticism that Waxman accepts with pride.\n“The idea of who sets the boundaries and how they get policed is an unhealthy and unhelpful conversation,” she said. “I’m much more interested in the generative conversation. I’m much more interested in, ‘What are we building? What are we committed to? What are we trying to drive for?’”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThat approach has extended to Israel. Last December, responding to the previous year’s divides over Israel, the movement hosted a “convening” of some 600 movement rabbis, professionals and lay people. In careful language, Waxman and many of the speakers sought to avoid a debate over “Zionism” and focus instead on “values” articulated in her opening remarks: “a commitment to worldwide Jewish peoplehood,” “all humans are created b’tzelem elohim, in the image of God,” “the centrality of democracy and justice, the affirmation of self-preservation and the importance of accountability and reconciliation.”\nSimilarly, during an intensive summer in Israel, rabbinical students are encouraged to engage with Israeli and Palestinian activists and NGOs working on the ground on issues that reflect that set of largely liberal values, and not on politics.\nIllustrative photo of rabbis on stage at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College’s 2013 graduation ceremony (Courtesy of RRC/Jewish Reconstructionist Communities/JTA)\n“What we are most interested in at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College when we’re training our rabbis is behavior,” said Waxman. “How do we interact with each other, what is the kind of care we provide and the kind of capacity to see the humanity and the pain and the aspirations of the person in front of us?”\n“And sometimes I’m talking about Palestinians, but sometimes I’m talking about the young person sitting opposite me, or someone who holds a different opinion than I do,” she added. “I just think that these are essential skills for us to learn,” she said.\nFor some in the movement, this kind of openness sanctions behavior that is beyond the pale. Last May, in an oped in the Forward, two rabbinical students said they withdrew from the seminary because they “experienced an increasingly vociferous anti-Zionism among the student body, the steady erosion of civil discourse and the seminary’s inability to transmit the Jewish narrative to those it will ordain as future spiritual leaders of the Jewish people.”\nWaxman insists, however, that rather than “retreat into rigid orthodoxies” and expelling students over their beliefs about Israel, she prefers an approach of dialogue and acknowledging differences.\n“There’s a huge generational component to what’s going on, and I think that we’re so much better served being in conversation with each other and articulating the things that we are most interested in investing in,” she said. “That is a much richer conversation, full of potential, than talking about who’s out and who’s in.”"}

In recent years, Los Angeles has been the site of dueling pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests, along with violent scuffles between demonstrators. In early 2023, a man targeting Jews in the city shot two men exiting a synagogue on consecutive days. Later that year, there was a home invasion in Los Angeles that appears to have been motivated by antisemitism.\n“It’s terrifying.

He was bound and beaten to death inside his home in the Woodland Hills neighborhood. He was a 47-year-old Israeli who had been living in the United States for 15 years, according to what neighbors told the Jewish Journal.\nLAPD later announced the arrest of three suspects in Modebadze’s murder, all Georgian nationals, with the help of the FBI Fugitive Task Force: Paata Kochyashvili, 38, Zaza Otarashvili, 46, and Besiki Khutsishvili, 52.

Hidra, a businessman known as Menny, has been identified as the brother of the warden of Israel’s Nitzan Prison, Moshe Hidra, according to the Jewish Journal.\nThe LAPD has released footage of a person it believes broke into Hidra’s apartment from an adjacent vacant unit.

Political leaders speaking out against Israel were accused of bolstering anti-Jewish sentiments, as were the United Nations, the TikTok social network, and Columbia University.\nSeveral organizations have documented a sharp rise in antisemitic rhetoric and actions after Hamas mounted its shock assault on Israel on October 7, 2023, killing more than 1,200 people and kidnapping 251. The Diaspora Ministry report, in contrast, devoted much of its focus to assigning blame to different entities for allowing hate speech and activity to persist and went further than others in linking anti-Israel sentiment to antisemitism.\n“This shocking data highlights the ongoing failure of international institutions and many Western countries,” Diaspora Minister Amichai Chikli said in a press release. “The Israeli government will not hesitate to point out those who encourage antisemitism – be it governments, universities, or social networks.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe report synthesized data from various sources, including watchdog organizations like the Anti-Defamation League and UN Watch, global research institutions, and Jewish umbrella organizations in different countries, the ministry said.\nThe publication comes just over a month after the ministry was lambasted for embracing far-right European politicians and disparaging left-wing organizations at an international conference on combating antisemitism it organized in Jerusalem.\nAmichai Chikli, minister of Diaspora affairs and social equality, arrives for the weekly cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem on May 14, 2023. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nWhile the ministry devoted a handful of pages to the Arab and Muslim world, where accusations of endemic antisemitism persist, the lion’s share of the report focuses on the West; Iran, where some 8,000 Jews live under the regime’s Islamist repression, is mentioned only in the context of Tehran’s support for anti-Israel activities and terror.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn Canada, the report found a “significant increase in antisemitic incidents in intensity and forms not previously seen” in the country following October 7, 2023, counting a 670 percent jump in anti-Jewish incidents over the previous year.\n“In 2024, Canada earned the dubious distinction as ‘champion of antisemitism,” a ministry press release accompanying the report read.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (left) and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau walk on a dock of the harbor on September 26, 2024 in Montreal. (Ludovic Marin/AFP)\nFormer Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau’s condemnation of Israel at the United Nations in December 2023, just two months after the October 7 massacre, helped fuel that country’s rampant Jew-hatred, the report alleged.\nTrudeau stepped down from his position in January 2025, and was replaced by Liberal Mark Carney in national elections last week.\nCanada has made efforts to quell rising antisemitism within its borders, although Jewish groups say much more is needed.\nIn Australia, where a string of arson attacks and other vandalism at synagogues and elsewhere has shaken the Jewish community, the report recorded a 320% jump in antisemitic incidents compared to the months before the October 7 Hamas attack.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA member of the Jewish community reads messages attached to a fence where flowers have been left at the Adass Israel Synagogue in the Melbourne suburb of Ripponlea on December 9, 2024. (Martin KEEP / AFP)\nIn the United States, antisemitic incidents rose by 200%, the report said.\nThe report also quoted from surveys showing many European Jews fearing for their future in the Continent. A CRIF poll cited in the study found 64% of French citizens believe Jews have valid reasons to fear living there. In Germany, the ADL found that 80% of Jews reported feeling less safe, while in Britain, 90% of Jewish respondents told the Campaign Against Antisemitism that they avoid city centers during anti-Israel demonstrations.\nThe report largely tied countries’ responses to antisemitism to the level of official criticism aimed at the Jewish state.\nSouth Africa, Ireland and Spain were all highlighted for unfriendly stances toward Israel, which the ministry alleged heightened uneasiness among Jews there.\n“Their asymmetrical application of normative principles directly undermines Jewish communities’ senses of belonging and security within these societies, as documented through both quantitative and qualitative research,” the report said.\nFrance, Britain, Canada and Australia were described as “morally ambiguous” for taking steps to fight antisemitism while simultaneously criticizing Israel to a “disproportionate” extent, endangering local Jewish communities.\nThe report accused French President Emmanuel Macron of helping legitimize antisemitic rhetoric from France’s far-left by making harmful statements about Israel’s military actions in Gaza.\nProtesters hold placards which reads “Do not sacrifice French jews” and “LFI lights the match to antisemitic rapists” as they gather to condemn the alleged antisemetic gang rape of a 12 year-old girl, during a rally on Lyon Terreaux square in Lyon, central eastern France, on June 19, 2024. (Jean-Philippe Ksiazek/AFP)\nIn the UK, the Labour government was criticized for its arms embargo against Israel, and the state-owned broadcaster BBC was called out for refusing to call Hamas members “terrorists” and for covering up antisemitic complaints.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOnly the United States and Germany were recognized as fully supporting the fight against antisemitism in the report.\nInternational organizations were criticized for maintaining a double standard on Israel compared to the rest of the world. In 2024, the United Nations General Assembly passed 17 resolutions condemning Israel, and only six against all other countries combined, the report said.\nThe International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which the report urged governments worldwide to adopt, says criticism of Israel that places a double standard on the country is a form of anti-Jewish hate.\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa, first row left, listens in Johannesburg on January 26, 2024, to the ruling from the top UN court that harshly criticized Israel’s war against the Hamas terror group in Gaza. (AP Photo)\nThe report also backed the government’s contention that cases against Israel in the the Hague are antisemitic. Arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes in Gaza were listed in the report as “among the most severe antisemitic incidents of 2024.”\nICC prosecutor Karim Khan has vociferously denied antisemitic motivations.\nOn social media, TikTok was singled out as a major source of antisemitic content, with the report quoting a former senior official at TikTok Israel who called the platform an “existential danger to Israel.”\nMany of the people responsible for TikTok’s advertising policies support Hamas, the Houthis, and other terrorist organizations, while Israel’s sponsored campaigns on the short-form video platform have all been blocked, the report alleges.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTikTok has said it works to block hate speech on its platform. The social network, which features short-form videos, has initiated several projects to promote Holocaust remembrance on its site, among other causes.\nAnti-Israel demonstrators at Columbia University Campus unfurl a banner as they barricade themselves inside Hamilton Hall, naming it after a Palestinian child allegedly killed by the Israel in Gaza amid the ongoing war with Hamas, April 30, 2024 in New York City. (Alex Kent/Getty Images via AFP)\nThe report noted that all major social media networks, including TikTok, made efforts to curb antisemitic messaging after the October 7 attack.\nHowever, these efforts have been insufficiently enforced. During the most recent US elections, Instagram removed 40% of antisemitic content from its platform, Facebook removed 24%, X removed 22%, and TikTok removed just 17%, the report claims.\nAccording to the report, 2,087 antisemitic incidents were recorded on college campuses between June 2023 and May 2024, 477% more than a year earlier.\nColumbia University in New York was labeled the most antisemitic campus in the US, with 127 antisemitic incidents in 2024, of which 90% were linked with far-left movements. UCLA earned a distant second with 63 incidents, followed by the University of Michigan (35) and Harvard University (32), according to data from the Amcha Initiative cited in the report."}

Portnoy said he hoped it would be a “learning experience,” rather than strictly punitive, and urged his followers to stand down amid the online fracas.\nThe bar said in a statement it was “saddened, embarrassed, and frustrated by the deplorable actions of a customer and misguided staff.”\nTemple University president John Fry called the incident “deeply disturbing” and vowed further disciplinary action for anyone involved.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“I’ve been shaking, I’ve been so fucking mad,” said a red-faced Portnoy, whose bro-culture website reaches millions each month, in a video posted to X on Sunday.\n“I have just sat, and for the last two hours, I have been on the trail,” he said. “You think I’m going to put up with this shit at my bar?”\nEmergency Press Conference – There was a “Fuck the Jews” sign at our Philly bar last night.

They were drunk. It’s like, do you really want to ruin someone’s life?” he said. “Let’s try to turn a hideous incident into maybe a learning experience.”\n“We’re going to send these kids to Auschwitz, and they’re going to do a tour of the concentration camps in Germany and hopefully learn something, and maybe their lives aren’t ruined, and most people see it’s not just words you’re throwing around — so to me, that’s a fair outcome of this event.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThere’s a lesson everyone needs to learn from this, if you haven’t already.

Someone walked it through a crowd that cheered, filmed,… pic.twitter.com/ZxrPCyEWlL\n— liv (@livlayne_) May 5, 2025\nThe Barstool founder’s insistence on consequences was applauded online — though some who praised Portnoy’s righteous indignation at first said they were disappointed by his decision to take a reparative approach.\nShlomo Litvin, a prominent Chabad rabbi based in Kentucky, said on X, “Touring a Nazi Polish death camp, controlled by the Polish government alone, does little to combat antisemitism.\n“Don’t take them to Poland. Bring them to a Nova exhibit. Have them sit through the Israeli government footage. Have them speak to a survivor of both the Holocaust and Nova, then bring them to a Chabad House for a class and to a Friendship circle to volunteer for a few dozen hours,” he said.\n“I can do both,” Portnoy responded.\nEmergency Press Conference – I’m sending the people who ordered the “Fuck Jews” signs at my bar to Auschwitz to learn about the Holocaust.

US Rep. Elise Stefanik, a conservative firebrand from New York who’s made antisemitism a focus, called Portnoy “an American icon.”\nUS Senator Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania commended Portnoy “for not only immediately working to address the horrific display of hate… but also using it as an opportunity to educate on the tragic history of anti-Jewish hatred and violence.”\nJason Holtzman of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia condemned the incident at the bar and told CBS news, “Ever since [October 7, 2023] we’ve really seen an uptick of hate against Jewish people, vandalism of Jewish institutions, it’s really a disturbing sign of the times.”\nAnti-Jewish hate crimes have surged worldwide in the year and a half since the Hamas terror group attacked Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, starting the ongoing war in Gaza."}

Her fears stemmed in part from personal fallout after October 7, when, she said, “My best friend of 10 years told me we couldn’t be friends anymore.” The experience made her cautious about whom she trusted with news of her decision to enlist.\n“People I sat in classes with, that I studied and learned with, cheered for ‘armed resistance’ while vandalizing our hostage posters with swastikas,” Rebecca said.  Moving to Israel and enlisting “was the only thing in the world that made sense to me,” she added.\nShe was referring to the widespread “KIDNAPPED” posters created to spotlight the hostages abducted on October 7, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists invaded southern Israel, slaughtering some 1,200 people and kidnapping 251 to the Gaza Strip.

She argued that a formal state commission of inquiry was the most appropriate body to handle the probe and that delaying a decision on the matter was harmful.\nLater Monday, following a cabinet meeting on the matter, the government decided not to establish a state commission, explaining that the day before, it had approved expanding the military campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip and “it was not the time” for such a probe, according to Hebrew media reports.\nThe cabinet instead decided to advance legislation to establish a “special” state commission of inquiry which would, it said, enjoy “broad public trust,” Ynet reported.\nOther Hebrew media reports were less definitive. Haaretz said merely that several cabinet ministers expressed a readiness in principle to advance legislation allowing for the establishment of a “special” state commission, whose members would be appointed in a different manner from how a regular state commission of inquiry is appointed.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nAt present, the members of a state commission of inquiry are appointed by the Supreme Court president, but several cabinet members made hostile comments regarding current president Isaac Amit, and said the chair of the commission who appoints its members should be approved by a two-thirds majority in Knesset, Channel 12 reports.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly ruled out investigating October 7 until the war is over and has firmly rejected establishing a state inquiry at all, claiming half of the public would not have faith in its findings.\nCritics have alleged he seeks to establish a panel with fewer powers than a state commission and with representatives of his own choosing, because he fears a state commission — which would typically be headed by a retired Supreme Court justice — would implicate him in the disaster.

(Yossi Aloni/Flash90)\nOther public commissions, such as a governmental commission of examination, can be appointed, but they have narrower powers than a state commission and are seen as more political since their members are appointed by the government.\nThe cabinet meeting was prompted by a High Court of Justice order earlier this year that the government tell it how it intends to investigate the catastrophic terrorist attack.\nThe court told the government in February to provide it with an update by May 11, in the framework of petitions to the court asking that it order the government to open a state commission of inquiry into the catastrophic attack, something the government has strenuously resisted doing.\nWriting earlier to the prime minister and the cabinet, Baharav-Miara said she believes a state commission of inquiry is the best framework for such an investigation due to the powers such a commission would wield in gathering information, and the transparent nature of its work.\n“Other mechanisms do not fit the nature of the events being investigated, among other things, given their dependence on the political echelon, whose role in the events also requires examination,” she clarified.\nThere is, she said, no disagreement that the events of October 7 need to be investigated; the question is only on what form it will take and when.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBaharav-Miara stressed it is crucial that the investigation into the events be “severed” from the political echelon “in everything to do with the ability to get at the truth,” and in order to ensure trust in the results of the probe.\n“The government must take a reasoned decision… and it must present its reasoning in the framework of the notice that it will provide to the court dealing with the issue,” the attorney general said.\nShe added that by refraining from making a decision, the government was “causing damage and harming getting to the truth.”\nOpposition Leader Yair Lapid gives a press conference on May 4, 2025 (Screen grab)\nFollowing the cabinet meeting, Opposition Leader Yair Lapid said the implication of failing to establish a state commission will be that “the catastrophe of October 7 will happen again and again,” adding “if we do not investigate what led to the disaster we will not be able to learn the lessons and ensure that it won’t happen again.”\nLeader of the opposition National Unity party MK Benny Gantz said in a statement that the time to set up a state commission of inquiry “was more than a year ago” and that “every moment it is delayed the security of the state is harmed.”\n“The public isn’t stupid,” he said. “The only reason that a state inquiry commission is not established is the attempt to escape responsibility.”\nHawkish MK Avigdor Liberman, leader of the opposition Yisrael Beytenu party, said that Netanyahu “is afraid of a state commission of inquiry. The truth will come to light, with him or without him.”\nAccording to unsourced Hebrew media reports, during the meeting, ministers vented against Baharav-Miara and the High Court, expressing their lack of trust in both, and the latter’s objectivity in choosing members for a commission.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCommunications Minister Shlomo Karhi said it is the High Court that should be investigated, the Kan public broadcaster reported.\nFar-right Settlements and National Missions Minister Orit Strock said that it is “important that the government establish an inquiry committee and say what its mandate is,” the outlet said without citing sources.\nHamas terrorists abduct soldiers from an army base next to the Erez Crossing, on October 7, 2023, in footage released by the terror group.

Ministers reportedly suggested that the panel should only be set up after a chair is chosen with the backing of 80 out of the Knesset’s 120 MKs, an arrangement that would give both the coalition and opposition a veto on any candidate.\nAlmost 19 months after the onslaught, the government hasn’t said what sort of inquiry it supports, and hasn’t taken any steps to form one.\nHamas terrorists chase after Israelis at the entrance to Kibbutz Alumim in southern Israel on October 7, 2023.

While it is not clear what assurances Israel gave the court, the ICC did eventually issue warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant.\nBaharav-Miara’s letter to the government came as the cabinet seeks to oust her from her job. Ministers voted unanimously in March for a no-confidence motion against Baharav-Miara, in a move designed by the government to hasten her dismissal from office, citing repeated differences of opinion with the attorney general that it says have prevented effective cooperation.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn February, Likud MK Ariel Kallner unveiled what appeared to be the party’s outline for an alternative probe into the events of October 7.\nAccording to Kallner’s plan, members of the new investigatory body would not be chosen by the president of the Supreme Court — as is the case with a state commission of inquiry — but would instead be appointed by the Knesset.\nState commissions of inquiry have been established in the past to look into other military failures, including the events of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 and the Sabra and Shatila massacre in Lebanon in 1982.\nA government commission of inquiry, in which the government appoints the members of the commission, was established to investigate the failures of the 2006 Second Lebanon War, although it was granted some of the powers of the more rigorous and independent state commissions, including the power to subpoena witnesses."}

The suspect, a man in his 30s, was arrested in late March during a raid of his home. He was subsequently released from police custody but remains a suspect in the case.\nThe trainer is reported to be a prominent figure on social media with several celebrity clients, including a former prime minister.\n“I’ve decided to tell the truth. I’m not the one who needs to hide,” Schem told Channel 12 at the beginning of what was her first interview since coming forward as the complainant in the case.\nSchem said that being sexually assaulted “was always my biggest fear in life. Before captivity, during captivity, and it happened to me after captivity, in my home, in my safest place.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nIn March, the network reported that police were probing whether the trainer had used a date-rape drug. Schem’s friends allegedly found her at her home after she had spent time socially with the trainer and another person, with only a hazy memory of what had taken place.\nIsraeli hostage Mia Schem is transferred to Red Cross custody by Hamas terrorists, in Gaza City, ahead of her return to Israel, November 30, 2023. (Telegram screen capture: Used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)\nShe was then taken to the hospital for a medical examination, which determined that she recently had sex — something she had no memory of, according to the report.\n“The thing that maddens me the most is the thought that I don’t remember. I don’t know what happened. My body remembers. My body feels everything, but it took me three days to connect my physical feelings to [my awareness].”\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to Channel 12, Schem and the trainer met at a Purim party in March. “His studio is very close to where I live, and I understood that he’s very well-known in his field,” she said.\nSchem reportedly had three training sessions with the trainer in the following weeks. The suspect also talked with Schem about his own emotional state and personal issues.\nAt one point, the trainer reportedly offered to connect Schem with a “Hollywood movie producer” who was interested in meeting her.\n“I’m writing a book and — especially after what I went through — there are a lot of people who want to take my story and build something out of it, so to me it seemed completely normal,” Schem told Channel 12.\nSchem reportedly waited for two hours at a hotel to meet the producer, but he did not arrive. A second meeting was then set up at her home.\n“I told my best friend the night before: ‘There will be a meeting at my place on Sunday with a senior Hollywood movie producer, and it’s important to me that you be by my side at home,'” Schem recalled.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTwo hours after the agreed-upon time, the trainer arrived on his own. He aggressively told Schem’s friend, Abie, to leave the apartment because of the importance of the meeting, the network said.\n“From the moment he entered, I don’t remember anything,” Schem said.\nAbie recalled to Channel 12 that she didn’t think something was off after being told to leave, but that when she returned, “Mia was already not herself.”\n“I don’t even remember how I opened the door [for Abie],” Schem said… The only thing I remember from that day is that I’m sitting in front of [the trainer]. I’m very hazy, and he understands that something happened to me.”\nMia Schem (C, in gray jacket) with her family at the Sheba Medical Center in Tel HaShomer, after being released from Hamas captivity, December 1, 2023. (Courtesy)\nShe texted the trainer the following day, asking if everything had been okay during the meeting, and the suspect responded affirmatively, Channel 12 said.\nThe network revealed security camera footage from the building that showed the trainer arriving at 4:00 p.m. and another man — who was not a Hollywood producer —  arriving at 6:30 p.m. The second man, whose identity is unclear but reportedly resides in the US, left the building from the back door an hour later, and the trainer left 20 minutes afterward.\nSchem’s family reportedly noticed she was acting differently after the incident. “My older brother told me: ‘What do you have? What’s gotten into you? What’s going on with you?’ He tells me: ‘You look like you did after your captivity,'” Schem recalled. “I looked empty, and I couldn’t stop crying. I didn’t understand why I was crying, and I didn’t put it all together.”\nSchem said she then began to gradually recall details from the event, including of the trainer walking into her closet while she was getting dressed. “Another flash I have is that I’m not completely dressed, and there really is another person at home, but I don’t know how I got from place to place.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nSchem consulted with a friend of hers, who is a former addict, who told her she had been drugged. Schem then underwent tests that confirmed she had been raped.\n“This was my biggest fear my whole life, and suddenly I understand, in the current situation, that I can’t get up. I can’t get over it,” Schem said.\nThe suspect initially told investigators he had never entered Schem’s bedroom — where she alleges he raped her — at any point during the night in question.\nDuring a cross-examination in early April, however, he reportedly changed his story and said that he did enter Schem’s room while she was changing clothes because he wanted to check the address of the apartment to send it to the third person joining them that night.\nBut according to Schem, Ynet reported, the trainer already had her address, having navigated to the apartment thanks to a text she sent him with it.\n“The last thing I wanted was a saga like this,” Schem told Channel 12. “I need quiet to process my life. I haven’t yet begun processing my captivity. ”\n“In captivity in Hamas’s tunnels, without a (working) arm, I had hope. But now all of a sudden, I’m in darkness.”\nBut when asked if she has the strength to continue, Schem answered: “I don’t have a choice. That’s probably my essence. I probably have a purpose in this world. And there are 59 more hostages. I don’t forget for a moment that there are still hostages in Gaza. That’s more important than anything.”"}

Glotman and curator Gilad Reich created the exhibit of 120 stills, which opened on April 14 (through October 14), and offers a snapshot of Israel some 12 years after statehood.\n“There was this rumor that Chris Marker took all these photos of Israel,” said Reich, who began working at the museum two and a half years ago, “and I said, ‘Okay, maybe one day I’ll have time to look for them.'”\nADVERTISEMENT\nBy chance, Glotman and Reich met soon after Reich began his curatorial position.\nGlotman asked Reich if he knew of Chris Marker, who had died in 2012. “I right away asked him, ‘Have you found the stills?'” recalled Reich.\nGlotman had been searching for the stills for a decade, until Lia Van Leer told him to check with the French Cinematheque. It took the arthouse theater another four years to locate the stills, which were stored in a box with the word “Israel” scrawled on top.\nThe pair, working with the museum, obtained permission from Marker’s family and put together the exhibit, dividing the long-missing stills into several sections: Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, south, north and photos of the production.\nThe entire exhibit offers a view of Israel from more than 60 years ago, at a time when the tensions of capitalism vied with the local love of nature and the biblical land, said Reich.\nMarker was an insightful photographer, as is apparent in the photographs exhibited, from his look at ordinary people to the icons and symbols seen in their towns and cities.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAt the Israel Museum exhibit ‘Chris Marker: The Lost Photographs of Israel’ through October 2025 (Jessica Steinberg/Times of Israel)\n“He was interested in the symbols, in [Theodor] Herzl as an icon, featured in posters, or in the menorahs situated above buildings,” said Reich. “Those were the tensions that interested him.”\nMarker called Israel the “land of signs,” whether in a highway sign warning of camels as one ambled by, or by talking about Israel’s population growth while showing a pregnant woman walking down the street.\nHe was also familiar with the recent history of the Jews and understood that Israel was a country forged from the ashes of the Holocaust.\n“A generation came to forget,” says Marker in his voiceover in the film.\nSome of the photos in the exhibit have never been seen before, including public relations photos of the film that had been in the possession of Wim and Lia Van Leer, Israeli movie aficionados who eventually founded the country’s Cinematheque theaters.\nThe Van Leers also had two self-portraits of Marker, including one taken in the Van Leer apartment in Haifa as well as a photo of the younger Van Leers sitting with friends in a Haifa pub.\nLia Van Leer, top left, during the filming of Chris Marker’s film, part of the Israel Museum exhibit ‘Chris Marker: The Lost Photographs of Israel’ through October 2025 (Jessica Steinberg/Times of Israel)\nMarker came to Israel at the invitation of the Van Leers, as the pair had a vision of what they wanted in the documentary.\n“They saw one of Marker’s films in 1959 about Siberia, and they wanted a film like that about Israel,” said Reich. “Something artistic and without clichés, without tractors and the Jewish National Fund, or hospitals or government ministers at ceremonies.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nMarker agreed, demanding a month on location in Israel on his dime. He requested a Vespa for use in January 1960, with plans to travel from north to south.\nHe eventually built the script for “Description of a Struggle” based on his stills, which are nearly all featured in the film, winning first prize in the Berlin International Film Festival before the two countries even had diplomatic relations.\nExhibit cases also include faxes exchanged between Marker and Lia Van Leer and clips from other landmark film projects inspired by Marker’s work, including “In Jerusalem” (1963) by David Perlov and Dan Geva’s “Description of a Memory” (2006), a visual interpretation of Marker’s film that was enthusiastically approved by the French director.\nGeva’s film so impressed Marker that the two films are now always screened together in a “double feature,” said Reich.\nA full screening of “Description of a Struggle,” with a voiceover by Marker, is shown at the end of the exhibit.\n(The Jerusalem Cinematheque, founded by the Van Leers, offers a full screening of the film online, after registering for free with the site.)"}

Wizz Air said it was extending the suspension through May 11 at least.

Hopes for a sustained ceasefire-hostage release deal and a seemingly gradual reduction in tensions earlier this year prompted many major foreign airlines, including British Airways, Ryanair, and US carriers Delta and United Airlines, to resume part of their flight services to and from Israel in recent weeks, albeit with limited capacity and frequency.\n“We have been in a dynamic situation for a long time, which requires customers, both private and business, to prepare for different scenarios,” said Ben Natan. “This means first and foremost consulting with the travel agent or other relevant factors who are familiar with the situation regarding the status of the flights and the chances of a possible cancellation.”\n“Then, adding flexibility measures and insurance for all elements of the trip, which the vast majority of customers purchase in advance,” she recommended."}

They also led Microsoft Azure’s Cloud Security Group.\nHoring said he visits Israel several times a year to attend board meetings of local companies the fund has invested in, and meet up with Israeli entrepreneurs and CEOs, as well as with founders of prospective startups. The current visit is Horing’s third since war broke out following the onslaught by the Hamas terror group on southern communities on October 7, 2023.\n“Israel has a really good entrepreneurial culture – it’s as good as Silicon Valley in every way,” said Horing. “You have the military, and certain industries like cyber, that keep [Israel] ahead of the world.”\n“If anything, we are doing more in Israel than in California at this point…Our success rate in Israel has been astronomically good, but we have also been through a few failures,” he remarked.\nWhile investment into high-growth, software technology companies drove much of Insight’s activity over the years, Horing said that Insight has also set its sights on backing young Israeli startups and has shifted its focus to early-stage and Series A funding rounds.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“My first passion is for companies that are solving a difficult problem that’s substantive,” said Horing. “Israel has got just tons of smart folk who are thinking about exactly that kind of issue.”\nLeft: Founders of US-Israeli cyber unicorn Wiz (from left to right): VP Product Yinon Costica, CEO Assaf Rappaport, CTO Ami Luttwak, and VP R&D Roy Reznik.

Glancing ahead, though, they warn that the challenges in sustaining the foundations of the tech sector — the economy’s beating heart — are piling up.\n“Israel’s innovation economy stands at a critical juncture after more than 18 months of war, which tested the entire ecosystem — infrastructure, capital, talent and trust,” said Startup Nation Central CEO Avi Hasson. Startup Nation Central is a nonprofit that promotes Israel’s tech ecosystem.\n“Israeli tech has proven its strength and resilience, but the next phase will require more than resilience. It will demand strategic action — talent development, sector diversification and alignment between innovation and national priorities,” Hasson said.\nOver the last 19 months, Israeli startups have been grappling with the ongoing callup of employees to perform reserve duty, staff shortages, and funding woes amid the continued uncertainty about the duration and extent of the war, which broke out after Hamas-led terrorists invaded southern Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7, 2023, massacring some 1,200 people and kidnapping 251.\nSign up for the Tech Israel Daily\nand never miss Israel's top tech stories\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nIsrael’s economy grew by around 1% in 2024, down from 1.8% in 2023 and 6.3% in 2022, before the outbreak of the war with Hamas. The growth rate last year surpassed forecasts even as the fighting with Hamas and the Iran-backed Hezbollah group led to increased government spending on military and civilian needs and took a toll on exports and investments.\nTech workers march in Tel Aviv to protest against the government’s planned overhaul of the judicial system, January 31, 2023. (Tomer Neuberg/Flash90)\nOne of the key reasons for this is that the nation’s tech economy has continued to lure foreign investors despite local entrepreneurs registering their companies abroad and many firms moving part of their workforce outside the country. Similarly, the economy quickly recovered from the worst recession ever, wrought by the deadly COVID-19 pandemic, with the booming tech industry leading the charge.\n“The tech industry has managed to stay and is still the most attractive part of the Israeli economy, as most of the capital inflows for investment are in tech,” said Ian Rostowsky, co-head of the hi-tech and venture capital practice at law firm Amit, Pollak, Matalon & Co. “Israel has a mature high tech ecosystem, more than most other countries, but when we talk about independence, it is clear that the high-tech ecosystem is not independent in the sense that it can be standalone and survive without foreign investment.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“One of the main worries is that the international perception of Israel is very negative as the war interrupts everything,” warned the South African-born Rostowsky. “Although Israel has done relatively well despite the negative headwinds, they are significant and are becoming more and more difficult if the situation continues and leads to a larger outflow of companies relocating outside of Israel, some of it happening at the demand of investors.”\nIn a year during which Israel faced one of the longest and most intense wars in its history and levels of geopolitical uncertainty have been off the charts, the tech industry racked up $13.4 billion in merger and acquisition deals in 2024, up from $7.5 billion in 2023 though a far cry from the $82 billion high recorded in 2021.\nUS chipmaker Nvidia spent almost $1 billion to buy two Israeli startups: Israeli AI startup Deci for about $300 million and local startup Run:ai, for about $700 million. Run:ai is Nvidia’s biggest acquisition in Israel since it bought Mellanox Technologies Ltd. in 2020 for $6.9 billion.\nAdv. Ian Rostowsky co-head of the hi-tech and venture capital practice at law firm Amit, Pollak, Matalon & Co. (Courtesy)\nSan Francisco-based software giant Salesforce also scored two big deals in Israel with the acquisition of Own, an Israeli data backup startup, for $1.9 billion and local data management startup Zoomin for $450 million. Other notable mega deals that closed this year are Blackstone acquiring Priority Software for $800 million and Johnson & Johnson buying V-Wave.\nOn top of that, this year saw the biggest buyout in the country’s history as Google’s parent company, Alphabet, agreed to snap up Israeli-founded cybersecurity unicorn Wiz in an all-cash deal for a staggering $32 billion. The mega deal is estimated to generate $4 billion in taxes, which will flow into national coffers.\nIn the shadow of the war, Israeli tech companies raised $10.6 billion in fresh capital in 2024, according to data by Startup Nation Central. In the first quarter of 2025, private funding generated $3.2 billion for investment into local tech companies.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“What comes to mind when I think of Independence Day and what Israeli tech has achieved in 77 years is a sense of great pride,” said Yonatan Sela, an Israel-based partner at Australian venture capital fund Square Peg. “The Wiz deal is just the icing on the cake but it doesn’t come in a vacuum.”\n“It comes out of an ecosystem that is thriving with a lot of foundation: a VC ecosystem built over the years that supports companies from the early stages, great innovation, and one big breathing organism with many parts that supports and fuels each other, inspires each other, finances each other, and hires each other,” Sela said.\nSquare Peg, with $3.3 billion in assets under management, has been active in Israel for more than a decade and has since invested $400 million in local startups and tech companies, including Deci (bought by Nvidia), Exodigo, and Qodo.\n“The war hurt the Israel brand. Especially during the first year, until we made military achievements as a country, there were a lot of headwinds,” said Sela. “Since the beeper operation and everything that followed, we see regained recognition of Israeli technology, intelligence, and other capabilities luring foreign investors, especially American funds, which entered the local market during the past year more aggressively than before.”\n“Investors understand that as a tech hub, Israel is among the world’s top three hubs, and that hasn’t changed — what offsets it a bit is that for some investment bodies, and especially European investment funds and some Asian investment funds, it’s been more challenging to get Israeli investments approved because Israel is at war,” he said.\nYonatan Sela, partner at Australian venture capital fund Square Peg. (Courtesy)\nIn Israel’s tech ecosystem, startups are the lifeblood of future mergers and acquisitions, tax income, and employment creation. Tech employees pay more than a third of all tax income collected, which underpins the vital importance of the sector as a key driver for the recovery of an economy that has been stumbling through the repercussions of 19 months of war.\nThe economy’s dependence on the tech sector has significantly grown in the past decade, driven by rapid growth in tax revenues from the sector, led by an increase in the number of employees and rising salaries.\nThe tech industry last year contributed 20% to local GDP, versus 6.2% in 1995. It also made up more than 50% of total exports. Tech employees account for about 11.4% of the workforce.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBoth Sela and Rostowsky cautioned that the still impressive fundraising and M&A figures achieved during this difficult war period are marred by a number of worrying trends and challenges that have only increased during the past few months as attempts to revive the protested judicial overhaul resurfaced.\n“Over the years, many Israeli entrepreneurs and founders have succeeded in growing valuable companies and are becoming more skillful in managing large companies to sell them, but many like Wiz are registered in Delaware and not in Israel, which is unfortunate because they are paying taxes elsewhere,” said Rostowsky. “In Israel, for every success, there are a lot of companies that didn’t manage to raise enough financing, and have reduced their operations significantly, were closed down, or were sold for relatively small amounts during the challenging war period.”\nHe added, “Some multinational companies have scaled back or even closed their Israeli operations because of the war and amid growing internal political instability.”\nSela cautioned that starting with the proposed judicial overhaul in January 2023, local companies “felt insecure and started to move their incorporation outside of Israel, and that has intensified by the war.”\n“Would it be better if companies were incorporated in Israel and felt safe to do it here? Yes, but I don’t think that will be the case in the next few years,” Sela said. “The biggest question in that regard is where the talent is going to want to live and whether this country will be a place where Israeli entrepreneurs like the Wiz founders will want to do business.”\nLeft: Founders of US-Israeli cyber unicorn Wiz (from left to right): VP Product Yinon Costica, CEO Assaf Rappaport, CTO Ami Luttwak, and VP R&D Roy Reznik.

(JHVEPhoto/iStock)\nFrom the beginning of the war until July 2024, the number of tech employees who departed Israel for long-term relocation increased and stood at about 8,300 people, or about 2.1% of the local tech workforce.\n“If this trend is going to continue — whether it’s for economic incentives, imbalance in the burden of serving in the military, or the feeling that the justice system is going to turn to be something less predictable — then we are going to see more and more people not come back from either relocations or academic studies abroad and slowly but surely this drip of talent will grow,” said Sela.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRostowsky urged the government to play a significant role in seeing that the ecosystem remains attractive by offering tax incentives or additional grants for Israeli companies.\n“It’s up to us as a country and for the government to ensure that in the long term, the talent continues to feel very welcome in Israel,” said Sela. “At the end of the day, that’s what’s going to define the strength of the Israeli tech ecosystem and whether companies will remain and work here.”"}

(Haim Azulay/Flash 90)\nDuring Independence Day week, there is a threefold increase in the amount of meat and other products bought for grilling compared to a regular week. The average Israeli consumes 19.6 kg of beef per year, about 50% more than in 2015, according to the latest data by the Agriculture Ministry.\nLengy attributed continued price increases to a combination of local and global factors.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The Hamas war led to a decline in demand by war-hit consumers for [more expensive] steaks, but created a ‘contagion effect’ that pushed up the prices of cheaper cuts, such as ground beef, which soared by tens of percent,” said Lengy. “Importers who had accumulated surplus entrecote compensated for the losses by raising the prices of other cuts.”\nIn addition, high concentration in the local meat market, controlled by a small number of importers and slaughterhouses, limits competition, according to Lengy.\n“Due to a shortage of skilled butchers, retail chains switch to the sale of pre-packaged meat, which in turn leads consumers to buy [fresh meat] at more expensive butcher shops,” said Lengy.\nGlobally, “production and input costs, including animal food, such as soybeans and grain prices, which account for about 65% of the cost of raising chickens, have soared in the past year due to trade disruptions, including the trade war between the US and China and the war in Ukraine,” said Lengy.\nUltra Finance analyst Roy Lengy. (Courtesy)\nIsrael is a country without wide open spaces of grazing land for cattle, and a growing population, which increases the country’s reliance on meat imports. Between 70% and 80% of the meat consumed in Israel is derived from imports, and 20% to 30% from local production. Fresh meat from imported calves makes up about a third of the beef consumed in Israel. Imported frozen meat accounts for more than 40%, imported chilled meat 17%, and meat from Israeli-grown calves about 14%.\nEarlier this year, the government introduced rises in taxes, prices and utility bills. The new year also ushered in a slew of reforms aimed at lowering prices by aligning Israeli and European standards to ease trade barriers for imports and foster competition.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe food sector reform includes expanding the adoption of European regulation in areas such as food safety and labeling, to reduce bureaucracy and bring savings to the importer of 7% to 11%.\n“The reform, which came into effect in 2025, helps to cut time and costs of meat imports,” said Lengy. “However, the reform did not lead to a significant price drop [for consumers], partly due to global price increases and the high concentration in the local market.”"}

In May last year, the Islamic country, which has been one of the harshest critics of Israel during Gaza war, cut off all trade with Israel — a dramatic move for Israel’s fifth-largest source of imported goods.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The decision by the Turkish airlines to relinquish their slots at Ben Gurion Airport could signal a major shift in Israel-Turkey relations — or at least a downturn in aviation coordination between the two countries,” said Waxman. “This move raises questions about the Turkish airlines’ underlying motives, whether political or economic.”\nTurkish Airlines and Pegasus Airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nSince the war broke out with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, most foreign airlines have repeatedly canceled and resumed their flights to and from Israel. Hopes for a sustained ceasefire-hostage release deal and a seemingly gradual reduction in tensions earlier this year prompted many major foreign airlines, including UK carrier British Airways, Irish budget carrier Ryanair, and US carriers Delta and United Airlines, to resume part of their flight services to and from Israel in recent weeks, albeit with limited capacity and frequency.\nVirgin Atlantic founder Richard Branson touches down at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel with CEO Shai Weiss in 2019.

(Mordechai Gordon/Foreign Ministry)\nResponding to his letter, the Bank of Israel, however, quickly clarified that it had no plans to remove the 200-shekel note from circulation nor cancel any series of notes, in an apparent bid to reassure Israelis holding such notes.\n“The governor has not yet been presented with a sufficiently well-founded professional justification for canceling any banknote,” the bank said in a statement to The Times of Israel.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The proposals put forward on the subject by various parties do not meet any professional standard, their feasibility for implementation does not exist, and they were not presented in an orderly manner to the governor and were not coordinated in any way with the Bank of Israel,” the statement added.\n“We emphasize that the NIS 200 banknote in circulation, like the other banknotes and coins, continues and will continue to be used as usual,” said the bank.\nFollowing the bank’s rejection, Sa’ar said its refusal to consider his renewed proposal was “regrettable.”\n“After the Bank of Israel rejected a previous proposal to completely cancel the use of 200-shekel banknotes,” said Sa’ar, “the bank decided to reject a new and reasoned proposal to cancel the series of 200-shekel banknotes that was introduced into the Gaza Strip. This was done within a few minutes, without discussion and without any real explanation.”\nHe asserted that the bank is obligated to immediately examine any proposal relevant to the country’s security.\nThis is the second time in recent months that the government has proposed getting rid of the NIS 200 note, Israel’s largest denomination.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAn earlier proposal to cancel the NIS 200 note in order to combat “black money,” money laundering and tax evasion was put forward in September 2024, and also dismissed by the Bank of Israel.\nAt the time the bank said that there was no “professional justification” for such a plan and that the governor does “not intend to use his authority to work toward canceling any banknote or to change the mix of banknotes in circulation.”"}

But despite the extra competition to flagship carrier El Al, it will likely be some time before consumers can reasonably hope for airfare prices to begin to sink back toward prewar levels.\nThough El Al is no longer the only option for those looking to fly nonstop between Israel and North America, prices have remained higher than normal. Recent months have seen a second Israeli carrier — Arkia — enter the field, along with two US carriers. But capacity and demand are still limited by war and many Israeli travelers are willing to pay a premium to avoid booking with airlines liable to cancel trips should rocket sirens start blaring again. This keeps El Al from needing to bring down prices to more competitive levels.\nOn Monday, Israir announced that it would become the third Israeli carrier to offer flights to New York, saying it had been granted a two-year temporary carrier permit by the US Department of Transportation, with final approval to launch the route expected by June. The airline said that it hopes to start plying the route by Passover 2026, with as many as six weekly nonstop roundtrip flights between Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport and New York.\n00:00 / 00:00\n“In the short-term, Israir’s announcement will have zero effect on ticket prices, but in the long-term the carrier could prove to be a competitor for El Al on the route next year,” Ziontours Jerusalem CEO Mark Feldman told The Times of Israel. “However, prices will not drop dramatically until we see an influx of incoming tourists filling up airplanes of foreign and local airlines, but for now, we are in the middle of a war, and they are not returning.”\nOphir Tours chief marketing officer Neta Gafni was hopeful that Israir’s launch of flights to the US would further increase seat availability on the Tel Aviv-New York route, “which in turn means that other carriers operating the service will eventually need to bring down prices to compete and fill up the seats of their planes.”\nSign up for the Tech Israel Daily\nand never miss Israel's top tech stories\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nFor now, round-trip fares on the Tel Aviv-New York route are expected to continue to be priced around $1,200 to $1,800 for the coming months and may climb to around $2,000 or higher during the peak summer travel season.\nPassengers arrive at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv on April 9, 2025. (Avshalom Sassoni/Flash90)\nThat’s a steep discount from last year, when the mass departure of all foreign carriers amid the war in Gaza gave El Al a monopoly on the route and prices climbed as high as $7,000, with economy seats hard to come by.\nBut it’s still significantly higher than the sub-$1000 round-trip tickets that could be had before war broke out 18 months ago.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMark Feldman, CEO of Ziontours. (Courtesy)\nThe entry of additional Israeli airlines and partial return of US airlines will probably not be enough to bring airfares on direct flights to New York back down to those levels, according to travel experts who spoke to The Times of Israel.\nThe plans for the debut of Israir’s long-haul flight service to New York come after Israel’s Arkia launched nonstop service between Tel Aviv and New York in early February, betting that Israelis would be eager to fly abroad during the peak spring and summer travel seasons. The Israeli carrier originally planned to operate the route for a period of only three months, but recently extended the service until October.\nHopes for a sustained ceasefire-hostage release deal and a seemingly gradual reduction in tensions earlier this year also prompted some major foreign airlines, including US carriers Delta and United Airlines, to resume part of their flight services to and from Israel in recent weeks, albeit with limited capacity and frequency. United Airlines restarted its flights to Israel on March 15, and Delta Air Lines relaunched its Tel Aviv-New York route on April 1.\nFeldman noted that round-trip ticket prices to New York in May for flights operated by US carriers are selling for around $1,500, while El Al’s price tag is $1,800. Round-trip airfares from Tel Aviv to New York with Arkia sell for as low as around $999, including luggage, seating and two meals, but only for a limited special promotion period during May and June. From July, Arkia’s round-trip fare on the route is around $1,800, similar to El Al’s ticket prices.\nBut going for the cheaper fares on foreign airlines — or finding a bargain by stopping in Europe — comes with the added worry that flights could be canceled due to the security situation and passengers could be stranded.\nAn Arkia flight over Tel Aviv, December 14, 2024. (Yossi Aloni FLASH90)\n“That’s a nice, substantial difference for people who are flying with United to Newark, taking the risk, hoping that United will not pull out again, and saving a few hundred dollars against El Al,” said Feldman. “Consumers may still get mad about why El Al ticket prices are still high, but at least we can now offer them alternatives with United or Delta, which we could not a year ago.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nArkia, meanwhile, lacks the ability to fully compete with El Al on a level playing field, he added.\n“Arkia attracts a different clientele, they have found a niche with marketing to the ultra-Orthodox population, but they are not the businesspeople who will prefer to fly with airlines such as El Al as it is reliable and offers connections within North America,” said Feldman.\nOphir Tours chief marketing officer Neta Gafni. (Courtesy/Dan Peretz)\nFeldman said that consumers who bought their tickets in January and February paid a more expensive airfare than people buying their tickets in April for the summer. Gafni called current prices “reasonable.”\n“Israelis can buy summer ticket prices for what they were paying in February and March — they were paying around $2,500 in February to fly, and now they can fly under that in the summer,” said Feldman.\nBoth said that most of their customers still prefer to book with El Al because of the built-up trust among travelers that the flagship carrier is a safe bet as it continued to fly during the war when foreign carriers stopped flying.\n“We are seeing that competition hasn’t much affected El Al since their planes are full as there are still enough people willing to pay a premium to fly with El Al,” said Feldman. “People have been flying El Al for every reason in the last 18 months: it is a reliable, safe, and stable airline, and they know they are going to fly and get home when foreign carriers stop their services if the security situation deteriorates.”\n“That’s why we haven’t seen El AL lower its prices to compete with Arkia, and that’s why United or Delta can come back and grab market space, which is what they have done with slightly cheaper prices,” Feldman added. “This will certainly continue for the spring and for the summer, unless the situation in Gaza is resolved and the security situation changes.”"}

Citron served a total of 200 days in Gaza as a combat paramedic in the IDF’s 401st Armored Brigade.\nAt the peak of his first round of reserve duty in December 2023, Citron briefly exited at the Zikim crossing to escort a military troop convoy on its way into the Strip. While waiting at the crossing for some 40 minutes, Citron was asked by his unit to speak to an “American” man who had flown in from New York to deliver supplies to soldiers. The unit was hoping to raise funds towards purchasing better equipment, a common practice in the early chaotic days of the war when the IDF’s supply chain was not at peak efficiency.\nThat “American” was Brazilian-born Alan Buch — Citron’s distant friend of almost a decade. The brief exit from Gaza was, for Citron, a seasoned venture capitalist, a “wild and unexpected chance” encounter. The meeting ultimately led to a new $35 million fund for investments into very young startups established under extraordinary circumstances while its founder was on reserve duty in Gaza.\n“Since the outbreak of war, it has been a back and forth between being a soldier, a venture capitalist, a father, and a husband,” the 34-year-old Citron told The Times of Israel.\nSign up for the Tech Israel Daily\nand never miss Israel's top tech stories\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“When you’re deep in combat in Gaza, you completely forget what normal life looks like — everything revolves around the mission,” said the Israeli-born Citron, who lives in the central city of Ra’anana with his wife and three children. “That random surprise encounter with Alan at a time when you are removed from your ‘normal life’ was a pretty crazy and unforgettable story.”\nReserve combat paramedic David Citron (far left) during a military operation inside the Gaza Strip. (Courtesy)\nCitron first met Buch in New York in 2016 in a random social interaction. Buch, who studied in Sao Paolo and Austria before building a career in global wealth and alternative investment management, had been living in Brooklyn in recent years.\n“After October 7, I couldn’t just sit in Brooklyn doing nothing,” said Buch, who also lived in Israel for two years in his early teens. “I got on a plane to Israel and traveled across the country to find ways I could help.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“I raised donations, delivered gear to soldiers, and one day, at the Zikim crossing, I suddenly saw David,” he said.\nDuring the chance reunion, Buch told his friend that he wanted to increase his involvement in Israel. Then Citron reentered Gaza.\n“We started hanging out together more when Alan was traveling back and forth from New York to Israel, and I was in between reserve duty rounds,” said Citron. “We began talking about how we could join forces as Alan wanted to do more in Israel, not just from a philanthropic perspective but also from a business perspective.”\n“We wanted to combine both fashions, investing in tech companies and investing in Israel,” Citron added.\nCitron built up his investment career at Israeli VC fund OurCrowd and Flint Capital, a Boston-based VC firm that has invested in Israeli technology for more than a decade. He also launched Sheva, a VC fund he co-founded with former Israeli NBA player Omri Casspi, which he still manages. His notable investments include Eon, Upwind, PointFive, Flow Security (acquired by Crowdstrike), CyberX (acquired by Microsoft), and Cyolo.\n“Since we’re both investors, we decided to channel our energy into a new fund focused on supporting Israeli innovation,” said Buch.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe two started to develop the idea of raising a tech fund in July last year, but Citron shared that the biggest challenge for advancing their new venture were the long stretches of reserve duty in Gaza.\nAlan Buch (left) and David Citron, co-founders of venture capital fund, TBD VC, in New York. (Courtesy)\n“Going back and forth between reserve duty and your normal life is incredibly disruptive, and it gets exponentially more difficult to recover after each discharge,” said Citron. “It is exhausting, mentally and physically.”\nAfter being released from reserve duty in the middle of this past December, Citron and his partner started fundraising, and within three months they managed to raise the $35 million fund.\nOfficially launched on Monday, TBD VC, short for “To Be Determined Venture Capital,” captures the spirit of early-stage investing in Israeli startups and ventures that are still forming, and that need investors to support and influence their journey, said Citron. The fund also plans to participate in seed fundraising rounds of startups founded by Israeli entrepreneurs.\nTBD hopes to funnel about $1 million apiece into 20 young startups focused on cybersecurity, enterprise software, and infrastructure. The fund is backed by a mix of institutional investors from Israel and the United States, family offices, and Israeli cyber entrepreneurs.\n“We are looking for startups where the mindset of the entrepreneurs is scrappy but efficient, able to communicate even in the most intense situation,” said Citron. “It ties back to my mindset and how it’s evolved since the war, what it means to be in a war zone, and the people you have got in the battlefield.”\nCitron said one of the fund’s targets is to “focus on making the tech world more accessible to combat veterans.”\n“As a paramedic during the war, I chatted with thousands of soldiers, many of the best warriors I have ever met, and sadly, most weren’t connected to tech,” said Citron. “When you ask them about what they will do after being discharged, they find it challenging to get their footing from a career perspective.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraeli reserve soldiers take part in a military drill in the Golan Heights, northern Israel, January 24, 2024. (Ayal Margolin/Flash90)\n“We’re now working on creative ways to help,” said Citron.\nThe venture capitalist said that one of the initiatives is to donate a portion of the fund’s profits to Gav Lalohem, a nonprofit organization that helps released soldiers build skills for careers in tech and other professional sectors.\n“If you’re a fellow [reserve soldier] who is trying to find your footing, please reach out to me,” Citron wrote on his LinkedIn profile. “The least I will do is buy you a cup of coffee and leverage my network.”"}

After all individuals reach a balanced equilibrium, the network converges towards a small world structure with six degrees of separation. (The authors/Physical Review X)\nIn contrast, Fire said, regular users are most often connected via a small number of groups.\nBy creating an algorithm to predict the links between two users, he can find fraud and other irregularities. From this concept of connections in social networks, he said, “We move to networks in biology.”\nTracking down suspicious behavior of proteins\nProteins have been dubbed the workhorses of biochemistry. Known as nature’s versatile tool, these essential molecules in the body interact with one another in complex networks, called protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks.\nScientists can understand how proteins function and how they contribute to health and disease with an analysis of their networks.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis is where Yeger-Lotem’s work comes in.\nIn her lab, she develops and applies novel computational approaches in network biology, studying how proteins, genes, and other molecules communicate, and treating them as if they belong to a large social network inside the human body.\nThe same algorithms that uncover irregularities in social networks can be applied to atypical behavior in the networks of proteins.\nThe analysis of the interaction patterns among proteins, Yeger-Lotem said, can uncover which proteins play special roles, both positively and negatively, in tissues such as the brain and heart.\n“Proteins don’t act alone,” Yeger-Lotem told The Times of Israel by telephone. “Basically, like any molecule, they act by interacting with other molecules. So we look at protein interactions and ask why they seem different in one tissue than in another.”\nThe WGAND algorithm can help researchers identify which genes and processes are important in different tissues and why certain diseases happen, she said.\nIllustrative. Malware, ransomware attack by a hacker.

She encourages scientists to “send us an email and say that they used it and found something interesting.”\nThe two researchers are already working on their next project, Yeger-Lotem said.\n“It’s not always easy, but it’s a fun collaboration,” she said."}

As a result, cells from a single placenta can treat more than 20,000 patients.\n“In the end of that process, we have a vial that contains a specific amount of our placental expanded cells depending on the dosage needed for the patient,” said Bar Zvi. “Once the vial with the cells is injected into the muscle, it stimulates the human body’s own capabilities for the reactivation and regeneration of blood cells, mitigates the effects of radiation exposure and we see the recovery happening.”\nPluri chief commercial officer Nimrod Bar Zvi. (Courtesy)\nPluri says that its cell-based treatment stimulates and regenerates the production of all three types of blood cells produced in the blood marrow: white and red blood cells as well as platelets.\nUnder the terms of the collaboration agreement with Hemafund and subject to receiving external government and private sector funding, the veteran biotech firm will produce and supply an initial capacity of 12,000 doses of its PLX-R18, sufficient to treat 6,000 people. The doses will be stored and managed by Hemafund and delivered to medical institutions across Ukraine in case of need.\n“At present, there are no other treatments for radiation poisoning that use stem cells taken from a placenta as far as we know,” said Bar Zvi. “The ability to treat acute radiation exposure with cell therapy and to scale it up for mass production is where we are unique since we can supply thousands and thousands of vials to large numbers of people.”\nPluri is publicly traded on the Nasdaq as well as the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. At the Matam Advanced Technology Park in Haifa, the biotech firm operates a cell therapy production facility, which it says has been designed to handle large-scale manufacturing of cellular therapies. It could also be mobilized for mass production to respond to global emergencies if nuclear threats escalate. The firm employs a total of 130 people.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPluri and Hemafund said they will also seek to advance clinical trials to register the PLX-R18 therapy as a radiation countermeasure and obtain necessary regulatory approvals from Ukraine’s health ministry. The collaboration is expected to potentially generate over $100 million in value for both parties.\n“Our cryostorage facilities and logistics network position us well to support the introduction of PLX-R18 as a potential vital tool for radiation emergency preparedness in Ukraine,” said Hemafund founder Yaroslav Issakov. “While we hope such treatments remain precautionary, our goal is to stand ready to distribute this potential therapy in the event of an emergency.”\nPluri uses patented technology to create cell-based pharmaceutical and food products. (Courtesy)\nPluri said that its PLX-R18 has been safely tested in both humans and animals. Results from a series of recent studies in animals of its stem cell therapy after radiation exposure demonstrated an increase in survival rates from 29% in the placebo group to 97% in the treated group.\nThe administration of PLX- R18 as a prophylactic measure 24 hours before radiation exposure, and again 72 hours after exposure, resulted in an increase in survival rates, from 4% in the placebo group to 74% in the treated group.\nThe FDA previously cleared an Investigational New Drug application for PLX-R18 for the treatment of radiation sickness and granted it Orphan Drug Designation. This means that should a nuclear event take place, Pluri could use the drug to treat victims.\nPluri’s bioreactors for the cultivation of cell-based therapy products. (Courtesy/Michael Brikman)\nIn July 2023, Pluri was awarded a three-year $4.2 million contract by the US National Institutes of Health to continue to develop its novel treatment for deadly radiation sickness and to collaborate with the US Department of Defense’s Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute in Maryland.\nAs part of the contract, the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) will fund final studies required to complete the biotech firm’s application for FDA approval to market its PLX-R18 therapy.\nPluri hopes that the approval would make it eligible for purchase by the US Strategic National Stockpile — the country’s repository of critical medical supplies — as a medical countermeasure for exposure to nuclear radiation."}

(GIL COHEN-MAGEN / AFP)\nWhile such vehicles and other systems are currently operated by humans, future versions could be autonomous, raising ethical and legal concerns over the unchartered future of warfare being shaped by the Israeli military in the Gaza war.\n‘Changing the paradigm’\nIsrael’s increasing use of advanced technology on the battlefield, from air defense systems to a broad range of AI-driven intelligence tools, has been well-documented but also criticized for inaccuracies, lack of human oversight and potential violations of international law.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnalysts say the growing Israeli deployment of the Robdozer reflects broader global trends toward automation in heavy combat vehicles, like remote-controlled personnel carriers that operate much like drones.\nAn Israeli unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV or drone) flies over Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on January 3, 2024, during the ongoing conflict between Israel and the terror group Hamas. (AFP)\nAn Israeli military official, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, told AFP that the army has been using “robotic tools for over a decade, but in very small numbers. Now it is being used in large-scale warfare.”\nTroops can now operate machinery without having to enter enemy territory, said the official.\nAndrew Fox, a retired British army major and a research fellow at the London-based Henry Jackson Society, said the Israeli military was likely the first force to use remote-controlled combat machinery in an active war zone.\n“It’s a really big development” that is “changing the paradigm” of warfare, carrying out tasks as effectively but at a far reduced risk to personnel, he said.\nA new era of war\n“This is the future,” said John Spencer, chair of urban warfare studies at the US military’s Modern War Institute at West Point.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMany “have been experimenting with it, but nobody has seen direct deployment into active modern combat,” he added. “It is very unique.”\nBut beyond ethical and legal drawbacks to such advanced technology, there is also the need for an overriding human presence to make decisions particularly in unusual situations.\nThe October 7, 2023, attack — when some Hamas terrorists breached the high-security border to invade southern Israel, where it killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages, starting the Gaza war — was a disastrous example for that, said Tal Mimran of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\nGazans celebrate by a destroyed Israeli tank at the broken Israel-Gaza border fence, east of Khan Younis, October 7, 2023.

Those products, many of which are developed in China or other countries subject to heavy tariffs, will likely become more expensive, increasing infrastructure costs and making the Israeli products more costly.\nThe companies also use products like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. If those companies increase their costs due to the tariffs, those expenses will also affect Israeli firms’ bottom line, said Franklin, who has been based in New York for 13 years.\nThe economic uncertainty wrought by the tariffs impacts the companies by shaking investor confidence. The Israeli financial tech company eToro, for example, delayed its planned initial public offering in the US earlier this month due to market volatility.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“You see a real impact on companies and their plans to go and raise money. One example is eToro, which postponed its planned IPO due to the market conditions and uncertainty,” Franklin said.\n“For the publicly traded tech companies, they’re currently strapped into the public markets rollercoaster,” Kaplowitz said. The startup community will be hit hardest if investors have fewer funds, or less appetite for high-risk, early-stage investing, he added.\nAmir Zilberstein, an Israeli investor in New York with the Team8 venture capital firm, said some companies had slowed down operations while they wait to see how the tariffs play out. He estimated that 70% of Israel’s high-tech exports are software and services. In fields like cybersecurity, ” I cannot see any direct effect. There’s hardly any hardware involved,” he said.\nHe cautioned that it was too early to tell what the end results will be.\n“It’s a complex plan and it’s going to take time to implement, and even when they’re going to finish implementing, it is going to take time to see the consequences,” Zilberstein said.\nThere is also a grey area regarding what constitutes an Israeli company in the US. Some firms are based in Israel but have offices in the US, and others are headquartered in the US but conduct research and development in Israel, for example. Israelis living in the US also found businesses, such as restaurants, that are not directly tied to Israel or the tech industry. Each company, depending on its structure, will be affected by the tariffs in a different way.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe tariffs could also present opportunities for Israeli tech companies. Investors might prefer deploying capital for longer-term investments, especially in software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies that have more limited exposure to the tariffs and market dynamics, Kaplowitz said. The tariffs will also distance the US from China as a trading partner, creating an opening that Israeli companies could fill with exports, he said.\nZilberstein said that the differing tariff rates could present advantages if Israel has a lower tariff rate than other countries, but “it’s hard to predict anything,” he said. Negotiations could further lower Israel’s tariff rate, for example, but the Trump administration could also remove the exclusions for software. The eventual policies could end up being minor, or momentous, he said.\n“If there are going to be significant changes and the market will believe that they’re here to stay, then we will for sure see shifts,” he said.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, left, speaks alongside US President Donald Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on April 7, 2025. (Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images via AFP)\nThe Trump administration’s visa policies are also not a major factor for the companies. Usually, Israeli founders move to the US on an L-1 visa, then hire American employees, while uncertainty has largely revolved around H-1B visas. Many founders have also moved to New York since the start of the war because the lack of flights made it difficult and expensive to travel back and forth between the two countries, Franklin said.\nLast week, the Israel Innovation Authority said that in the first nine months of Israel’s war with the Hamas terror group, 8,300 tech employees left the country and relocated for a year or more, or about 2.1 percent of the local high-tech workforce. The report also said the number of workers in Israel’s tech workforce declined last year for the first time in at least a decade, sparking fears of brain drain and lost tax revenue in Israel’s crucial tech sector. The report did not specify which countries the workers moved to.\n“The brain-drain issue, which has long impacted Israeli tech, could pose a major threat to the start-up ecosystem in Israel,” Kaplowitz said. “It could lead to more US-based jobs, although it’s important to note that studies have shown that trade creates more jobs than foreign direct investment.”\nIsrael had hoped to avoid US President Donald Trump’s sweeping decree to impose levies on global imports announced this month. Instead, it was hit with a 17% tariff despite lifting all remaining duties on US imports in a last-minute attempt to be spared.\nThere are more than 400 Israeli startups in New York City, according to Israeli Mapped in NY. Some of the leading fields include cybersecurity, financial tech and business software. New York is home to around 30 Israel-founded unicorns, or businesses worth at least $1 billion, second in the US to California, with 35 unicorns, according to the US-Israel Business Alliance."}

The Khan Station (named for the adjacent theater) will allow travel to Tel Aviv in about 38 minutes, and to Ben Gurion Airport in about 23 minutes, the municipality said. Currently, there is only one train station in Jerusalem, the Yitzhak Navon station at the western entrance of the city.\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThere will also be two light rail stations for the Blue Line, a route under construction that will connect the Ramot neighborhood in northern Jerusalem to Gilo in the southern part of the city. Work on that line, which is expected to open around 2030, began earlier this year.\nAn artist’s rendition of the new First Station District plan for Jerusalem (Eden – Jerusalem Economic Development Company)\nA cable car station will also provide transportation to the Old City, taking riders over the Ben Hinnom Valley and Mount Zion, the municipality said. The controversial project was first proposed more than a decade ago, but has been opposed by numerous parties who argued that it is untenably obtrusive and politically irresponsible.\nAuthorities hope the 1.4-kilometer (nearly a mile) cable car will ferry up to 3,000 people per hour in up to 72 10-person cabins. It has been opposed by the Franciscan order that acts as custodian of Catholic sites in the Holy Land, among other religious groups.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe existing First Station entertainment complex and Park Hamesila path will remain open to the public during the ongoing work, and construction will be phased to minimize disruptions, the municipality said. Preliminary work has already begun, including preparing the Khan complex for the light rail. Signs will soon be erected along the Park Hamesila path, guiding visitors through the construction areas.\nThe current First Station complex, opened in 2013, is built on the location of the old Jerusalem railway station, which was constructed in 1892 to connect the city to Jaffa. The new project will be managed by the Jerusalem municipality through Eden, its economic development company.\nRebuilding Jerusalem\nThe announcement of the First Station complex project comes as Jerusalem prepares to approve a NIS 9.72 billion ($2.63 billion) budget for 2025, eight percent higher than the previous year. Combined with a development budget of NIS 6.2 billion approved last December, that would give the city a total budget of some NIS 16 billion for continued investment in education, welfare, culture, transportation, employment and operations, the municipality said.\nThe city also recently recommended for approval a number of significant construction projects in Talpiot and the city’s western entrance.\nAn artist’s rendition of the new project planned at the site of the Achim Yisrael mall in Talpiot (SYL Studio Yigal Levi Architects)\nThe master plan for the industrial area of Talpiot calls for the building of approximately 2 million square meters (21.5 million square feet) of new development, including 10,000 housing units and hundreds of thousands of square meters of office, commercial and public space.\nThe city’s local planning and building committee called this week for the approval of four projects: two 30-story residential towers between HaTaasia, HaHaroshet, and HaOman streets; two 31-story mixed-use residential towers near Pierre Koenig, HaOman, and HaTaasia streets, currently occupied by a gas station and vehicle service facilities; replacing the one-story Beit Bakal site on Yad Harutzim Street with a new 10-story mixed-use building; and demolishing the four-story Ahim Yisrael Mall on Yad Harutzim Street in favor of two 24-story residential towers.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMeanwhile, at the City Gateway project at the entrance to the city, the local planning and building committee recommended the approval of a plan to destroy the old post office building at 217 Jaffa Street to build a complex with two 40-story towers, one of which will house various government ministries and offices.\nAn artist’s rendition of the new tower planned at the entrance to Jerusalem (Zarrhy Architects)\nJerusalem has been aggressively pursuing construction plans that will change the face of the city, with a modernization plan that threatens to add significant congestion for residents.

Most of the Haredim here work, and some have gone to the army. Everyone is happy to live together and get along.”\nBut now, residents of Neve Shamir, otherwise known as Ramat Beit Shemesh Hei, or E — denoting it as the fifth neighborhood of Ramat Beit Shemesh, after A, B, C, and D — are up in arms over plans to turn what was originally going to be a mixed neighborhood into one marketed exclusively to the ultra-Orthodox.\nThe issue came to the fore in March, after Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf bragged to attendees at an education conference in Beit Shemesh that he had used back channels to claim the neighborhood for their sector.\n“What they thought would be for the general public, we found a way to allocate to the Haredi public instead,” Goldknopf was caught on camera saying. “We can’t talk about all the details publicly.”\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nHowever, the change in the status of the neighborhood has been public for almost a year.\nYitzhak Goldknopf (center) in the Knesset on November 11, 2024. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nA new housing project, set to include 3,438 new apartments, is being marketed under the Housing Ministry’s Mehhir LeMatara (target price) program, in which the state arranges with contractors to sell a certain number of housing units at discounted prices.\nThe tender for the project, which also includes office and commercial space, was first announced in December 2023, just two months after Hamas launched its war against Israel on October 7, 2023.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, when the tender was actually offered in May 2024, an extra line of text was added to the project description: “It has elements that are appropriate for an ultra-Orthodox population.”\n“That was unexpected,” Daniel said.\nNew neighborhoods\nLocated in the southeast part of Beit Shemesh, Neve Shamir feels like an active construction site, with rows of apartment buildings in various stages of completion. Just over a thousand families currently live in the neighborhood, out of some 2,000 planned units, said Moshe Shitrit, a member of the Beit Shemesh municipality.\nAs the neighborhood is still in its infancy, community infrastructure is extremely limited. “It’s only apartment buildings. There are almost no stores here yet, and very few official synagogues,” said Daniel, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect his privacy. “We need to drive out to one of the nearby neighborhoods to do our grocery shopping.”\nA street in Neve Shamir lined with housing and construction sites, April 8, 2025 (Zev Stub/Times of Israel)\nDaniel’s garden is on the edge of a cliff, overlooking other neighborhoods down the road. “After we bought our apartment, we noticed that an open area at the bottom of the cliff was being prepared for building, even though that wasn’t in the official municipal plans. We asked about it, and people refused to give us a straight answer. We found out years later that they want to build 12-story buildings here. This is going to add a lot of congestion to a neighborhood where there isn’t enough infrastructure to begin with.”\nAccording to Daniel, the plan calls for 809 apartments to be built in a row parallel to an existing apartment block of similar size that includes only 210 units. That means it will be full of small, densely packed homes designed for low-income Haredi families.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBeit Shemesh municipal councilman Moshe Shitrit (Courtesy)\n“The issue at stake is quality of life,” said Shitrit, whose party in the municipality opposes the plan. “You can see in the planning sketches that they want to make the neighborhood more crowded, and add more synagogues while having less infrastructure for culture and sports. The people who bought homes here expected a different type of community.”\n“I wouldn’t classify this as a dispute between Haredi and secular communities,” Shitrit said. “Many of the people objecting to the plans are Haredi themselves, but they don’t want to live in an exclusively Haredi neighborhood, which is what this is turning into.”\nTurf wars\nWith a population of some 150,000, Beit Shemesh and its different neighborhoods are no strangers to social conflict. Originally populated by new immigrants from Arab countries in the 1950s, the city was “discovered” in the 1990s by English-speaking immigrants who saw the city as a low-cost suburb located near the country’s two largest cities, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.\nHaredi groups also started buying homes in Beit Shemesh in the 1990s, and comprised as much as 40 percent of the population by 2011. As the ultra-Orthodox grew in numbers and power, those from national religious or secular communities, which have lower birthrates, were increasingly edged out of neighborhoods. Incidents of forced segregation and religious coercion became increasingly common as “turf wars” took shape around Haredi groups carving out spaces for their religiously stringent lifestyles.\nToday, 70% of Beit Shemesh is Haredi, Shitrit said, with a sprawling landscape of enclaves for different communities of varying religious bents or backgrounds.  Broadly speaking, the neighborhoods of Ramat Beit Shemesh A and C are popular with educated Haredi English-speaking immigrants, while Ramat Beit Shemesh B is associated with sects of more extreme ideologies.\n“About 10 years ago, as the city continued to expand, Likud made an agreement with the Haredi parties to divide the city,” Shitrit said. “It was decided that Ramat Beit Shemesh D would be Haredi, and Ramat Beit Shemesh E would be for the general population.”\nBecause part of Ramat Beit Shemesh E was ready before Ramat Beit Shemesh D, many Haredi families also chose to purchase homes there, but were generally respectful of the diversity of views in the predominantly national-religious community.\n“There were a handful of extremist families in the community from the beginning, but overall, the community got along really well together,” Daniel said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA street in Neve Shamir lined with homes, April 8, 2025 (Zev Stub/Times of Israel)\nThe trouble started when planning for the second phase of Ramat Beit Shemesh E began, Shitrit said. “All of a sudden, the Haredim started grabbing it for themselves, saying there was never any agreement. That’s what is happening now with the new tender.”\nThe Housing Ministry, meanwhile, tells a different version of the story, claiming that facts have changed on the ground.\n“It’s very simple. The municipality approached the Housing Ministry and said that while it may have planned for a mixed neighborhood a decade ago, today that no longer reflects the reality,” a spokesperson for the ministry said. “Virtually the entire population is Haredi, and there is no point now in bringing a mixed community there. Not only that, but we have commitments to the contractors who are building there to ensure that the project is marketed successfully, and defining this as a Haredi community from the beginning will help ensure that it is a success.”\nReaching an understanding soon will be crucial to manage similar scuffles that will inevitably arise over the coming years.\nBeit Shemesh has been one of Israel’s fastest-growing cities over the past two decades, and an aggressive new master plan for the city looks to more than triple the population to 500,000 in the coming decades. That means that what happens next in this saga will likely set a precedent for future construction plans.\nNationwide trends\nThe expansion of Haredi communities to new areas isn’t exclusive to the Beit Shemesh area. It’s a nationwide phenomenon attributable largely to demographic and economic factors, explained Hebrew University’s Itschak Trachtengot, who specializes in economic policies for Haredi communities.\nDr. Itschak Trachtengot (Hebrew University)\n“Traditionally, Haredim have always preferred to congregate in their own areas, first in Jerusalem and Bnei Brak, and then, starting in the 1980s and 1990s, in satellite cities like Modiin Illit, Elad, Beitar Illit and Beit Shemesh,” Trachtengot said. “But over the years, as their numbers grew and the cost of housing got higher, they started to move into mixed and secular cities and neighborhoods. You can see this in places like Safed, Tiberias, Afula, Kiryat Gat, Kiryat Malachi, Ashdod — many of which are now 25% Haredi or more.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis is a pattern that is likely to continue to replicate itself, Trachtengot said. A number of discounted Mehir LeMatara projects around the country have been prioritized for the Haredi sector, including communities in Karmei Gat West, Rechasim, and Elad, according to the Hebrew news site Mida.\n“It is important to understand that because of the way their community structures are organized, once a certain number of Haredim move into a certain place, many more will come as well,” Trachtengot explained. “Therefore, due to the growth of the community, which now comprises almost 14% of the residents of the State of Israel, it is reasonable to expect that 20 more cities will become Haredi within the next 10 years.”\nWhile government and city officials may not be able to stop this trend, it is important for them to acknowledge this reality and plan for it, Trachtengot said.\n“How can you prepare for something like this in advance? The first thing is to find the parts of the Haredi population that are interested in living together with other communities and empower them to create an environment of integration instead of a narrative of isolation,” Trachtengot said. “After that, you have to create employment options that are appropriate for their unique needs.”\nThese are realities taking place around the country, Trachtengot noted. “If you don’t plan for it, you are going to continue to see the types of conflict you see in Beit Shemesh and elsewhere.”"}

It’s a luxury mall designed in the style of great European piazzas, sitting in the desert just several kilometers from the ramshackle Khan al-Ahmar Bedouin encampment.\nIt bills itself as a home design center, but entertainment is one of its main markets. And it is helping to drive economic growth for the local municipality, even if its stores are mostly empty.\nWhen The Times of Israel visited D-City on a warm day in February, there was an eerie quiet reminiscent of COVID-era lockdowns. In a mall with 120 stores and 60,000 square meters (646,000 square feet) of commercial space, there weren’t more than several dozen shoppers circulating the complex at a time, according to this reporter’s estimate, and many of the large designer showrooms were empty or closed. Construction being done near the front entrance added to the impression that the shopping center was barely open.\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“It’s very nice here, but I think they need to figure out how to use the potential better,” said Shmuel, another shopper from Jerusalem.\nIsrael’s war against Hamas in Gaza isn’t helping matters, with many Israelis now more reluctant to travel beyond the Green Line due to security factors. Traffic at the mall from Jewish and Arab shoppers, already low before Hamas launched its attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, has since declined about 20%, store owners estimate.\nA view inside the D-City mall, nearly empty of shoppers, on February 26, 2025 (Zev Stub/Times of Israel)\nFor those who invested over NIS 1 billion in a mall that opened less than four years ago with the hopes of becoming one of the country’s most active shopping centers, the quiet is disappointing. But store owners and the building’s management say there is more happening beneath the surface than meets the eye.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“People who are focused on buying furniture know to come here,” said Aviad, who runs two stores in the mall selling mattresses and custom closets. “We opened a year ago, and we get designers and contractors building large apartment complexes all over the country who know that they get a better shopping experience here. I get a lot of sales by phone or online, and people hear about us through word of mouth. Our business only needs to make a few sales a day, and this place attracts the right people.”\nDespite the lack of crowds, many store managers seemed busy during our visit, handling sales calls and managing orders by phone and online. Most we spoke with said they remain committed to the mall, even if foot traffic remains low.\n“We firmly believe in this complex and its future,” said Evgeni Haitovich, vice president of sales at Israeli bedding store Aeroflex, which has 24 showrooms around the country. “People come here because they know they can find everything they need for their homes in one place. Every Israeli company in the home design business should be here.”\nThe interior of D-City, February 26, 2025 (Zev Stub/Times of Israel)\nA different kind of shopping center\nD-City operates by a different set of rules than most shopping centers, said Hanoch Kass, the baby-faced Orthodox Jewish owner whose investment company owns the center.\n“This is a center focused on interior design, and that’s totally different than most malls, where the goal is to have lots of people coming in and buying clothes,” said Kass, whose Kass Group also operates real estate projects in Georgia. “Here, you have architects coming in occasionally to get to know the distributors, and then placing orders by phone of tens of thousands of shekels at a time.”\nTotal revenue for D-City stores in 2024 was a combined NIS 180 million, a respectable figure, but less than in the previous year due to the war, Kass said. A significant upgrade is underway that will add new stores to the mall, including many from outside the home sector, he noted.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnd the shopping mall is just one part of the equation for a massive 200,000-square-meter (2.2 million-square-foot) complex, Kass said. That includes a 150-room hotel (with 100 more rooms under construction), a massive event hall, an amusement park and several entertainment centers, a workspace, a gym, and a spa.\n“Our event hall is full almost every night. We have a wedding for almost 7,000 people tonight,” Kass said in an interview. The massive hall, designed to replicate the famous Venice Hotel in Las Vegas, was originally intended as a food court, “but that doesn’t make sense when the mall doesn’t attract large crowds,” he noted.\nD-City’s event hall, formerly the food court (Courtesy/D-City)\nNonetheless, Kass said, the D-Jump entertainment center located inside the mall is full almost every day, and the nearby Magic Kass amusement park had a million visitors last year. The hotel hosts mainly tour groups, conferences, and army and police functions, but will include the country’s largest spa when construction is completed later this year, he added.\n“Each part of this is working well, and there will be a lot more people coming when we complete our upgrade in September,” Kass said.\nUnmet expectations\nNot everyone in the mall is willing to wait that long. Many stores in the mall have shuttered, with the pace of closures increasing in recent months, shop owners said.\n“When this place first opened, there were people, and sales were coming in,” said Etti, whose Tzemer carpet store was having a liquidation sale in February before the branch was closed. “But after the coronavirus pandemic and the war, there is almost no one here, despite the fact that so much money was invested in it. One store after another has closed, and now we have no choice but to close as well.”\nA store in D-City advertises a clearance sale ahead of its branch closure, February 26, 2025 (Zev Stub/Times of Israel)\nThe mall’s desolation belies the excitement stirring in its halls when it opened in August 2021 to great fanfare. Tens of thousands visited the mall each day during the grand opening, which featured concerts by well-known Israeli singers, street performers, laser light shows, and even a line of cabaret girls dancing in front of the giant fountain at the mall’s entrance.\nWhile many questioned the logic of opening a mall in the desert during the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, others were optimistic that it would replace Jerusalem’s industrial neighborhood of Talpiot as the capital’s center for home products. It seemed logical that D-City’s large modern showrooms and bountiful parking would entice shoppers away from Talpiot and its old, decrepit buildings and limited parking options.\nADVERTISEMENT\nKass predicted at the time that D-City would soon become one of the busiest malls in the country.\nEvgeni Haitovich (Zev Stub/Times of Israel)\nHowever, concerns about safety, a reputation for high prices, and the mall’s physical location outside of the capital have hindered that vision from becoming a reality. The mall now has 40% fewer stores than when it launched, and traffic remains low even as activity in Talpiot remains consistent.\n“We have an Aeroflex branch in Talpiot and a branch here, along with others around the country,” said Haitovich. “Sales are stronger in Talpiot, but one isn’t replacing the other.”\nOne thing that is clear, nonetheless, is that D-City is helping to breathe new life into surrounding businesses.\nWhen it opened in 2021, the surrounding Mishor Adumim industrial zone was rebranded as Park Israel and has since become one of the most active industrial parks in the country, according to a spokesperson for the adjoining Ma’ale Adumim municipality.\n“Commerce in the industrial zone began to develop in 2014 when Rami Levy opened a grocery store branch here, and it has continued to grow steadily since then,” the spokesperson said. “The opening of D-City was a significant and powerful milestone that led to the need for us to change the name.”\nPark Israel is now home to hundreds of stores on an area of about 1,800 dunams (445 acres) of built-up commercial space, the spokesperson said. The industrial park employs about 7,500 people, including about 5,000 Palestinians.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLocals believe that D-City will prove too big to fail and that things will continue to improve at the mall, despite the low traffic.\n“They invested a lot in this place,” said Chen, manager of an electronics store located in the mall since 2022. “Good things take time to develop, and sometimes you need to have patience. There’s no reason it can’t work.”"}

Of those abducted, 14 are still being held in Gaza, just five of them believed alive.\n00:00 / 23:33\nNir Oz is the last of 13 communities to agree on a rehabilitation plan with the Tekuma Directorate and the Finance Ministry. Among other things, the plan includes building community infrastructure and a new neighborhood, named “Chalutz” or “Pioneer,” for the first group of residents who return.\nTekuma Director Aviad Friedman, in the job for just three weeks, told a media briefing Wednesday: “We will add whatever is needed to complete the building.

It was passed on March 25.\nHe added that without criticizing those who visited before him, it was not enough to meet with the kibbutz once a week, and that several temporary directors had preceded him.\n“I believe the right thing is to work intensively until the thing is finished,” he said, adding that since starting the job, he had spent more time with Nir Oz than with his wife.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“We all had to sit together for all those hours and get through obstacles to get to the agreement,” he said.\nTekuma Directorate director Aviad Friedman. (Miri Shimonovich, GPO)\nReaching the agreement had required creativity, he went on. KKL-JNF Jewish National Fund had agreed to give money and donations to Nir Oz would be put into the pot too.\nBefore the October 7 onslaught, there were 229 housing units on Nir Oz.\nRebuilding will be done in three stages, starting with 23 units for the “Pioneer” neighborhood. Friedman said it was too early to tell how many buildings would need demolishing, as each house had to be examined first. He promised an answer by Independence Day on May 1, when he hopes a cornerstone will be laid at the kibbutz.\nBut he said he already envisages a second stage, which would take the total number of housing units to 400.\nHe could not say how the budget broke down, explaining that funding calls would determine some elements and that some things had not yet been signed.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe home of the Bibas family in Kibbutz Nir Oz, photographed in January 2025.

After that, detailed work would begin.\nRevealing that he and his wife Hanna were personal friends of the Dekel-Chen family, whose son Sagui was released from Hamas captivity in February, he said that one Friday last month, he and his wife visited Nir Oz and were taken on a three to four hour tour by an 87-year-old kibbutz member in his golf cart.\nA weekly protest calling for the release of Israelis held hostage by the Hamas terror group in Gaza is held in Kiryat Gat, in a neighborhood hosting many evacuated residents of Kibbutz Nir Oz, devastated by last year’s October 7 Hamas attack, October 5, 2024.

They are so courageous, wanting to go back after what they went through.”\nBut the community’s rehabilitation would not be complete until the remaining live hostages and the bodies of hostages were returned home, he said.\nEarlier on Wednesday, a joint statement from Tekuma, the Finance Ministry and MK Ze’ev Elkin, the minister in charge of rehabilitating the southern and northern borders, said the Tekuma Directorate would make an advance payment for the early planning of the new neighborhood, to allow construction to begin as soon as possible.\nThe kibbutz community is currently living in the southern city of Kiryat Gat."}

Such developments allow apartment owners to upgrade their homes at no cost, while the developer funds the project in exchange for the right to build additional housing units for sale.\nWhile these types of urban renewal projects benefit the parties involved and allow the municipality to add new housing units in existing neighborhoods, they often come at the expense of neighborhood residents, who suffer from noise, increased congestion, and greater competition for community resources. As many as 500 skyscrapers planned for the city in the coming years threaten to irreversibly alter the city’s character.\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nLike most neighborhoods, Rasco, located between the Katamon, Givat Mordechai and Pat neighborhoods in central Jerusalem, has a master plan that sets guidelines for urban renewal construction projects, including how many new housing units can be built, how tall buildings can be, and what traffic changes are needed to accommodate additional housing.\nA master plan for the city published in 2000 also defines a vision for the city’s future development.\nHowever, unlike Jerusalem’s Master Plan 62, created in 1959, these master plans are considered by the municipality to be policy statements, not legally binding documents.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“In practice, the municipality and district committees don’t care about the master plan at all,” said Dorit Perry, the neighborhood resident who spearheaded the legal campaign. “They build whatever they want.”\n68 Tchernichovsky Street (Dorit Perry)\nIn most urban renewal construction cases, the municipality receives plans from an investor who has already obtained the agreement of a majority of tenants for the project. But in the case of a plot of land spanning the properties on 68 Tchernichovsky Street and 39 Shimoni Street, the city developed its own plan for urban renewal, which it would have later pitched to investors.\nFirst approved by Jerusalem’s local planning and building committee in October 2020, the plan seeks to knock down a pair of long 4-story housing buildings and replace them with four new buildings, including one 23-story tower and three 10-story buildings. This would nearly triple the number of housing units on the plot from 108 to 298, and add about a thousand people to the neighborhood.\nOne of the proposal’s benefits was that access to the project’s underground parking lot would be from Herzog Street, a large thoroughfare, instead of from Shimoni, a small one-way side street that already suffers from congestion. The plan would have also made the roads on Tchernichovsky and Shimoni wider and added a center for storefronts and public services, including a daycare center.\nA large yard with a garden sits between the buildings on 68 Tchernichovsky Street and 39 Shimoni Street. (Dorit Perry)\nBut there were problems. Firstly, Perry said, the neighborhood master plan only allows buildings of up to eight stories on those streets, due to the neighborhood’s classification as a “historic” area. (More specifically, six floors for a single building and eight stories for a complex with multiple buildings.)\n“We’re not talking about a small deviation,” Perry said. “A building of 23 stories is three times what the master plan allows.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn addition, Perry said, an independent consultant found that the municipality’s plan to divert traffic off Shimoni had “a very low chance of working.” More likely, she said, it would make congestion within the neighborhood much worse.\n“This project would have destroyed the entire neighborhood,” Perry said.\nNeighbors were up in arms over the proposal and led by Perry, 400 objections were filed against the plan.\n“You have to understand that Dorit Perry led this all herself,” said a community council member familiar with the case. “She took the municipality to court and brought hundreds of people to file documents. She got a hundred people to physically come to court with her and raised thousands of shekels from neighbors to hire a lawyer. Winning a case like this requires someone who is extremely driven, and she made it happen.”\n39 Shimoni Street. (Dorit Perry)\nA petition against the plan was initially rejected, and the plan was approved again by the district planning and building committee in August 2024. After the committee rejected a request to appeal the decision, Perry and her partners took the case to the district court, where they argued that the proposal did not comply with the neighborhood’s master plan.\nAn alternative plan, with shorter buildings and more small apartments appropriate for renters and young couples, was also presented.\nIn a hearing last week, Jerusalem District Court Judge Ilan Sela ruled that the city’s plan was invalid, and called on city engineers to design a new proposal that would comply with the master plan. The municipality said in a statement that it accepted the decision and would develop a new plan based on the court’s ruling.\n“This is a unique case of the court ruling against the municipality that has never happened before,” the community council member said. “No neighborhood has ever won a case against a building project because it deviated from the master plan. It sets a precedent that will require investors to be more careful with future projects.”"}

Renters have no shortage of stories about the challenges of finding a decent apartment or of landlords asking for odd or unreasonable contract terms or failing to provide basic home maintenance.\nWith 29 percent of Israelis renting, a figure that is expected to rise in the coming years, the Construction and Housing Ministry tasked Director General Yehuda Morgenstern with formulating a strategic plan to make the long-term rental market work better. The plan was expected at the end of 2024, but the job has proven more complex than expected, and two months later, there is still no target date for its publication, a Housing Ministry spokesperson said.\nWhenever it is delivered, the plan is unlikely to include any of the ambitious legislative changes or far-reaching targets that have been features of various housing reforms announced over the years.\nInstead, the ministry hopes to make order in some key areas of the long-term rental market and recalibrate the industry’s trajectory for the future. Here’s a look at some of the things likely to appear in the strategic plan.\nInstitutional rentals\nWhen talking about long-term housing solutions, you have to differentiate between two types of markets — institutional government rentals and the private market, noted Camila Meyer Weissberg, a Hebrew University Ph.D. student who is writing her dissertation on Israel’s long-term rental housing policy.\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe vast majority of Israeli tenants rent their homes privately from individuals who own them. This is different from what occurs in most Western countries, where apartment complexes are often designed exclusively for renters and managed by companies that offer standardized contracts and transparent rules about price increases.\nIn 2013, Finance Minister Yair Lapid, new to the Knesset after his Yesh Atid party’s stunning election performance, put forward a plan to create long-term rental complexes where residential units would be rented for five to 10 years at a time. The plan envisioned the development of as many as 150,000 units where renters would pay below-market prices for homes.\nHowever, the reality that emerged has been different. Only about 18,000 units have actually been built to date, serving less than 1% of the rental market. The problem is that the model isn’t worthwhile economically for developers.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“These projects take a lot of capital to develop, they deliver poor annual returns, and you have to wait 20 years or more before you can sell it,” Meyer Weissberg explained. “It’s not a worthwhile investment for contractors or the banks.”\nCamila Meyer Weissberg. (Courtesy)\nPart of the challenge is the low cost of renting in Israel in relation to the purchase value of a property compared to other countries. While income from a rental complex in Europe or the US typically delivers annual returns of 6-7% on the initial investment, this type of project in Israel might return only about 2%. It also means that even if such a project could be viable when interest rates were nearly zero several years ago, it doesn’t work in an era of high interest rates.\nAnother issue is that the program was conceived as a solution to the cost-of-living crisis dominating Israel’s public debate at the time, Meyer Weissberg explained,\n“The idea was to offer housing at 20% or so below market value to the middle class, which was struggling with rising home prices.” Meyer Weissberg said. “By creating a new supply of discounted housing options, there was hope it could help reduce prices throughout the entire market.”\nBecause so few projects were developed, however, that plan failed to materialize, and only a small number of households chosen by lottery to live in these projects benefit from the program, she noted.\nDespite the challenges, the Construction and Housing Ministry is committed to finding ways to make the system work, including bringing into the market large investment funds that can afford to wait decades to see their returns on investment.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Even though these housing projects are moving slower than planned, there is a general understanding that we don’t have a choice,” Meyer Weissberg said. “As more people move to renting and prices continue to rise, even policy-makers and municipalities that were skeptical 10 years ago are now interested. The need is clear, and the government wants to make it work.”\nIsraelis protest against soaring housing prices in Tel Aviv and the cost of living, on July 2, 2022. (Tomer Neuberg/Flash90)\nPrivate renters\nThe vast majority of renters in Israel have one-year contracts with a private landlord, often an individual who bought the property as an investment or for future use. For many, problems can start there.\nOne of the spurs of Israel’s massive price-of-living protests in 2011 was when then-25-year-old video editor Daphne Leef was evicted from her apartment for building renovations. When the renovations were complete, the landlord told her she couldn’t move back in because his son wanted to live there. When she couldn’t find affordable housing, she took to the streets.\nThat type of short-term planning by owners is typical in Israel, said Nachi Paris, a Jerusalem-based real estate agent.\n“Unlike in the US, it is very rare to see a landlord here offer a rental contract for three to five years,” Paris said. “Because selling can be so lucrative, even long-term owners don’t want to lock themselves into long-term commitments where they will be unable to sell at a high price. So contracts are typically one to two years maximum.”\nThe Construction and Housing Ministry is said to be formulating a plan to encourage owners to offer longer-term contracts, likely with tax incentives. However, it is not yet clear how it will do so.\n“Tax incentives are not always successful, and it is not clear what types of incentives would work in this case,” said Oriya Shohat, a Jerusalem-based attorney specializing in real estate law. “Often, attempts to try to intervene in the real estate market end up making things worse. The best tool the government has to influence the real estate market is to tweak the supply and demand.”\nOriya Shohat (Courtesy)\nMeanwhile, Israel’s laws regulating the rental market are among the most lax in the Western world, with minimal laws regulating pricing or other terms in a rental contract.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“In many countries, a rental agreement is required to have certain terms, and needs notarized in order to be recognized,” said Meyer Weissberg. “Here, you can put almost anything you want in the contract.”\nThe 2017 Fair Rental Law sought to establish a baseline to define minimal requirements for livable apartments and fair terms in a rental contract. However, the experiences of many renters attest to the fact that these standards are not always followed.\nWhile many cities in Israel offer rental contract templates to landlords, the plan is expected to recommend improvements.\nCollecting more accurate data about the rental market is another target of the ministry’s plan. Rental information published by the Central Bureau of Statistics is generally seen as inaccurate, as many landlords do not or are not required to report their earnings. Many now look to sites like Madlan or WeCheck for real-time market information. The ministry requires a plan to gather higher-quality information to guide renters and its own policy-making.\nAware of the challenges, the Construction and Housing Ministry hopes to deliver a realistic and nuanced framework to straighten out the rental market in the near future.\n“People want stability and long-term living security, regardless of whether they rent from a company or an individual,” Morgenstern told a real estate industry conference last month. “We just have to identify what works.”"}

This feels more secure for them and is probably the most low-risk for investors in the Dubai market,” added Doodman, who said the most popular areas he recommends are Jumeirah Village Circle (also known as JVC), Dubai Marina, Downtown Dubai and Business Bay.\nWhile most buyers are taking one- or two-bedroom apartments, which range between NIS 1-2 million ($279,000-$258,000), rental returns are between NIS 110,000-120,000 ($30,000-$33,000) annually, before deducting for costs such as monthly building service fees. “We can rent these out very quickly with a great yield,” said Doodman.\nDubai-based Idan Doodman works with Israeli investors in the UAE and in Israel who want to take advantage of the economic opportunities presented by the Abraham Accords.

If I have a big investor, I would suggest investing in the Jumeirah coastline, but they’re very different numbers.”\nThere are natural concerns, Ashur said, in the midst of the war and in the wake of the kidnapping and murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogen last November, a Chabad rabbi whose death shook the community. But as a millionaires’ playground, the UAE remains a safe place to invest, Ashur said.\n“The UAE is a safe haven for everybody,” said Ashur. “If they will exclude one group of people, others will start to have shaky thoughts about the UAE. Millionaires from all over the world are coming here.”\nLast May, Henley & Partners, which tracks private wealth and investment migration, said Dubai contains the Middle East’s highest concentration of resident millionaires with 72,500, ranking it as the 21st wealthiest city in the world.\nA floating restaurant is seen decked up as it is is anchored at Dubai Marina Walk in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, August 13, 2024.

There is always a group of people who could think maybe we will be next. It can create a domino effect.

However, the central bank said, the trend has intensified in recent months, posing increased risk for buyers and developers and possibly even the banking system.\nSuch arrangements are now used in 50 percent of all new housing purchases, compared to 20% before the war, the Bank of Israel said in February. These types of loans are risky because they encourage buyers to make purchases they might be unable to complete, it explained.\nFor deferred payment plans, in which more than 25% of the sales price is not due until the delivery of the home at the end of construction, the banks financing the developers must show increased readiness for the possibility that the sale might fall through. Lenders will now be required to have capital available of 150% of the credit granted, a move that will make it more expensive for builders to obtain such financing and less attractive to offer it to purchasers.\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nBalloon loans are loans given by the contractor to the customer to be repaid with interest in a lump sum when the apartment is finally delivered.

In order to minimize the increased risk of default on these loans, The Bank of Israel now requires that such loans may not make up more than 10% of all the home loans granted by a bank each month, in order to stem their use.\nThe new guidelines also include additional measures to reduce risk for all parties, the central bank said.\nThe moves are a further blow to people looking to enter the housing market amid already sky-high prices, existing lending restrictions and high interest rates.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRecent figures showed that housing costs were 7.7% more on average in December-January compared to the same period in 2023-2024, soon after the start of the war."}

Now, that same apartment costs between NIS 12,000 and 13,000 [$3,364 and $3,645].”\nYou can find apartments listed in the NIS 8,000 ($2,243) range online, “but those are usually a top-floor walk-up, or it isn’t renovated or doesn’t have parking,” Kowalsky added. “If you are looking for the whole package, with a balcony and an elevator, it’s at least NIS 12,000 [$3,364], and it will get rented as soon as it goes on the market.”\nEric Opland, real estate director at L. Levy Nadlan, agrees. “Demand is huge now,” he said. “When an apartment is available, it goes very quickly. If you are looking for a place, you have to start early.”\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nMuch of the reason for the surge is an increase in immigration from American and French Jews in response to rising antisemitism, agents said. During the first 10 months of 2024, immigration from the United States rose 12% to 2,786 new arrivals, while immigration from France rose a whopping 79% to 1,846 people, according to Jewish Agency figures.\nEric Opland, real estate director at L Levy Nadlan (Courtesy)\nJudith Ben Avi, who runs a real estate agency specializing in Jerusalem rentals, said many of the new arrivals prefer to rent a place in Jerusalem for a few years before they commit to buying. “The problem is that they’ll pay anything, and that drives up prices for everyone,” she said.\nKowalsky had a somewhat different take on it. Many of the older immigrants moving to Jerusalem had already bought properties in the city as investments and rented them out. When they arrive, their tenants are forced to move, making fewer properties available.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnother significant contributor is the popularity of urban renewal projects in which apartment buildings are renovated or rebuilt at no cost to the owner, by allowing the contractor to build extra apartments to sell as an investment.\nYitzchak Kowalsky, CEO of YKK Jerusalem Real Estate (Courtesy)\n“A lot of Jerusalem residents have evacuated their homes while they are rebuilt under a Tama 38 or Pinui Binui plan,” Kowalsky said, referring to two such programs. “For each project, you get a large number of families that are looking to rent another place in their neighborhood for a few years until construction is completed. The market doesn’t have enough supply to allow for that. And the fact that a lot of construction is being delayed due to the shortage of workers available since October 7 makes it even worse.”\nThe hottest markets are the central historical neighborhoods like Talbieh and Rehavia, along with nearby Mamilla, Opland said. Immigrants with a bit less money to spend go to Givat Mordechai or Har Homa, Ben Avi added.\nDue to the country’s ongoing security situation, most renters insist on selecting apartments with a safe room to protect them in the case of rocket attacks, Opland noted. “That’s the most important thing, even more than an open Sukkah balcony is for religious Jews,” he said.\nThe challenge for students\nThe upturn in rental prices can be tough on university students and young adults moving to the city. Jerusalem is a top destination for students who come to learn at Hebrew University, Israel’s top-rated university, as well as other institutions such as Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School, and Hadassah College of Technology.\nJudith Ben Avi, owner of JBA Real Estate (Courtesy)\n“Most of them are sharing apartments,” Ben Avi said. “You see three people splitting an old apartment near Azza Street for NIS 9,000 [$2,523], sharing the bills. Their prices have gone up too, although they receive big discounts on property taxes.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe most desirable neighborhood in Jerusalem for students is the center, with nearly 40% of its students making it their home while they study, according to the Madlan real estate website.\nOpland noted that with rental prices rising so quickly, owners have become more flexible about the length of rental contracts. “People used to insist on a commitment of a year or longer from the tenant,” he said. “But now they are open to shorter contracts since they know they’ll be able to rent their apartment out for even more after the tenant leaves.”"}

As foreign and local buyers assess their options and confront new tax realities, the question is how sharp the rise will be.\nChaim Friedman, co-founder and managing director of First Israel Group, a boutique mortgage brokerage based in Jerusalem, expects home prices to spike as much as 10-15% this year around the country.\n“There’s a lot of demand that hasn’t been realized in previous years due to the fact that a lot of people put their lives on hold during the war,” he said. “Demand is going to return in the north and the south, where the markets have been pretty much frozen, and people are going to return to the market to buy homes to live in or as an investment. I think it’s going to be a very strong year.”\nNot everyone agrees. Nachi Paris, owner of Nachi Realty in Jerusalem, expects high demand to continue, but thinks prices will rise more moderately.\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“I expect prices in Jerusalem to go up twice as much as inflation,” Paris said. “That is to say, if inflation rises 3% for the year, prices will rise 6%. That means it is still a good investment, but prices aren’t rising so fast that if you don’t buy now, you’ll miss the boat. You missed the boat because you didn’t buy in 2016, but that’s behind us now.”\nWith economic data for December 2024 not yet available, the Central Bureau of Statistics says housing prices in Israel have risen by 7.8% over the previous 12 months, continuing a growth trend that has continued for most of the past two decades.\nChaim Friedman, co-founder and managing director of First Israel Group (Courtesy)\nA combination of factors — including a longstanding housing shortage, strong population growth, and growing foreign investment — has kept demand high, even as the conflict disrupts construction and economic stability.\nADVERTISEMENT\nInflation for the 12 months through November was 3.4%, and is expected to average 2.6% for 2025 after rising faster during the first quarter of the year, the Bank of Israel said earlier this month.\nGeopolitical factors including the Gaza ceasefire, the government’s approval of the national budget, the routing of Hezbollah and the ceasefire in the north have reduced the country’s risk premium looking forward, Bank of Israel governor Amir Yaron said.\nA project under construction in Jerusalem’s Kiryat Menachem neighborhood (LSA Lazarovich Studio of Architects)\nRising costs of building\nThe cost of building new homes has skyrocketed since October 7, 2023, after Israel barred the West Bank Palestinians who have traditionally comprised most of the construction labor force.\nWork on many sites has stopped or slowed as contractors have been unable to replace lost laborers with those from other countries.\nNahum Langental, head of the HuMantra Group and a former MK.(Courtesy)\n“Israel has brought in workers from China or India, as well as Arab Israelis, but there aren’t enough, and the government hasn’t fulfilled its promises to bring in more,” said Nahum Langental, head of the HuMantra Group and a former Knesset member. “In any case, they are much more expensive to employ. A Palestinian Arab costs a company about NIS 20,000 [$5,581] per month to employ, while an Arab Israeli costs NIS 25,000 [$6,976], and a Chinese worker costs NIS 30,000 [$8,372] per month.”\nBuilding materials such as cement, stones, and sand are also more expensive after rising for several years, Langental said.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The global market will be focused on supplying these materials to Gaza, Syria, and Lebanon, which will make them even more expensive here,” he predicted. “The cost of these materials has already increased by 6%, and it could rise another 6%.”\nThat means newer apartments will cost much more than secondhand ones, making them less attractive to buyers. The number of unsold new apartments in Israel reached a record high of more than 70,000 units in November, according to CBS.\n“The price of construction has gone through the roof,” Friedman said. “The cost of mid to high-end construction had doubled to as much as NIS 25,000 per square meter [$652 per square foot]. That’s just going to fuel future price increases.”\nHot markets\nWhile CBS data shows a majority of apartments being sold in the country’s central district, the hottest markets for high-end sales are in Jerusalem and Netanya, Friedman said.\n“The area around Tel Aviv has been rather weak, relatively speaking,” Friedman said. “People don’t want to buy an expensive home in places where missile sirens are relatively common. Jerusalem and Netanya are slightly out of the range of most rockets, and people there are less worried about the short-term risks related to the war.”\nFriedman called Netanya “the nicest city that is affordable near the coast,” and noted that more US buyers are choosing to live there instead of just investing in properties. Apartments in Netanya are half the price of those in Tel Aviv per square foot, and 30-40% less than in Herzliya, he added.\nThe Jerusalem municipality is engaged in an ambitious growth plan that will increase the city’s population by 300,000 in the next 15 years, Paris noted. The city already has aggressive plans to build nearly 500 new skyscrapers above 18 stories, compared to just 30 today, and upgrade its urban infrastructure to handle all of it.\nThat and virtually insatiable demand from foreign buyers will ensure that prices in the capital keep rising, Paris said.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“It’s going to be crazy,” he said. “I see a lot of demand for pre-sales on new projects, and there is a never-ending infusion of money from America. Everyone in the US who can afford it wants to buy an apartment in Jerusalem.”\nNachi Paris, owner of Nachi Realty in Jerusalem (Courtesy)\nParis added another recommendation for investors. “I think Ashkelon is a very good investment, especially for someone who wants to invest in Israel’s postwar rebuilding,” he said. “It is 30% cheaper than Ashdod because of the fear of rockets from Gaza, but it is 20 kilometers [12 miles] down the road and has the same type of population. You can find apartments on the water in good neighborhoods starting at NIS 1.5 million [$418,600].”\nParis discouraged investors from seeking properties in towns in the north or south, saying there isn’t much available and the market is not very strong. Properties in northern cities like Acre or Kiryat Shmona are risky, depending on what happens with Hezbollah in the future, he added.\nLangental, meanwhile, recommended properties in Lod, where his company is currently building 800 units starting at NIS 1.8 million ($502,310) for a three-room apartment.\nIllustrative: Multistory residential buildings in Ashkelon, Israel, May 2022. (rglinsky via iStock by Getty Images)\nTax increases\nHome buyers are going to pay more taxes in 2025 after the government passed several reforms that will help it raise the money to pay for the war.\nVAT was raised from 17% to 18% at the beginning of January, affecting the purchase price of new construction properties and commercial real estate transactions. That means a buyer will now pay NIS 10,000 ($2,790) more in taxes for every million shekels of the purchase price.\nLooking to beat the tax increase, Israelis took a record NIS 13.8 billion ($3.85 billion) in mortgages in December 2024 to get their purchases completed before the deadline. This included a record NIS 3.2 billion ($893 million) taken in balloon loans required by contractors in cases when the buyer put a 10% or 20% down payment for a home under construction.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“A lot of those were taken because, if you are going to need to take that kind of loan anytime soon, it’s best to take it before taxes go up,” Friedman explained.\nThe VAT increase doesn’t directly affect the sale of secondhand homes, although it may influence price levels across the general market. It also affects service fees for lawyers, architects, and other professional services.\nOther reforms will also be costly for some.\nView of luxury towers in Tel Aviv. (Miriam Alster/Flash90)\nHigh-income sellers with annual incomes will pay higher capital gains taxes on property sales. Currently in Israel, a “wealth tax” of 3% is levied on individuals with annual incomes of more than NIS 721,560 ($201,359). Starting in 2025, an additional 2% surtax will also be imposed on capital gains of that amount for people fitting into that category.\nAdditionally, the government has frozen purchase tax brackets for 2025. Normally, these brackets are adjusted every year to reflect inflation rates. By keeping the brackets the same as last year, some buyers will effectively pay higher taxes.\nFriedman noted that a reform passed in August gives new immigrants a huge tax break on their first apartment that may virtually eliminate purchase taxes for acquisitions of up to NIS 6 million ($1.7 million)."}

Since then the family has spent the Passover and Sukkot holidays in their second home, despite the continuing threat of rocket and missile attacks on Israel from Iran-backed groups in Gaza, Lebanon and around the region.\nBuying a property in Israel was always a dream for the Azrans. Both had spent time in Israel on youth programs as teenagers, and when they married, they lived in Israel for a while. The idea was to someday return, said Marc Azran.\nThe push came after the October 7 events, he said, because the couple felt the need to “be connected” and support Israel, he said. Though they continue to live in the US, they now have a home to visit in Israel, and hope to eventually move there.\n“I feel like it’s time for the Jewish people to be in Israel, and I want to be part of that destiny, and I want my children to be part of that destiny,” Azran said over the phone as he drove to his job where he works as an anesthesiologist. “I do not feel that there is a bright future for Jews in America and in Europe, in the long term.”\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nAccording to official figures, the Azrans are just one of hundreds of foreign residents who have snapped up homes in Israel since the start of fighting some 15 months ago. By all appearances, the trend is being driven by Jewish buyers who want to enhance their connection with the Jewish state, and by fears of rising antisemitism around the globe, which outweigh concerns about the threat of war or terrorist violence.\nMarc Azran, left, Yael Azran, second left, and their three children at their second home in Beit Shemesh in October 2024. (Courtesy: Jeff Kalwerisky.)\nAntisemitic incidents have surged around the world since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in which terrorists from the Gaza Strip invaded and killed some 1,200 people, took 251 hostages and triggered the ongoing war there.\nAccording to data published in November by the Finance Ministry, foreign residents in September acquired 254 apartments in Israel, a sharp increase of 119 percent compared to September last year, and the highest level of acquisitions since July 2022, when the market was infused with post-COVID optimism and a lower tax rate.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHome purchases by foreigners dropped steeply in October 2023 in the wake of the attack and war, official figures show, but quickly rebounded, reaching pre-war levels by December. They mostly continued to rise throughout the year before the September surge.\n“After October 7, for one month, there was nothing…. It was dead, nobody was calling,” said Donny Fein, a real estate agent who owns the Elite Israel Realty firm which focuses on the Beit Shemesh area. “It took about three or four weeks, [and then] the phones did not stop ringing.”\nDonny Fein. (Courtesy: Jared Bernstein)\nFein should know, Beit Shemesh and the larger Jerusalem area are ground zero for the resurgent foreign buyer phenomenon, making up over half the properties purchased by foreigners in September. In Beit Shemesh alone, 87 apartments were purchased by non-residents in September, outstripping even the capital despite being less than a fifth of its size.\nA Brooklyn native who immigrated to Israel, Fein said some customers had bought homes in Israel without ever visiting them in person. The buyers aren’t necessarily looking for their dream home, but rather to have a safe haven in their back pocket should trouble strike and they need to flee, he said. Until then, the foreign owners generally rent out their units on short-term leases of two years or less, to keep their options open.\n“They call it the Mashiach clause,” Fein said, making joking reference to the messianic yearning for Israel deeply ingrained in Jewish Orthodox theology. While standard contracts in Israel contain no such clause accounting for the possibility of divine salvation, it’s an idea in the back of many buyers’ minds, according to Fein.\nIllustrative: Students protest on the street after police close the student plaza during an anti-Israel demonstration over the war in Gaza at the George Washington University in Washington, April 26, 2024.

This is what they say.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nForeign home purchases in Israel are nothing new, and even with the surge in September, levels remain far below their 2005 high, when some 1,400 homes were sold to foreigners in a single fiscal quarter. But many in Israel also see the purchases as a scourge, taking properties off a market where demand already exceeds supply and driving prices higher. Foreign acquisitions in luxury complexes are also often kept as vacation homes rather than being rented out, turning whole buildings in prime locations into dimly lit shells for much of the year.\nBuilders working on the Mamilla luxury apartments, situated across from David’s Village, both considered to be part of Jerusalem’s “ghost apartments.” (photo credit: Rebecca Zeffert/Flash 90)\nBut since October 7, experts believe the purchases are being fueled by the same antisemitism fears driving immigration to Israel even as war rages.\nAccording to data published by the Aliyah and Integration Ministry and the Jewish Agency, some 31,000 new immigrants came to Israel from around the world between September 2023 and September 2024. Most of the immigrants were from Russia, North America, France, Ukraine, Belarus and Britain, the figures show.\nThe city that absorbed the most immigrants was Netanya, followed by Tel Aviv, Haifa, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, and Ashdod.\nNew immigrants from France arrive on a special “Aliyah Flight” at Ben Gurion Airport in central Israel on August 1, 2024.

But Netanel Shuchner, the CEO of real estate firm RMA-ET, said his company has seen a sharp rise in demand from foreign residents for homes in Israel, mainly in Tel Aviv and Ra’anana.\nMany of the prospective buyers are from the US and France, and Shuchner predicted even more people would also begin looking for homes in Israel following a wave of anti-Jewish and anti-Israel violence that rocked Amsterdam when the Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team visited for a match.\n“Following the recent events in Amsterdam I expect we will see a further rise in demand,” said Shuchner, who is also a lecturer in economics and real estate valuations at the College of Management Academic Studies.\nNetanel Shuchner.

While rising antisemitism in the US was not a driving factor, he admitted it may have played a role as he and his wife decided on the purchase. “It is not a conscious thing, but it definitely was in the back of our minds.”\nWhatever the pull, it is strong enough to motivate buyers to pay above-market prices in order to have a home in Israel rather than anywhere else, Fein noted. He called it an “emotional premium.”\n“People always said to me it’s not safe in Israel, but I always said at least in Israel we know who your enemies are,” he said. “In America, you could be walking down some random street and some crazy guy who hates Jews can literally just knock you out.”"}

This paradox has raised questions: How can demand for housing remain robust in a country embroiled in such turmoil?\nA combination of factors — including a long-standing housing shortage, strong population growth, and growing foreign investment — has kept demand high, even as the conflict disrupts construction and economic stability. While the market remains hot, it’s creating significant challenges for first-time buyers, who are increasingly priced out of central cities.\nAccording to the most recent Alrov Housing Affordability Index, the second quarter of 2024 saw housing prices reach levels of unaffordability nearly on par with the peak recorded during the second quarter of 2023. The report, which measures housing affordability based on mortgage repayments and down payments required for entry into the market, highlights the growing challenge for many Israelis seeking home ownership.\nDanny Ben-Shahar, co-author of the report and director of the Alrov Institute for Real Estate Research at Tel Aviv University’s Coller School of Management, explained that the sharp rise in prices began long before the war.\n“Looking at the past decade, we see that prices began increasing around 2007, with a brief stabilization before 2020. Over the past two years, however, prices have surged again,” he told The Times of Israel.\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe war — which began in October 2023 after thousands of Hamas terrorists invaded Israel, slaughtering 1,200 people and kidnapping 251 to the Gaza Strip  — would lead one to expect a sharp downturn in the real estate market, yet demand remains unabated.\n“What surprises me is that, despite the ongoing conflict, we continue to see strong demand. People are still investing in Israeli real estate,” Ben-Shahar said. Data from the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics corroborates the claim, revealing that prices have continued to rise by six to seven percent per year.\nDanny Ben-Shahar, director of the Alrov Institute for Real Estate Research at Tel Aviv University’s Coller School of Management. (Courtesy/ Micha Loubaton)\nA complex web of economic forces\nTo understand this anomaly, experts point to a combination of macroeconomic factors that extend beyond the war. Nir Mualam, a professor of architecture and urban planning at Haifa’s Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, noted that even before the conflict, housing prices had risen dramatically due to systemic issues within the Israeli market.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The key problem is a chronic shortage of housing units, which existed long before the war,” he said. “The Israeli planning system simply cannot produce enough housing to meet demand.”\nIsrael’s booming population, among the highest in the developed world, further fuels this demand. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, Israel’s population grew by 1.6% in 2023 alone.\n“With 2.6 million households in Israel, we need an additional 55,000-65,000 homes annually just to keep pace with population growth,” Ben-Shahar said.\nIllustrative: A maternity ward in an Israeli hospital. (Flash90)\nYet, even this demand cannot be met. Mualam points to a growing trend of “housing units on paper” — a system where buyers commit to properties before they are built, providing developers with upfront payments but with no guarantees on delivery timelines. This practice has created a speculative housing market, where prices continue to rise based on expectations rather than completed construction.\nThe war’s impact on the construction sector\nThe war has exacerbated the housing shortage, primarily due to disruptions in the construction sector. Palestinian workers, who make up a significant portion of the workforce in Israeli construction, have largely disappeared from the market since October 2023. This shortage of labor has brought many ongoing projects to a halt. Mualam notes that even before the war, the COVID-19 pandemic had already constrained the ability to produce new housing, as fewer workers from the West Bank and Gaza entered Israel’s major cities.\nMoreover, as the war has intensified, construction companies face additional delays due to the mobilization of business owners and employees for military reserve duty. This has affected the ability to plan and execute new developments.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFor instance, when reached for comment, the head of H.K.R. Construction Group in Kfar Saba responded via text message, explaining that he was currently serving in the reserves in the north and unavailable to discuss the impact on his company. Such disruptions illustrate the far-reaching effects of the conflict on the housing sector.\nRising interest rates and international demand\nAnother factor contributing to the high cost of housing in Israel is the recent surge in interest rates. Ben-Shahar noted that the ongoing war has led to a rise in Israel’s risk premium, which in turn has caused a significant downgrade in the country’s credit rating. As the central bank keeps interest rates high to combat inflation, the cost of homeownership continues to climb.\nYet, unlike in other countries, inflation expectations in Israel remain stubbornly high.\n“Talks of further interest rate hikes are ongoing,” Ben-Shahar said, suggesting that the situation may worsen before it improves.\nInterestingly, while local demand for real estate has softened somewhat due to the war and the economic challenges it has brought, foreign interest in Israeli properties has surged.\nReal estate broker Yuri Wolosov with the Armon Real Estate Agency in Bat Yam reported a noticeable influx of buyers from abroad, particularly from the United States and France.\nA view of the luxury apartment neighborhood of Mamila in Jerusalem, on October 27, 2015. (Lior Mizrahi/Flash90)\n“I’m getting calls from wealthy Jewish clients in New York and Paris looking to purchase properties in Israel, often not for immediate use but as a hedge against rising antisemitism in their home countries,” Wolosov said.\nIndeed, the Anti-Defamation League has documented more than 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the United States since October 7, 2023, a 60% increase from the previous year. “People are scared,” Wolosov added. “The feeling is that something worse is coming.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nDespite these fears, the wealthy clients with whom he works do not hesitate to spend. “They’re buying homes worth 4 or 5 million shekels — about $1.5 million — without a mortgage,” he said. “These are not cheap properties.”\nA crisis for first-time buyers\nFor young, first-time homebuyers, the current market presents an almost insurmountable challenge. Ben-Shahar admitted that the situation is dire, especially for those looking to settle in Israel’s central areas.\n“We are already seeing a large portion of Israeli households unable to afford homes in central cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, forcing them to look toward peripheral areas like Beersheba or Haifa,” he said.\nThe high cost of housing, combined with soaring interest rates, means that many first-time buyers find themselves squeezed out of the market.\n“These rising prices and high interest rates create a situation that is simply untenable for new households trying to enter the market,” said Ben-Shahar.\nAn ultra-Orthodox woman reads a book next to her baby carriage on the beach (Tsafrir Abayov/Flash90)\nA shift in homebuyer priorities\nThe war has also influenced what homebuyers are looking for. Wolosov notes that, among those still purchasing homes, there is a growing demand for new properties with built-in safe rooms, known as a mamad, reflecting heightened security concerns. For some, upgrading existing homes to include reinforced safe rooms has become a priority, especially for those unable to relocate.\nEli Perlowitz, an independent contractor specializing in home renovations in Jerusalem through his company Jerusalem Construction, confirmed the increased demand for safe room upgrades.\n“I’m seeing more requests from clients wanting to fortify their safe rooms. Some even want bomb shelters installed in their backyards,” Perlowitz said. “In this new reality, having a secure space in your home has become the most important housing amenity.”"}

What was happening was that malls became more like service providers in a way, to bring in traffic,” said Oren Paran, managing director of the Retail Innovation Club. “You have kupat holim [HMOS], and you have the dentist and the hairdresser. People are coming more weekly and bi-weekly. This makes more small businesses come into the malls.”\nThe diversity in storefronts inside an Israeli mall is what has kept them booming during extremely dark times.\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“It is not only for shopping but also for social gatherings, for family, to escape the war,” said Ofir Oren, cluster manager of Azrieli Group’s Tel Aviv properties.\nWhile sales and traffic have since recovered, the Azrieli Group offered support for all businesses in the days and months immediately following the October 7 infiltration of southern Israel in which Hamas killed 1,200 and abducted 251 hostages to the Gaza Strip.\nPeople shopping at the Azrieli Mall in Tel Aviv during the municipal elections, February 27, 2024. (Flash90)\nEfforts included rent reductions in October and November, spaces in its malls made available for displaced businesses, and temporary schools in Azrieli-owned buildings for in-need families.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMeanwhile, in the United States, “the mall is dead” is a common phrase uttered by customers and retailers alike. The origin of the modern mall is currently home to around 1,150 centers, according to a May study from Capital One. That number is projected to diminish to as few as 150 malls by 2032. Malls in the US are twice as likely to be vacant when compared to the average retail space, a trend largely blamed on the shift towards e-commerce.\nHowever, reports of the mall’s death may be greatly exaggerated: Retail experts and research show the rise of e-commerce to be grossly overstated, with some indications that shoppers are actually returning to physical stores. In a study released Wednesday from Ryder System, 61 percent of consumers said they prefer in-store shopping for the experience of trying on products, comparing items and beyond, up 21% from last year’s study.\nNew ‘unique lifestyle complexes’ on the way\nDespite a year of war and uncertainty, the Israeli mall continues to boom and new mega centers are actively popping up and experiencing high traffic thanks to the more holistic approach.\nBIG Fashion Glilot, is set to finish construction in November. At 30,000 square meters of commerce and the largest BIG center in Israel, the new space has been labeled as a “unique lifestyle complex” with “an international-level shopping and entertainment experience.”\nBIG is one of the leading mall developers in the country, founded in 1994 to develop “American-style open-air shopping centers in Israel.” Yet BIG has taken the American mall and done it better.\nView of the new BIG shopping center, near Glilot, June 3, 2024. (Yossi Aloni/FLASH90)\n“It’s really a lifestyle. Every store has its own unique facade. The environment is like you’re going inside a street with lots of vegetation and balconies and water elements,” BIG Shopping Centers chief of staff Etay Elder said of the company’s open-air centers, focusing on how crucial fresh air and sunshine are to the success of Israeli centers.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDespite massive dips in revenue and performance around October 7, several mall developers have shown impressive growth over the past year. In its second-quarter results, the Azrieli Group reported sales were up NIS 46 million from a year ago, though revenue and net income was lower. The Melsiron company, which owns and manages malls across Israel, is up 16% over the last year.\nWhy is it that the malls continue to thrive?\n“Israelis love to shop,” said the Retail Innovation Club’s Paran.\nAnd with fewer Israelis flying abroad due to challenging skies, canceled flights and uncertainty, that love of shopping can only be sated locally.\n“Israelis are not going abroad so a lot of money is staying inside the country,” said Azrieli Group’s Oren, who also stressed that malls operate as a safe space for customers during an anxious time.\n“The economy is very, very strong. Even now with a war going on, the economy is strong,” said Oren."}

According to the research by Prof. Danny Ben-Shahar, director of the Alrov Institute for Real Estate Research at Tel Aviv University’s Coller School of Management, and Dr. David Ash, a research associate at the institute, those listing homes on Yad2, the leading classified services site in Israel, lose out on a wad of extra cash, despite saving money while posting the initial advertisement.\nBy analyzing over 15,000 listings between 2014 and 2016 on Yad2, Ben-Shahar and Ash found a noticeable gap between paid and free ad services: properties listed through paid services sold for 3.5 percent to 3.8% more than those using free listings. That’s an average of $12,000 to $13,000 earned.\n00:00 / 00:00\nHomes sold via paid ads also got more attention and moved faster, gaining 130% higher clicks than those listed on free ads and selling 10% to 18% quicker.\nThe study put the “zero price effect” on full display. This psychological bias shows that people place a heavy weight on things being free, even when spending some money could have a larger financial benefit long term. The researchers say they believe their report to be the first to present evidence of a tangible economic loss thanks to the zero-price effect, adding to growing research into the human psychological impact on economic results.\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe specific behavioral economics phenomenon is a result of a lack of rational thinking when it comes to financial decisions, say the researchers, leading homeowners to forego standard cost-benefit comparison due to impartiality toward free goods and services.\n“Zero is a special number. People feel and think that a service or product that they get for free has better qualities, even if you give them the same product or the same service for a difference of one cent,” Ash told The Times of Israel. “The ‘free’ is the problem. When someone sees free, it’s hard. If you see a free service, you think it’s better, even though the premium service that costs money is much better.”\nLeft: Prof. Danny Ben-Shahar, director of the Alrov Institute for Real Estate Research at Tel Aviv University’s Coller School of Management.

(Courtesy)\nWhile residential real estate can still be listed for free, Yad2 began charging for its previously free basic package for commercial real estate in 2019, as well as upped the cost of the higher-tier premium service. After eliminating the chance to opt for an entirely free service, “a very significant difference” in the number of sellers selected the more costly of the two available for-pay options, putting the behavioral economics of home sales and pricing on display.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPrior to the change, 94% of sellers chose the basic option — which was free at the time. But after the basic option was no longer free, only 85.7% opted for it, showing that once users had to spend any kind of money, they were willing to spend more. The “free” option had been the only thing in the way.\nBen-Shahar says the study as a whole serves as a warning for homeowners looking to sell to pay attention to their own biases and think logically when making selling decisions.\n“The tendency to be attracted to a zero price, one needs to be very cautious,” Ben-Shahar told The Times of Israel. “Generally, we do a cost-benefit analysis, but when things come to a zero price, we don’t do this analysis in the same way.”\nEven though the ad is free, Ben-Shahar points out the deeper truth: “There is a cost.”"}
