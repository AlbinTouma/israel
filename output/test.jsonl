They can see the tanks, they can see the armoured vehicles,\u201d said Al Jazeera\u2019s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City.Ten people were killed earlier this week trying to access food distribution points, and images showed many being herded into cage-like lines. Palestinians doing all they can to get hold of any aid for their families must risk Israeli fire and military forces.\u201cThere are also reports of enforced disappearances. A lot of families reported that many of their children, of their family members, who went to the sites \u2026 have gone missing as they were trying to get food,\u201d Mahmoud said.The aid delivery scheme has been roundly condemned by UN officials and the humanitarian community, who have accused the group of aiding Israel\u2019s war objectives by forcibly displacing Palestinians under the guise of aid.Critics maintain that the currently inadequate aid could be safely scaled up in Gaza, if Israel would allow access to aid and let the organisations that have decades of experience handle the flow.\u201cThrough this dangerous and reckless approach, food is not being distributed where it\u2019s needed most but is instead directed only to areas where Israeli forces choose to amass civilians,\u201d said Doctors Without Borders Secretary-General Christopher Lockyear. \u201cThis means the most vulnerable \u2013 especially the elderly and people with disabilities \u2013 have virtually no chance of accessing the food they desperately need.\u201dFamine is declared in an area where at least 20 percent of households face an extreme lack of food. At famine levels of deprivation, 30 percent of children suffer from acute malnutrition, and at least four children in every 10,000 die each day from starvation or malnutrition-linked disease. OCHA said at least 1 in 5 people in Gaza is currently facing starvation.Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, says it\u2019s \u201csafe to say there is famine\u201d in Gaza. Fakhri told Al Jazeera that Israel is using aid \u201cas bait to corral people\u201d and push them out of the north and into militarised zones\u201d.The humanitarian situation in Gaza was already catastrophic when Israel imposed a total blockade on March 2, causing conditions to deteriorate even further. After growing international pressure, Israeli authorities said they would allow minimal supplies of food and medicine into the Strip, but critical supplies are still not reaching the people.The chorus of condemnation against Israel was underscored by France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron on Friday. The French leader warned that Paris could \u201capply sanctions\u201d unless the Israeli government responds to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.Speaking during a visit to Singapore on Friday, Macron said the international community could not remain passive while Palestinians in Gaza face a deepening hunger crisis that is \u201cuntenable\u201d.\u201cIf there is no response in the coming hours and days in line with the humanitarian situation, we will have to harden our collective position,\u201d he added, suggesting that France may consider applying sanctions against Israeli settlers.At least 30 people have been killed since dawn on Friday in attacks in southern Deir el-Balah, northern Jabalia and on eastern Khan Younis.The Israeli army has also been expanding its military operation on the ground, issuing new forced displacement orders for five areas in northern Gaza. According to a UN spokesperson, nearly 200,000 people have been displaced in Gaza in the last two weeks by Israel\u2019s displacement orders.Meanwhile, hopes for an elusive truce remained unrealised. Hamas said on Friday it is currently reviewing a new US ceasefire proposal that Washington says has been signed off on by Israel, but that in its current form will only result in \u201cthe continuation of killing and famine\u201d in Gaza.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday that Israel had \u201csigned off\u201d on the ceasefire proposal, and the Trump administration\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, had submitted it to Hamas for consideration.Trump said he believes his administration will have an announcement later on Friday, \u201cor maybe tomorrow\u201d.\u201cWe have a chance of that,\u201d he told reporters from the Oval Office.The details of the new proposal have not been made public, but senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told the news agency Reuters that, crucially, it did not contain commitments from Israel to end its war on Gaza, withdraw from the enclave, or allow aid to freely enter the war-torn territory."}
