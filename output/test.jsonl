The updated proposal submitted by Hamas envisions the release of the 10 hostages being spread out more throughout the 60-day truce, rather than in two batches on the first and seventh day, as the US offer envisioned.\n00:00 / 23:33\nThe source said this change was aimed at preventing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from abandoning talks on a permanent ceasefire after the 10 hostages are released or refusing to engage in the talks altogether, as he did during the previous ceasefire in January.\nAn Israeli official told The Times of Israel that Hamas had also requested a ceasefire lasting up to seven years.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nWitkoff said: \u201cHamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThat is the only way we can close a 60-day ceasefire deal in the coming days, in which half of the living hostages and half of those who are deceased will come home to their families, and in which we can have at the proximity talks substantive negotiations in good faith to try to reach a permanent ceasefire.\u201d\nThe Witkoff proposal stipulates that the parties would have to reach an agreement on the parameters of Israel\u2019s partial withdrawal from Gaza during the 60-day truce. It also provides for further negotiations during the truce on a potential settlement to end the war.\nAn Israeli official told reporters on condition of anonymity that Jerusalem was treating Hamas\u2019s response to the proposal as an \u201ceffective rejection.\u201d\nDemonstrators protest against the Israeli government and for the release of Israelis held hostage in the Gaza Strip outside Hakirya Base in Tel Aviv, May 31, 2025. (Tomer Neuberg/Flash90)\nSenior Hamas official Basem Naim told Reuters that the terror group had not rejected the proposal, arguing that Israel\u2019s response was incompatible with what the group agreed on.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe added that Witkoff\u2019s position toward the terror group was \u201cunfair\u201d and showed \u201ccomplete bias\u201d toward Israel.\nThe latest US proposal was sent to Hamas earlier this week after Israel\u2019s lead negotiator, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, signed off on it.\nArab mediators are still working with the group to soften some of the edits it demanded, a source involved in the process told The Times of Israel.\nRelated: Full text of Witkoff\u2019s proposal for 60-day Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal\nIn a statement on Saturday, Hamas said it seeks a permanent ceasefire and a comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from Gaza \u2014 demands the Israeli government has largely rejected at this stage \u2014 and an ensured flow of aid.\nIn its own response to Hamas, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office said: \u201cWhile Israel has agreed to the updated Witkoff framework for the release of our hostages, Hamas continues to cling to its refusal.\u201d\nEchoing Witkoff\u2019s statement, the PMO said, \u201cIt is unacceptable and sets the process back.\u201d\n\u201cIsrael will continue its efforts to bring our hostages home and to defeat Hamas,\u201d it said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nChannel 12 reported that Israeli officials involved in talks told families of hostages on Saturday that, if carried out, the Witkoff proposal would ultimately lead to the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and would not be only a partial deal for some of the hostages.\nThere are currently 58 hostages held in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF, and 20 hostages who are believed to be alive. There are grave concerns for the well-being of three others, Israeli officials have said.\nOn Friday, US President Donald Trump had said that mediators were \u201cvery close\u201d to reaching a deal between Israel and Hamas. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know about it during the day or maybe tomorrow, and we have a chance of that,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.\nAsked later Friday if he thought Hamas would accept the proposal, Trump said, \u201cI think they want to \u2014 they want to get out of that mess.\u201d\nSources familiar with the negotiations told The Times of Israel that Hamas was disappointed with the proposal, since it still gives Israel the option to resume fighting at the end of the temporary truce.\nWhile Netanyahu told hostage families on Thursday that he was principally supportive of the deal on the table, he has yet to bring it before the cabinet to be approved, and several far-right members of his coalition have come out against it.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz said Friday that Hamas must agree to the proposal or be destroyed. \u201cThe Hamas murderers will now be forced to choose: accept the terms of the \u2018Witkoff Deal\u2019 for the release of the hostages \u2014 or be annihilated,\u201d he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsrael has repeatedly said that the destruction of the terror group is a key aim of the war.\nNegotiations to end nearly 20 months of war in Gaza have so far failed to achieve a breakthrough, with Israel resuming operations in March following a short-lived truce. Conditions on the ground for Gaza\u2019s civilians are dire, with the United Nations warning that the entire population is at risk of famine.\nAccording to a copy of Witkoff\u2019s latest proposal, the authenticity of which was confirmed to The Times of Israel by two sources familiar with the negotiations, Hamas would release 10 living Israeli hostages held in Gaza and return the bodies of 18 deceased hostages during a 60-day ceasefire.\nIn return, Israel would release 125 Palestinian terror convicts serving life sentences, 1,111 Gazans detained since the start of the war on October 7, 2023, and 180 bodies of Palestinians currently held by Israel.\nThe IDF would also pull back from some areas where troops are currently deployed; the parameters of the pullback would be finalized \u201cduring proximity negotiations.\u201d\nForeign Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar declared on Saturday that Hamas is responsible for the continuation of the war.\n\u201cHamas initiated this war with the 7/10 massacre [and] is responsible for its continuation by refusing to release our hostages and disarm,\u201d Sa\u2019ar wrote in an English-language post on X.\n\u201cIf France and the UK want to reach a ceasefire, pressure should be put on Hamas that continues to say No, instead of attacking Israel, which says Yes,\u201d he added, referring to the increasing criticism from Europe over the war.\nAgencies contributed to this report."}
