(Photo by Michael M. Santiago / Getty Images via AFP)\nAlexander, a dual citizen who grew up in New Jersey, was serving in the IDF’s Golani Brigade at the time of his abduction. He was kidnapped from his base near the Gaza border community of Nirim, known as the White House post, during the October 7 onslaught.\nIn a statement, Hamas announced on Sunday its decision to release Alexander after recent talks with US officials and “intensified efforts to achieve a ceasefire, open border crossings, and allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the US informed it of Hamas’s intent to release Alexander “without compensation or conditions” and that the step is expected to lead to negotiations on a truce.\nNetanyahu’s government was angered by US direct talks with Hamas earlier this year that led to a Hamas offer to release Alexander and the bodies of four other hostages if Israel recommitted to a stalled ceasefire deal. Days later, however, Israel resumed the war.\nUS President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff told AP that Hamas’s goal in releasing Alexander was to restart talks on a ceasefire, the release of additional hostages and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza before Israel carries out a threatened total takeover of the territory.\nIndirect talks between Hamas and the US began five days ago, an Egyptian official and a senior Hamas official told AP, with both describing the release of Alexander as a goodwill gesture.\nAlexander will be the first male hostage soldier abducted by Hamas on October 7, 2023, to be returned to Israel by the terror group.\nOn October 7, Hamas took 19 male soldiers hostage — not all of them on duty — and seven female surveillance soldiers, the latter of whom have all since been returned to Israel (five in a deal with Hamas, one rescued alive, and the body of one recovered by troops.)\nCurrently, Hamas is holding 14 male Israeli soldiers hostage, eight of whom have been declared dead, among them the body of Lt. Hadar Goldin, who was killed in 2014.\nThe apparent pause comes as Israel has been pushing ahead with its military operations in Gaza.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Israeli Air Force struck over 50 targets in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, the military said, including cells of terror operatives and buildings used by terror groups to plan and carry out attacks.\nAdditionally, the IDF said ground forces targeted a Hamas command center, caches of weapons, and sniper positions.\nHamas authorities reported 19 killed and dozens wounded during the previous 24 hours. The toll could not immediately be verified and did not differentiate between civilians and gunmen."}

We knew about the negotiations but not about such a dramatic development.”\nBoehler himself tweeted that the news of Alexander’s release was a positive step forward, adding: “We would also ask that Hamas release the bodies of four other Americans that were taken.”\nThe bodies of slain hostages Itay Chen, Omer Neutra, Gadi Haggai and Judith Weinstein Haggai are among the 59 captives still held by Hamas.

He was kidnapped from his base during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led onslaught that started the war in Gaza.

The officials who spoke with The Times of Israel said that — contrary to Hamas’s claim — no direct talks were held between the terror group and the US.\nHamas in its statement also said that it was prepared to enter intensified negotiations aimed at reaching a final agreement to end the war, establish a mutually “agreed prisoner exchange, and enable Gaza to be administered by an independent professional authority.”\nHamas uses the term “prisoner exchange” to refer to the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian security prisoners, including terrorists convicted of murdering Israelis.\nPalestinian security inmates released by Israel as part of a hostage release-ceasefire deal with Hamas are welcomed by family members as they arrive on buses to the European hospital in Khan Younis on February 1, 2025.

I look very much forward to that day of celebration!”\nQatar and Egypt welcomed the news in a joint statement, calling it “a gesture of goodwill and an encouraging step toward a return to the negotiating table to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, the release of prisoners and detainees, and ensure the safe and unhindered flow of aid to address the tragic conditions in the Strip.”\nThe US did not brief Israel on the effort to release Alexander until after the deal with Hamas was reached, the source familiar with the details of Alexander’s release told The Times of Israel.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsrael was generally aware that efforts were ongoing, but only knew about them from its own intelligence operations.

The responsibility lies with the Israeli government,” it added. “Nobody can be left behind.”\nTerror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 59 hostages, including 58 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023. They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF.\nHamas released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals — and the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives during a ceasefire between January and March. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. In exchange, Israel has freed some 2,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners, and Gazan terror suspects detained during the war.\nEight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014.\nThe body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt. Hadar Goldin, is still being held by Hamas, and is counted among the 59 hostages.\nAgencies contributed to this report."}

We’re going to be successful in getting Edan home.”\nIt is comments like these that keep Yael Alexander in a constant state of adrenaline rush.\n“It’s like a rollercoaster,” she told The Times of Israel. “I feel like I’m on the edge of falling since October 7. I live on 100% adrenaline all day, but this is how you feel when your son is in captivity in Hamas tunnels and you need to get him out, and fast.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nEvery day since that day has held this same sense of urgency for Yael and Adi Alexander, who were born and raised in Israel and have lived with their three children in the US for the last 20 years.\nYael Alexander holds a poster of her son, Edan, who was taken hostage by Hamas on October 7, 2023, during a weekly rally for families of hostages held in the Gaza Strip and their supporters, in Tel Aviv, February 22, 2025. (AP Photo/ Maya Alleruzzo)\nThis week, however, carries an additional layer of urgency, said Alexander, as the first phase of the current hostage deal with Hamas is drawing to a close, and the second phase, which would hopefully include Edan Alexander and the other 62 remaining hostages, has not yet been negotiated.\n“It’s a very critical moment,” said Alexander, a custom cake designer and artist who has not worked since her son was taken hostage. “This fight is bigger than anything I could have ever imagined.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nShe described a sense of action with US President Donald Trump that she felt was not present in the previous administration.\n“Trump tweets, he speaks about it, he feels passionate about it and wants it,” said Alexander. “Maybe he speaks the Middle Eastern language?”\nVarda Ben Baruch and Yael Alexander, grandmother and mother of hostage Edan Alexander, in Tel Aviv, on February 23, 2025. (Jessica Steinberg/Times of Israel)\nFor the last 16-plus months, Alexander and her husband have commuted between Israel, their Tenafly home, and Washington, DC, for a combination of meetings, interviews, and rallies. Only their youngest, Roy, now 13, is still living at home. His older sister, Mika, is away at college.\n“It’s very tough to fight for your beautiful boy and to have a normal family life,” said Alexander. “We are all over the place and I’m always feeling that it’s not enough.”\nWhen Alexander and her husband are in Israel, they lean on their family, including Yael’s parents and four siblings, three of whom live in the same Tel Aviv building where Yael’s father has lived for his entire life.\nVarda Ben Baruch, Yael’s mother, is present at every Hostages Square rally and often at Shift 101 sit-ins, a now-familiar sight in her fedora and bright lipstick, a poster of Edan held high.\nADVERTISEMENT\nVarda Ben Baruch, grandmother of Edan Alexander who is held hostage by Hamas in Gaza, holds a sign as she standing outside the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem, January 23, 2025. (Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)\n“I’m the matriarch of the family,” said Ben Baruch in her living room, which is decorated with the many bronze sculptures she has crafted over the years, an impressive collection of silver Judaica, and portraits of Edan, who has his own room at his grandparents’ apartment. “I have to save my strength for everyone, for my husband, for my kids, for my grandkids, and for Edan.”\nBen Baruch said that she and her husband were like “secondary parents” to Edan when he became a soldier, doing his laundry, and tending his cuts and bruises as he underwent basic training.\nShe said she was shocked when the government did not bring home all the hostages in the days after October 7.\n“I was sure that after five days, the government would bring us our kids,” said Ben Baruch. “The war didn’t start right away,” she said, referring to the Gaza ground operation.\n“I’m not angry,” said Ben Baruch. “I ask and I demand, because anger won’t do anything. It’s abuse to humans to have hostages there. They have to think about the families and the hostages.”\nHer daughter, Yael, the third of her five children, happened to be in Israel on October 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked the Gaza border communities and towns. The Alexanders had planned to be in Israel about once a month while Edan was serving in the army.\nEdan had been home in the US for August 2023, and once the Jewish high holidays had passed, Yael Alexander traveled to Israel to spend part of Sukkot with Edan and the rest of her family, before he went back to his base for the end of the holiday.\nEdan Alexander was taken captive by Hamas terrorists on October 7, 2023. (Courtesy)\nShe spoke to him at 7 a.m. on October 7, soon after the Hamas attack began, and minutes before he was taken captive by Hamas terrorists. The rest of the Alexanders — Adi, Mika and Roy — flew to Israel to join her, and it was on October 12 that the family found out that Edan was taken hostage.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“When they arrived on October 9, I cried like a little girl,” she said. “I didn’t have answers because we didn’t know where Edan was. I still see that moment in my life, I had never cried like that. Maybe I’ll cry like that when I see Edan.”\nThe family has received several signs of life of Edan, from hostages who were freed in November 2023 and had met him, handcuffed in the tunnels. He told them he was an American-Israeli soldier, was hugged by one hostage and was given water to drink with the help of another hostage.\nIn November 2024, Alexander was seen again in a Hamas propaganda video, his face thin and wan, with dark circles under his eyes.\nEdan Alexander, 20, held hostage by Hamas, is seen in a propaganda video by the terror group that was released on November 30, 2024. (Video screenshot)\nYael Alexander was in Israel that week, wanting to be geographically closer to Edan on his favorite American holiday, Thanksgiving.\nThe American-Israeli soldier is now the last known American hostage taken by Hamas terrorists on October 7 who is believed to still be alive.\nIn the first months after October 7, there were eight dual citizen American-Israelis. whose family members formed a group.\nIt consisted of the Alexanders, along with Rachel Goldberg and Jon Polin, the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin who was killed in captivity at the end of August; Orna and Ronen Neutra, the parents of Omer Neutra, another dual citizen soldier who was eventually discovered to have been killed on October 7 and his body taken captive; Iris Weinstein Haggai, daughter of Judy Weinstein Haggai, an American-Canadian-Israeli who was killed with her husband, Gadi Haggai, on October 7 and their bodies taken captive; and Ruby and Hagit Chen, the parents of Itay Chen, an Israeli soldier with dual American citizenship who was killed and his body taken hostage.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdi and Yael Alexander, first and second from left, along with other families of hostages in Gaza, speak with reporters following their meeting with President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the White House in Washington, July 25, 2024. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\nTwo hostages, Sagui Dekel-Chen, an Israeli with American citizenship, and Keith Siegel, an American who immigrated to Israel decades ago, were released from captivity in the last few weeks.\n“It’s different now because the group is much smaller,” said Alexander. “Some have had terrible news, some have had happy endings, but it’s very tough. At the starting point, almost everyone was alive, and suddenly you get bad news, bad news, the worst news.”\nThe last week has brought its own set of painful challenges, as the bodies of Oded Lifshitz, Shiri Bibas, and the two little Bibas boys were brought back in coffins, followed by the release of another Hamas video, this one of two hostages, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal, forced by their captors to watch the release of Saturday’s captives.\n“It’s a sick, sick game,” said Alexander. “It’s the cruelest thing to see. We need to save them, and I hope Trump sees that video.”\nFor now, said Alexander, they are waiting for some decisions on phase two of the deal, hoping that her son is on the list.\nShe worries about the horrific conditions in the Gaza tunnels, knowing that Edan is most probably kept in a similar state as other hostages have been, in the thin air of the tunnels, without sunlight, in filth and torturous conditions.\n“Edan has to stay strong,” she said. “I want him to know that we’re coming nonstop to be here, near him, and we’ll be here when he’s released.”"}

Trump will depart on Monday for Saudi Arabia before making stops in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. He is not slated to visit Israel on this trip.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nOver the weekend, Hamas informed the go-between that it had agreed to release Alexander unconditionally but wanted Witkoff to know that the step should not be viewed as a one-off, the sources said. Hamas stressed to the mediator that it was ready to work with the Trump administration to secure a permanent ceasefire in Gaza with security arrangements in order to ensure a yearslong calm until a final settlement of the conflict is reached, the sources said.\nUS special envoy to the Mideast Steve Witkoff speaks at an Israeli Embassy in Washington event marking Independence Day, May 5, 2025 (Israeli Embassy in Washington)\nHamas also told the US via the backchannel that it needed to locate Alexander. Last month, it released a propaganda video showing Alexander alive. Two days later, the group claimed it had lost contact with his captors after an Israeli airstrike.\nOn Sunday, Hamas told the mediator that it had found Alexander and was prepared to move ahead with his release. The negotiator, in turn told Hamas to inform Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani of the decision. The Qatari premier then called Witkoff to confirm that Alexander’s release would be moving ahead.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWitkoff then called Netanyahu and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to inform them of the development, the US official said. Israel then agreed to temporary halt some of its military operations, including drone surveillance of the Strip in the lead-up and during Alexander’s release on Monday, the source familiar with the matter said.\nAfter receiving the news from Witkoff, Alexander’s parents took off for Israel from the US on Sunday night and were accompanied by US hostage envoy Adam Boehler.\nNetanyahu’s office issued a statement early Monday morning claiming that Alexander’s release was made possible due to Israel’s military pressure in Gaza. It stressed that Israel did not agree to a ceasefire or to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Alexander — only to provide a safe corridor to allow for his release.\nIn an earlier statement attributed to an “Israeli official,” Netanyahu’s office said that it was still prepared to accept the so-called “Witkoff proposal” through which Hamas agrees to release half of the hostages up front in exchange for a weekslong truce during which the sides agree to hold talks on the terms of a permanent end to the war.\nRepublican US presidential nominee Donald Trump poses for photos with family members of Edan Alexander, a hostage held by Hamas, after visiting the gravesite of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, October 7, 2024, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)\nSuch talks were supposed to have been held during the previous agreement that the sides signed in January, but Netanyahu largely refused to engage in such negotiations, amid pressure from his far-right coalition partners who threatened to collapse his government if he agreed to end the war.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccordingly, Hamas has insisted on ironclad guarantees, such as a UN Security Council resolution, in order to ensure that Israel holds those talks and agrees to end the war.\nIn addition to releasing the hostages, Israel is demanding that Hamas dismantle its governing and military capabilities. While the group has said it is prepared to forgo control of the Strip to an independent committee of Palestinian technocrats, it has held off on the demand to permanently disarm."}

The responsibility lies with the Israeli government,” it added. “Nobody can be left behind.”\nTerror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 59 hostages, including 58 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023. They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF.\nHamas released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals — and the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives during a ceasefire between January and March. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. In exchange, Israel has freed some 2,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners, and Gazan terror suspects detained during the war.\nEight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014.\nThe body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt. Hadar Goldin, is still being held by Hamas, and is counted among the 59 hostages.\nAgencies contributed to this report."}

It’s abuse to humans to have hostages there. They have to think about the families and the hostages.”\nHer daughter, Yael, the third of her five children, happened to be in Israel on October 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked the Gaza border communities and towns. The Alexanders had planned to be in Israel about once a month while Edan was serving in the army.\nEdan had been home in the US for August 2023, and once the Jewish high holidays had passed, Yael Alexander traveled to Israel to spend part of Sukkot with Edan and the rest of her family, before he went back to his base for the end of the holiday.\nEdan Alexander was taken captive by Hamas terrorists on October 7, 2023.

The rest of the Alexanders — Adi, Mika and Roy — flew to Israel to join her, and it was on October 12 that the family found out that Edan was taken hostage.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“When they arrived on October 9, I cried like a little girl,” she said. “I didn’t have answers because we didn’t know where Edan was. I still see that moment in my life, I had never cried like that. Maybe I’ll cry like that when I see Edan.”\nThe family has received several signs of life of Edan, from hostages who were freed in November 2023 and had met him, handcuffed in the tunnels.

At the starting point, almost everyone was alive, and suddenly you get bad news, bad news, the worst news.”\nThe last week has brought its own set of painful challenges, as the bodies of Oded Lifshitz, Shiri Bibas, and the two little Bibas boys were brought back in coffins, followed by the release of another Hamas video, this one of two hostages, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal, forced by their captors to watch the release of Saturday’s captives.\n“It’s a sick, sick game,” said Alexander. “It’s the cruelest thing to see. We need to save them, and I hope Trump sees that video.”\nFor now, said Alexander, they are waiting for some decisions on phase two of the deal, hoping that her son is on the list.\nShe worries about the horrific conditions in the Gaza tunnels, knowing that Edan is most probably kept in a similar state as other hostages have been, in the thin air of the tunnels, without sunlight, in filth and torturous conditions.\n“Edan has to stay strong,” she said. “I want him to know that we’re coming nonstop to be here, near him, and we’ll be here when he’s released.”"}

(Courtesy of Alexander family)\nTrump now understands that Netanyahu “is an obstacle to security and the release of the hostages,” Golan continued, asserting that occupying the Gaza Strip will only lead to more deaths and “economic devastation.”\nOpposition Leader Yair Lapid also criticized the government for allowing itself to be cut out of the loop, stating that it represented “a diplomatic failure with consequences that endanger the security and well-being of the entire State of Israel.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“This alliance [with the US] is the greatest strategic asset that the State of Israel has,” but while the Trump administration praises the Netanyahu government publicly, the “Americans are fed up with Netanyahu,” Lapid asserted.\n“The Trump administration is operating today without coordination and without listening to Netanyahu. They have reached a ceasefire with the Houthis in Yemen behind his back, are conducting dangerous negotiations with the Iranians, are promoting a Saudi nuclear program, and are making a hostage deal only for their own citizens,” Lapid said. “There has never been anything like this.”\n“Trump is a pro-Israel president. He loves Israel, but he hates dragging his feet, and postponements and delays, and hesitation, and lies,” Lapid continued. “He wants a ceasefire in Gaza, he wants a big hostage deal, he wants regional agreements that will help the American economy. Netanyahu does not know how to give him that. Not with this government.”\nYisrael Beytenu chairman Avigdor Liberman sounded a similar note, telling reporters that, “unfortunately, [Alexander’s] return is not happening as a result of Israeli pressure or a decision, but as a result of direct contact between the US and Hamas.”\nOpposition leader and Yesh Atid party head MK Yair Lapid speaks at a faction meeting in the Knesset on May 12, 2025. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nIsrael has “reached an unprecedented low” in its relations with the United States, Liberman argued, bemoaning “the [US] ceasefire with the Houthis when the State of Israel is left out of the agreement, the US president’s visit to the region when he skips Israel, [and] the direct negotiations between the US and Iran.”\nLast week, Trump announced that the US would stop bombing Yemen’s Houthis, after the Iran-backed group agreed to stop interrupting important shipping lanes in the Middle East.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe announcement did not mention the ongoing Houthi attacks on Israel, and a spokesman for the Yemeni rebel group pledged that such strikes would continue. Israeli officials told Hebrew media outlets that Washington did not give Jerusalem advance notice of the announcement, and that Israel was surprised by it.\nTrump also reportedly quashed Israeli proposals for a series of joint strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, opting instead to try for a diplomatic solution to the problem of Tehran’s nuclear program.\nThe Trump administration has sent mixed messages regarding Iran, stating both that it wants Tehran’s nuclear program completely destroyed and also insisting that it is open to letting the Islamic Republic pursue civilian nuclear energy.\nAt the same time, Trump is heading to the Middle East on Monday on a multi-country tour in which the US president will skip Israel, but will stop in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, leading government critics to warn that Jerusalem is being left out of Washington’s regional diplomatic initiatives.\nUS President Donald Trump takes questions outside the West Wing of White House in Washington, DC, on May 8, 2025. (Jim WATSON / AFP)\nAccording to Arabic media reports, Trump is also set to meet Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, and Syria’s de facto leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa.\nAnd despite previously insisting that Saudi Arabia will join the Abraham Accords— the series of normalization agreements that his previous administration brokered between Israel and several Arab states — Trump has reportedly dropped normalization with Israel as a condition for progress on Saudi Arabia’s civilian nuclear program.\nAgainst this backdrop, National Unity chairman Benny Gantz warned on Monday that Israel must get on board with American plans for the Middle East or be left behind.\nAddressing the press ahead of his party’s weekly faction meeting, Gantz said that “the American administration is determined to promote normalization with Saudi Arabia and other large and significant countries in the region.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Either we complete a strategic transformation, strengthen the axis against Iran, destroy its military nuclear capability, and become part of a vast comprehensive political move led by the United States in the region, or we will be left behind,” he warned. “The opportunity to change the Middle East must not be missed because of political considerations.”\n‘We must stop procrastinating and go on the offensive’\nFar-right members of Netanyahu’s coalition pushed back hard against such criticism, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich declaring, “You have to be crazy to turn an event like [Edan Alexander’s release] into something that is against the government.”\nFinance Minister Religious Zionist party head Bezalel Smotrich leads a faction meeting at the Knesset in Jerusalem, May 12, 2025. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\n“A heroic fighter, a lone soldier who came to Israel to enlist in the army and serve the homeland, is released from captivity without any compensation or conditions — we are not releasing a single terrorist, we are not delivering humanitarian aid, we are not stopping the war and we are not surrendering,” Smotrich told reporters in the Knesset ahead of his Religious Zionism party’s weekly faction meeting.\n“Just two months ago, there were those who were talking about how, in order to free Edan, we would have to release 250 murderous terrorists with blood on their hands,” but now he is being freed “because we have created military and political pressure on Hamas,” Smotrich claimed.\nHamas “understands that we have no intention of surrendering and if it wants something, it is the one who has to pay upfront and not the other way around,” he asserted — adding that the government is “committed to bringing about everyone’s release.”\nNational Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir also endorsed a more aggressive approach in Gaza, telling reporters that Israel had “received American backing to open the gates of hell on Gaza — we must stop procrastinating, and go on the offensive to defeat it.”\nIn an appeal to Netanyahu, Ben Gvir said that “President Trump gave us backing several months ago to open the gates of hell on Hamas, and we are delaying. We must stop delaying and launch the decisive attack. To occupy the entire territory of the Gaza Strip, and to encourage the migration of Gazans to countries around the world.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nSmotrich and Ben Gvir’s comments, however, appeared at odds with recent statements by senior American officials.\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff arrives for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin (not in picture) in Moscow, Russia, April 25, 2025.

My people are in the White House — including just two to three days ago, they were there…We are currently blessed with a president and an administration that is very, very friendly. And we’re trying to coordinate both the big things as well as the small things,” concluded Netanyahu, referring to a visit last week to the White House by Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer.\nUS Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff added his voice to the growing chorus of officials denying any tensions between the two leaders, in an interview with the right-wing Breitbart news site conducted last week and published Sunday evening.\n“Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli people are a staunch ally of the United States, and it goes back the other way,” said Witkoff. “I’ve been at multiple meetings with the president and the prime minister—they’re friendly. They’re good friends, in fact.”\nHe said this does not mean they see eye-to-eye “on absolutely everything,” but that the media “hears about a small disagreement… then conflates that into some large article about massive issues that they have.”\nUS special envoy to the Mideast Steve Witkoff speaks at an Israeli Embassy in Washington event marking Independence Day, May 5, 2025 (Israeli Embassy in Washington)\n“Israel is a great partner for the United States, strategically, economically. We think very much alike, we have very similar objectives,” the US envoy said. “They don’t want to see a weaponized nuclear state in the state of Iran. And so, I don’t think there’s much daylight between how they think and how we think from a foreign policy perspective.”\nChannel 12 reported Sunday that Witkoff recently told hostages’ families that he disagrees with Israel’s approach to the war in the Strip, and believes that Israel is pointlessly extending the war when reaching a new ceasefire and hostage release deal is the correct next step to take.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsrael is planning to launch a major military offensive against Hamas in Gaza if no hostage deal is reached with the terror group by the end of Trump’s visit to the region.\nChannel 12 cited the families as saying they had not heard this kind of criticism of Israeli government policy from Witkoff in the past.\nFormer US ambassador to Israel David Friedman, who served under the first Trump administration, also asserted in an X post, “There is NO RIFT between President Trump and PM Netanyahu. There are those in both the US and Israel who would like to see such a rift, and they are feeding false accounts to the media to achieve just that. But it’s all fake.”\nCurrent US Ambassador Mike Huckabee tried to quell the rumors of tensions in interviews with Israeli networks Saturday, asserting that the US president was not snubbing Israel by skipping the Jewish state during his upcoming visit.\nJerusalem is reportedly unhappy with the ongoing US-Iran talks, which are said to be developing into a largely similar framework to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, which was signed by then-US president Barack Obama and was panned at the time by Netanyahu as disastrous for Israel.\nUnder the terms being discussed, according to reports, Iran would limit stockpile size and centrifuge types, and dilute, export, or seal its 60 percent uranium stock under unprecedented International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) scrutiny, in exchange for substantial sanctions relief.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis approach has not aligned with Netanyahu’s longtime position, which is that Israel will not allow Iran to attain nuclear weapons and is opposed to any talks that don’t lead Iran to agree to a “Libya-style agreement,” under which Tehran’s entire nuclear program — both military and civilian — would be dismantled completely.\nIn addition, Israel had not been made aware in advance of a recent deal signed between the US and the Houthi rebels in Yemen regarding a cessation of US bombing if the Iran-backed rebels stop firing on US shipping, which notably left the door open for Houthi strikes on Israel to go unabated.\nSecurity forces at the site where a missile fired from Yemen hit an area of Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, on May 4, 2025.(Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)\nThat deal was announced by Trump two days after a Houthi missile impacted the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport, a few hundred yards from the main control tower, lightly injuring several people and prompting most foreign airlines to halt flights to Israel.\nIsrael’s Channel 13 reported Sunday evening that people in Netanyahu’s inner circle have expressed unusually harsh criticism toward the Trump administration in recent weeks.\n“There’s chaos in the Trump administration — the right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing,” said a senior figure close to the premier, according to the report.\n“It’s not even clear if this has anything to do with us. Everything operates according to the president’s whims. Sometimes that works in our favor, and sometimes it doesn’t,” the source said.\nThe premier’s office also expressed disappointment in the White House through Dermer, during a meeting last Thursday between the top Netanyahu adviser and Trump, the report added.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn the US, Fox News also reported on the rift, citing analysts as saying Netanyahu stood as a “roadblock” to Trump’s diplomatic initiatives in the region, adding that Israel was not part of securing the expected release of US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, who was kidnapped during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led onslaught that started the war in Gaza.\nOfficials told The Times of Israel the move was a goodwill gesture by Hamas ahead of Trump’s Middle East visit, hoping that he will coax Israel to sign a deal freeing the remaining hostages in exchange for an end to the war."}

(Evan Vucci/AP)\nEstablishing ties has become especially toxic for Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered on October 7, 2023, when the Palestinian terror group Hamas led a devastating invasion of southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 taken as hostages to Gaza.\nAs such, the issue, central to bilateral talks in Trump’s first term, has effectively been delinked from economic and other security matters between Washington and the kingdom, according to six other sources Reuters spoke with for this story, including two Saudi and two US officials. The people all asked to remain anonymous to speak about sensitive diplomatic conversations.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSaudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, needs the Gaza war to end and a credible path to a Palestinian state “before he re-engages with the issue of normalization,” said Dennis Ross, a former US negotiator.\nIn the meantime, Washington and Riyadh will focus Trump’s trip largely on the economic partnership and other regional matters, according to the six sources. Lucrative investments such as major deals in arms, mega-projects and artificial intelligence are in play, officials from both sides stressed.\nThe approach was cemented in diplomatic talks between Saudi and US officials ahead of the trip, the first formal state visit of Trump’s second term, they said.\nTrump’s stated aim is to secure a trillion-dollar investment in US companies, building on an initial commitment of $600 billion pledged by the crown prince.\nThe wealthy kingdom, the world’s top oil exporter, knows the ritual well: dazzle the guest, secure the favor. The goal, the sources told Reuters, is to evade diplomatic landmines and perhaps, one said, to win concessions from Trump on the Gaza war and its aftermath.\nUS President Donald Trump, left, shakes hands with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he leaves the West Wing of the White House, April 7, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n“The Trump administration wants this trip to be a big deal. That means lots of splashy deal announcements and collaborations that can be sold as being good for America,” said Robert Mogielnicki, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute, a think tank in Washington.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Normalizing ties with Israel is a much heavier lift than rolling out the red carpet for President Trump and announcing investment deals,” he said.\nA State Department spokesperson declined to comment on any understanding reached ahead of the trip, saying Trump “will look to strengthen ties between the United States and our Arab Gulf partners during the visits.”\nThe Saudi government communications office did not reply to a request for comment.\nCourt the kingdom\nBefore Hamas launched its October 7 attacks on Israel, the crown prince was finalizing a landmark diplomatic agreement: a US defense pact in exchange for Riyadh recognizing Israel.\nBut the scale of Israel’s campaign to destroy Hamas, topple its Gaza regime, and free the hostages forced a pause in the talks.\nThe Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 50,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though the toll cannot be verified and does not differentiate between civilians and fighters.\nIsrael says it has killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.\nIn November last year, bin Salman accused Israel of genocide.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraeli troops operate in Gaza in a photo published by the IDF on May 9, 2025. (Israel Defense Forces)\nFrustrated by the impact of Gaza’s prolonged crisis on normalization efforts, Trump could use his visit to unveil a US framework to end the 18-month war, the two Gulf sources said.\nThe plan could create a transitional government and new security arrangements for postwar Gaza, potentially reshaping regional diplomacy and opening the door to future normalization talks, they said.\nUnderscoring the high-stakes diplomacy underway, Trump met privately with Israel’s Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer on Thursday to discuss the war and nuclear talks with Iran, Axios reported.\nThe US State Department did not immediately respond to questions about Trump’s discussions on Gaza.\nTrump conspicuously has not announced a visit to Israel as part of his tour of the region. Two diplomats noted the US president has recently refrained from talking about his “Gaza Riviera” plan, which enraged the Arab world with the suggestion of resettling the entire Gazan population and US ownership of the strip.\nIn the build-up to the trip, Washington has taken a number of actions that are positive for Saudi Arabia. An agreement to stop US bombing of the Houthis in Yemen is in line with a Saudi ceasefire there. Washington has also delinked civil nuclear talks from the normalization question.\nThe stalled Saudi-US defense pact, initially conceived as a formal treaty, was revived in the scaled-back form of security guarantees late in the Biden presidency to bypass congressional opposition.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Trump administration has now picked up those talks, along with the discussions about a civilian nuclear agreement, three of the sources said, while cautioning that it will take time to define terms.\nChina influence\nTrump’s Saudi trip is his first formal state visit and second foreign trip since his re-election, after attending the pope’s funeral in Rome.

( AFP PHOTO / MANDEL NGAN)\nBeneath the showmanship of Trump’s visits, diplomats say, lies also a calculated US effort to reassert influence and reshape economic alignments in a region where Beijing — Washington’s chief economic rival — has steadily expanded its foothold at the heart of the petrodollar system.\nTrump’s first trip abroad in his first term also began in Riyadh, where he unveiled $350 billion in Saudi investments.\nTrump commands deep trust from the Saudi leadership, rooted in the close ties during his first term — a period defined by large arms deals and steadfast US backing for bin Salman, even as global outrage erupted over the killing of columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul.\nSaudi Arabia and its Gulf allies now plan to urge Trump to ease US regulations that have increasingly deterred foreign investment, particularly in sectors deemed part of America’s “critical national infrastructure,” five industry sources said.\nIn meetings with US officials, Saudi ministers will advocate for a more business-friendly climate, especially at a time when China is aggressively courting Gulf capital, the industry sources said.\nWhile countering China’s economic rise may top Trump’s foreign policy agenda, it won’t be easy in Saudi Arabia. Since the launch of Vision 2030, China has become integral to the kingdom’s plans, dominating sectors from energy and infrastructure to renewables."}

The Israeli government was also widely panned for being sidelined in the talks to secure Alexander’s release.\nThe US and Hamas both confirmed late Sunday that the terror group would release Alexander in what was described as a goodwill gesture to US President Donald Trump ahead of his visit to the region this week.\nIsrael, which sources said was not involved in talks for the release, claimed Monday the development was the result of its military pressure on Hamas, while opposition lawmakers and families of hostages panned the government for not having been a party to talks, for not pursuing a broad deal to bring all of the remaining hostages home, and for allowing negotiations to take place that apparently favored hostages with dual citizenship.\nAlexander, a dual citizen who grew up in New Jersey, was serving in the Israel Defense Forces at the time of his abduction. He was kidnapped from his base during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led onslaught that started the war in Gaza.

Ohel’s mother Idit has been particularly vocal against what she terms a form of selection between hostages during previous rounds of releases.\nAccording to the family, relying on information from freed hostages, Ohel has been kept bound in chains and received no medical attention for shrapnel in his eye and shoulder from wounds suffered on October 7, 2023.\n“With a broken heart,” the family’s statement offered good wishes to the Alexander family on their son’s impending freedom and urged Israel’s government to reach a deal securing the release of the rest of the hostages.\n“Alon and the rest of the injured hostages are being left behind in the tunnels with no medical attention or help,” the family said. “There is no date for the end of our nightmare.”\nEinav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, attends a conference at Tel Aviv University, May 7, 2025.

If Matan is left alone in the tunnel, Netanyahu is deciding to murder my boy; instead of releasing all of the hostages, he has become my private angel of death.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nZangauker, whose combative criticism of the government has made her a prominent activist on behalf of the hostages, vowed to “hunt down the prime minister” for the suffering caused to her son.\nThe family of Itay Chen, a dual US-Israeli citizen whose body is held in Gaza, said in a statement, “These are moments of mixed feelings. We rejoice in the joy of Yael and Adi Alexander, who will soon get to hug their son. Every hostage that comes home warms the hearts of the families of hostages. On the other hand, our hearts cannot bear the deep grief. It is possible, and necessary, to bring everyone back.”\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the main group representing hostage families, said in a statement Sunday that the release of Alexander “must be the start of a single agreement that will return all 59 [remaining] hostages.”\n“There is only one moral, proper, and necessary agreement: the immediate return of all the hostages and the end of the war,” said the forum, which has long been calling for the government to agree to a deal that will return all the remaining hostages at once, rather than in phases.\n“Now is the time to bring about a breakthrough in negotiations. The responsibility lies with the Israeli government,” it added. “Nobody can be left behind.”\nOn Monday, the forum announced a rally to be held at noon in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv in anticipation of Alexander’s release.\nVarda Ben Baruch holds a picture of her grandson Edan Alexander, who is held hostage in Gaza, as she gathers with other families to call out on loudspeakers in hopes that their loved ones will hear them, near the Gaza border in Kibbutz Nir Oz, southern Israel, April 20, 2025.

They have no time.”\nHe further said that reports of direct contact between the US and Hamas to reach the agreement “are a disgraceful failure of diplomacy by the Israeli government and the person who heads it. The hostages are ours, and the responsibility to return them is of the government.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nOpposition MK Benny Gantz, leader of the National Unity Party, posted that “the heart swells at the apparent return of Edan — the stomach turns to see how the Israeli government is absent from every initiative to take responsibility.”\n“The time has come for the prime minister to exercise that responsibility,” he wrote.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel has committed to facilitating a safe corridor for the return of Alexander.\nIn a statement, the Prime Minister’s Office said Jerusalem has, however, made no further promise for a ceasefire or for the release of Palestinian security prisoners, who have been exchanged for hostages in previous deals.\n“The expected release of IDF soldier Edan Alexander [by Hamas] without getting anything in return, will be possible thanks to the determined policy we led, with the backing of [US] President [Donald] Trump, and thanks to IDF troops’ military pressure in the Gaza Strip,” the PMO said.\n“We are in critical days in which Hamas is facing a deal that would enable our hostages’ release,” it added. “Negotiations will continue under fire and amidst preparations for the intensification of the fighting.”\nThen-Republican US presidential nominee Donald Trump poses for photos with the family of Edan Alexander at Ohel Chabad Lubavitch on October 7, 2024, in New York City.

We will continue to do everything to return all of our hostages.”\nThe official said Israel will facilitate a safe corridor to get Alexander out of Gaza — presumably meaning halting fighting and reconnaissance flights in certain areas — but stressed that there is no ceasefire and that Hamas isn’t getting anything in return for the release. If Hamas agrees to an Israel-accepted proposal for a wider hostage deal, the expansion of the war will be postponed, the official added.\n(From R-L) US hostage envoy Adam Boehler, Yael Alexander, Shira Boehler and Boehler’s chief of staff Raechel Greenberg on a plane from the US to Israel on May 11, 2025.

They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF. The Hamas attack also killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians.\nHamas released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals — and the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives during a ceasefire between January and March. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. In exchange, Israel has freed some 2,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners, and Gazan terror suspects detained during the war.\nEight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014.\nThe body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt. Hadar Goldin, is still being held by Hamas, and is counted among the 59 hostages."}

There are 59 pure souls who fit that definition, and each and every one of them must come home now. Bring back the hostages, end the war.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nHerut Nimrodi, the mother of captive IDF soldier Tamir Nimrodi, speaks at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, on May 10, 2025.

Every day is filled with anxiety. Every day is a struggle. Every day is an attempt to cling to a ‘maybe.’\n“All of us, all the families, are in such a heightened state of alert that every word, every sentence spoken in the media or in private conversations about our loved ones, jolts us out of our artificial calm. It makes it even harder for us to function in this already insane reality,” she said.\nOther speakers at the Hostages Square rally highlighted opinion polls indicating that some 70 percent of the public supports an end to the fighting in Gaza as part of a deal to bring back the hostages.\nThe comments came after Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich — who opposes a truce-hostage deal and who has consistently failed to cross the electoral threshold in recent surveys — reportedly told hostage families that he represents the majority of the public.\nIlan Dalal, whose son Guy Gilboa-Dalal is among the living captives, cited the reported 70% support, saying: “According to every poll, the nation has already chosen. It’s chosen the hostages.”\nAt a separate rally in Habima Square in Tel Aviv, known for drawing more government-critical crowds, Rafi Ben Shitrit, the father of Staff Sgt. Shimon Alroy Ben Shitrit, who was killed during the attack on an IDF base on October 7, lashed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for saying this week that he “sleep[s] with a clear conscience.”\n“This week, I heard the most failed of Israel’s leaders say that he sleeps with a clear conscience. A leader under whose tenure the greatest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust occurred. He sleeps with a clear conscience.

The crowd was dotted with Israeli flags, and chants including, “The entire nation knows that Bibi is a crook” — using the premier’s nickname.\nThe protest started with a moment of silence for five IDF soldiers killed fighting in Gaza this week.\nYael Adar, the mother of slain captive Tamir Adar, addresses protesters on Begin Road, in Tel Aviv, on May 10, 2025.

This weekend, it welcomed the first visitors to the Museum of Survivors, dedicated to the Holocaust and the history of Jews in this part of Europe.\nThe opening was timed to coincide with the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. It was also in May 1945 that Schindler received a golden ring from grateful Jewish survivors, made with gold taken from their teeth. The ring was inscribed with Hebrew words from the Talmud:”Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.”\nSchindler’s story was told in Steven Spielberg’s Oscar-winning movie, “Schindler’s List.”\nDaniel Löw-Beer was a driving force behind the project.

It includes a space for exhibitions, lectures, film screenings, and concerts, as well as a café.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA transparent glass wall between this part and the bigger, still ruined area behind it separates the present and history.\n“It’s a universal place of survivors,” Löw-Beer said. “We want those stories to be told and people to make their own opinions.”\nIn 2019, Löw-Beer set up the Arks Foundation to buy the warehouse and turn it into a museum, investing money and renewing a partnership with the local community to revive the neglected site.\nThe regional government contributed funds, while a grant from the European Union brought children from five European countries to Brněnec to come up with ideas that helped shape the museum design.\nThe official opening on the weekend completed the first step, but a lot remains to be done. The remaining buildings are still waiting to be fully restored. They include Schindler’s office, where the town hall plans to create an information center, the barracks of the SS troops, which will provide more exhibition spaces, and the entire building of Schindler’s Ark, where the Jewish prisoners lived and worked.\nCurrently, the museum is not open on a daily basis and focuses on educational activities for schools.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDaniel Low-Beer, whose family used to own a factory where Oskar Schindler saved some 1,200 Jews during WWII, talks to The Associated Press at the Museum of Survivors in Brnenec, Czech Republic, May 10, 2025.

When skeptical local residents could see something was really happening this time, they offered help. A firm came with a big truck loaded with bricks, dropped them, and just went off, Löw-Beer said.\n“We wanted to show that you have to do something for something else to happen,” said Milan Šudoma of the foundation. If organizers had waited until they had secured all the necessary funding, nothing would likely be done by now, he said.\n“Oskar and Emilie Schindler are proof that one person can make a difference,” the museum quotes Rena Finder, one of the Schindler’s Jews, as saying. “Everybody said there was nothing I could do.

With the Red Army approaching in 1944, he created a list of Jewish workers he claimed were needed to resettle the plant in Brněnec.\nOskar Schindler in Argentina after World War II (PD, Yad Vashem, via Wikipedia)\nWhen a transport with 300 women was diverted to the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz, Schindler managed to secure their release.\nYad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial center in Jerusalem, said it’s the only known case “that such a large group of people were allowed to leave alive while the gas chambers were still in operation.”\nIn another bold act, Emilie Schindler led an effort to save more than 100 Jewish male prisoners who arrived at a nearby train station in sealed cattle wagons in January 1945.\nIn 1993, Yad Vashem recognized Emilie and Oskar Schindler as Righteous Among the Nations, the honor awarded to those who rescued Jews from the Holocaust."}

East Germany never maintained full relations with Jerusalem.\nIn his first phone call to the premier since assuming office Thursday, Merz discussed Gaza and regional issues with Netanyahu, and also “reiterated that the existence and security of Israel are a part of German raison d’être,” according to a Berlin readout.\nGerman Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Museum, in Jerusalem on May 11, 2025. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nStanding alongside Wadephul at a press conference in Jerusalem, Sa’ar said Iran’s uranium enrichment facilities “must be dismantled” and that the US and Israel agree on this issue. Next to Sa’ar, Wadephul said, “Iran is an issue that greatly concerns” Germany.\n“The most dangerous regime must not be allowed to obtain the world’s most dangerous weapon. Its uranium enrichment facilities must be dismantled,” said Sa’ar at the Foreign Ministry."}

Now what?\nAnd then I thought about it, and perhaps everything’s ok.\nMaybe even better.\nBecause when non-Jews defend Jews, and (as I wrote in the post) society stands up to injustice and rectifies things, then we are seeing a society that is worthy and ready to receive and accept the Almighty’s kingship.\nThe verse that I quoted, (the last verse in Obadiah), talks about “saviours rising on the mountain of Zion.” It doesn’t say that those saviours need to be Jewish.\n(Interestingly, although numerous commentaries like Rashi, Eben Ezra, and Redak say that ‘saviours’ here refers to Moshiach and/or other Jewish personalities such as  the seven shepherds etc; nevertheless Abrabanel writes that it refers to non-Jews. Perhaps we can reconcile all these views, by using an explanation in Chassidus regarding seven shepherds etc. Namely, that the influence emanating from certain Jewish leaders inspires and motivates others to be saviours.)\nG-d has many messengers. They are championing ideals of justice and morality as taught from Zion; ideals that Jews throughout the centuries have shared, as a light to the nations.\nIncluding the seven Noahide laws which G-d told Moses, at Mount Sinai, to tell all nations.\nIndeed, there will come a time when the entire world will acknowledge G-d’s presence. “And the world will be filled with awareness of G-d, just as the waters cover the sea.” (Isaiah 11; 9)\nA time when the whole earth will be peaceful.\nPerhaps what we are seeing now, the many miracles that G-d is doing to protect His people, and the many efforts on the part of non-Jews to defend values of true morality, is a sign that Redemption with Moshiach is close.\nMay it happen very soon."}

The horrors of October 7th should have awakened a sense of clarity and solidarity. Instead, the aftermath has revealed just how fractured we’ve become.\nRather than rallying behind the Jewish state in a time of existential crisis, many in the American Jewish community—particularly younger and progressive segments—have turned against it; not to mention certain very visible Haredi sects as well.  Some are now among the most vocal critics at protests, on campuses, and across media platforms, aligning with groups that not only condemn Israeli policy but challenge Israel’s very right to exist.\nAt the same time, a strategic miscalculation is unfolding among more traditional and right-leaning Jews. Disillusioned with the left, they have sought refuge among populist conservatives, assuming that opposition to “wokeness” would translate to unwavering support for Israel. But we’ve overlooked something critical: the conservative populist movement is not defined by loyalty to allies—it is driven by an “America First” doctrine. And Israel is not America.\nTo that movement, US aid to Israel increasingly looks like a costly foreign entanglement — especially when the majority of American Jews consistently oppose their domestic agenda. They aren’t combing through voting patterns looking for the 30% of Jews who align with them. They’re looking at the whole and asking: Why invest political capital defending Israel when most American Jews vote against us on every other issue?\nThis is a real and growing sentiment, echoed by influential voices like Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens. Whether some dismiss them as antisemitic or not, the fact remains: they are shaping public opinion and drawing larger followings. To ignore them is to ignore a political reality that is shifting beneath our feet.\nEven Donald Trump — who many regard as Israel’s strongest modern ally — must be understood for who he is: a transactional actor. Yes, he moved the embassy to Jerusalem, brokered the Abraham Accords, and took a hard line on Iran. But if he sees an opportunity to secure a broader Middle East deal without Israel at the center, he’ll take it—especially if it plays well with voters and helps define his legacy.\nWe’ve seen the outlines of this already. The release of Edan Alexander — the last remaining American hostage in Gaza — was a huge humanitarian win for America and Israel. But it also means that the United States, from a political standpoint, no longer has the same urgency to stay deeply engaged in resolving the broader Israeli hostage crisis. The pressure has lessened. The cause, politically speaking, has been “checked off.”\nIsrael will have to continue that battle alone.\nThat’s the broader lesson here: Israel must learn to stand on its own. Not because America has abandoned it, but because no foreign power will fight another nation’s battles forever. Sovereignty means self-reliance. And American Jews must prepare for a reality in which US support is more conditional and less predictable.\nBut if we’re going to ask America to keep standing with Israel, we must also take responsibility for the divisions within our own community. Our internal fights — between secular and religious, progressive and traditional, Zionist and anti-Zionist — have left us scattered and weakened. The days when the American Jewish voice spoke with moral clarity and communal strength are fading.\nIt’s time to rebuild that foundation. That doesn’t mean suppressing disagreement—it means finding unity where it matters most: our safety, our values, and our future. And that means reckoning with how Israel’s war in Gaza is perceived globally. No matter how justified we believe the military actions to be, perception is reality. Without a defined endgame, prolonged conflict looks like aimless destruction—and the world is watching.\nNone of this means we abandon our Zionism. But we must be smart about how we express it. Supporting Israel can’t come at the expense of alienating the country we live in. We can advocate, donate, pray, and work to strengthen Israel—but we must also be invested in the health and unity of America, and its political future.\nOtherwise, we risk being politically homeless: too Zionist for the left, too progressive for the right, and increasingly distrusted by both.\nThis is the time for clarity. Israel needs to be strong. American Jews need to be smart. And all of us need to remember that the fight for Jewish survival has never just been about borders. It’s about identity, unity, and understanding the world as it is—not just as we wish it to be."}

Apart from wanting to see the destruction of Israel and the death of all Israelis and all Jews, they want the Palestinians lorded over by terrorists who oppress women and minorities of all types. The proof is that they reject any peace deal with Israel and support only violence against Israel, Israelis and Jews as the solution, while most of them claim to be the “peace” camp of the Left wing of the political spectrum. OG Hippies are rolling in their sleep.\nIsrael is in fact the most pro Palestine country. Maybe October 7, 2023 changed all of that. Maybe not. Time will tell. Nevertheless, the facts stand as they are. And the facts are:\n* Israel has done more for the establishment of a Palestinian state than any other nation on Earth.\n* Never mind the many peace offers that Israel made that the Palestinian leadership rejected over the decades. Israel signed the Declaration of Principles with the Palestinian Authority (PA) in 1993, giving the PA control of Area A, and joint control of Area B in Judea/Samaria.\n* Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005 and gave full control of it to the PA.\n* The only thing that makes Israel relent to recognize a full fledged Palestinian state is that Israel wants any state of Palestine to be one that is governed by a peaceful government that is not bent on Israel’s destruction. And to date, no leadership has emerged to represent the people that would be citizens of that future Palestinian state.\nMeanwhile, the useful idiots of the extreme Left, many (if not most) of whom are young adults, often in college in the U.S. or Europe, apparently just want something to do in between classes that’s maybe more interesting they scrolling through their echo chambered social media feeds. They have demonstrated that they stand for whatever trend blows in the wind. They stand against their own interests. They stand for cultures and ideologies that would smite them at the first opportunity. LGBTQIA+ for Palestine? Queers for Palestine? Gays for Palestine? Blacks for Palestine? Feminists for Palestine? Democrats for Palestine? All of them support Hamas and its terrorist and Islamist ways which would oppress them, beat them, torture them or kill them. They all claim to support Palestinians and want a “Free Palestine”. And they remain quiet whenever Israeli Arabs, let alone Palestinians, speak out or dare to protest against Hamas or the PA or other Palestinian groups at the forefront of the conflict.\nYet what would happen if these extreme Leftist self-described pro Palestinian protestors and activists got their way? Apart from the obvious fact that it would mean the destruction of Israel and the likely death of most if not all Israelis and Jews around the world, Hamas or another Islamist group or even the PA (which itself is hardly a bastion of liberalism despite being supposedly Socialist and anti Islamist on its surface) would probably rule Palestine in the most cruel ways imaginable, and deny all of them any rights. They stand for an Islamist caliphate that seeks world domination and the oppression of all those who do not hold their particular extremist religious and death cult views that seek the literal end of the world. The level of smooth brain is staggering among these extremist Left wingers who are usually quite ignorant about anything to do with the situation in Israel and Palestine.\nBy contrast, the young in Israel (Millennials and Gen Z) have proven that they are not the same smooth brained zombies. They stand up for what’s right. They show up for service and do their duty honorably, to protect their families, country, and values. They love life and they do their part to build and see a better world. Freedom and democracy have a beachhead in the Middle East. That place is Israel.\nLet’s refer to things as they really are\nGiven the current situation, it’s time to switch up the semantics and the narratives. It’s time to call out people who hate Israel, Jews and Palestinians and want them to be run by Hamas, the PA, the PIJ, etc. It’s time to call them what they are: Anti Israel, antisemitic and anti Palestinian.\nIt’s time to claim the pro Palestinian label for people that actually want to see the establishment of a peaceful Palestinian state (or at least are willing to accept it), as long as it lives side by side with Israel in peace, security, prosperity and with equal rights for all."}

(in https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/mishnah-tehillim-gd-and-our-now/). Accordingly, since my eclectic ideations (and definitions) are merely spontaneous declarative conjectures ⇒ For ANY & ALL Actual Life circumstances’ Decisions (mundane -or- critical), please discuss them (before, during, and-even after) with Your Rabbi! \nRelax: (…‘even’ if Your Rabbi just ‘wound up’ being a Rabbi for reason ‘apparently’ less-than ideal and/or even if Your Rabbi is so very tired of being a ‘social worker & family therapist’ rather than being able to focus ALL Life, Mind, Time efforts on Becoming an ever maturing Sifrei Kodesh enlightened Scholar) IF your Rabbi is (in any ‘Significant’ way) uncertain regarding what is Halacha’s ‘Best Life Practices Advice’ answer for Your Decision-Question (and/or your other ‘serious’ Life-relevant Practices-or-Belief ‘curiosities’), THEN your ‘issue’ will acquire share ‘responsibility’ with other (equal or greater) Rabbis, Teachers, and/or Relevant ‘Experts’ (such as Medical Doctors, Lawyers, Engineers, etc.); who in turn (as necessary) will ‘propagate’ your issue through Our almost-bidirectional Living Practical Rabbinic Wisdom Network – which is (forever) including The ‘Active Memory’ of Our Entire ‘Knowledge’ Base ⇒ until a Timely response to Your concerns is delivered to You -and- to any Active Beneficial Parties who may ‘require’ awareness of your situation (and –if helpful– including the Authorized Rabbinic Decision ‘Advice’ LEVEL).\nBehold: ALIVE, ‘atop’ the instant-present NOW’s Living portion of this Network, are Torah Giants: amazing awe-inspiring individuals. I used to ‘reasonably’ expect that their having internalized seeming endless intricacies of Hashkafa (‘preferred’ mutually-consistent metastable ‘sustainable survivability combinations’ of Torah & Halacha) should certainly cause their individual personalies to be ‘dissolved’ into the ‘Collective Ideation’ of the much (much) larger population of Our Sages (of Blessed Memory). Having been granted rare opportunities to meet, study, and ‘converse with’ (more than a few of) such awesome Scholarly Torah Masters, I am always continuously shocked to notice seemingly endless unique differences in their respective personality presentations, embracing authoritarian postures, analytical explication styles, etc. By comparison, we of virtually the same generation (certainly of the same Epoch) are the ones who are most identical to eachother; having only developed relatively minor shades of variations, nuances, and opinions. THUS, even for what WE might imagine to be the simple task ‘of identifying 613 Torat Moshe mitzvot’, Torah Giants come to respectively different criteria as to what is a Mitzvah (obligatory ‘Halacha’ instantiation of ‘Best Life Practices Advice’ → for Positive awareness & actions leading to increased realizations of greater success satisfaction -and- for Negative limits preventing degradation of decision criteria & eventual ‘autoimmune’ life-style intoxication) -and- what is a Hechsher Mitzvah (necessary preparation to perform a Mitzvah). Easily to appreciate Hecher Mitzvah examples include: Baking Matzah in order to be able to perform the mitzvah of Eating Matzah (on Pesach) -and- Building a Sukkah in order to perform the mitzvah of Sitting in a Sukkah (during that festival). \nIncidentally: I recall “GaOwn HaDoor” Aharon Chaim HaLevi Zimmerman A”H explaining a forever thereafter obvious example of a ‘plain obvious’ Torat Moshe Mitzvah that is NOT among TaRYaG – being the Sinai-Generation’s limitations & obligations regarding collecting & eating Manna (Historically: weekday edible morning ‘dew’ condensate – during Our collective national ‘ancient traversal’ from Egypt to Israel); since a Torat Moshe Status Mitzvah must be for All Time, while ‘mitzvah’ details regarding The Manna were only for that generation. NOTE: It is impossible for me to guess if this ‘example’ was Rav Zimmerman’s or from idunno → since he had such astoundingly enormous erudition that I only once heard him answer a question (mine?) in the first person; and Everywhere Else he ‘just’ called for one of the thousands of Authoritative Halacha Commentary books (in his home – where I usually listened to his real-time ‘public’ learning), turned to the appropriate page (which he ‘also’ knew from memory), and read That Author’s answer to that questioner’s query. Nevertheless, having observed his ‘Instant Responsa’ style, I strongly suspect that he knew numerous possible answers to each question, and then consciously picked one that ALSO resonated with ‘inner motivational issues’ of whoever asked the question (probably? Mine Too!). I have also been told (by people witnessing) stories of him pouring out countless explicit quotes (from innumerable ‘famous’ and more-obscure authoritative Halacha sources) during interactive ‘discussions’ with other Torah Giants; until they respectfully (publicly) resigned themselves as (politely) → needing to go back – to re-study whatever issue in greater depth ⇒ having obviously appreciated their respective ‘lack’ of substantial Torah/Halacha prior study & consideration (Compared to His).\nReturning to TaRYaG → It may be that this ‘613’ number (of Torat Moshe mitzvot) was derived from (awakening considerations of) oblique Aggadah subtleties (allegorical ‘expressions’ – hinting at some esoteric-or-delicate Life appreciation-or-cautionary aspect); which eventually ‘migrated’ into (performative) Halacha reasoning; nevertheless, it is established Halacha today -and- Status differentiation is an extremely necessary aspect used for resolving comparative classification ‘Levels of Strictness’ and ‘Dissonance Resolution Protocols’ between (and among) ‘basic’ Torat Moshe mitzvot, assorted ‘strata’ of Rabininc injunctions, and spurious ‘established’ Minhagim (customs & enhancements).\nFor example, the other day – I actually (privately) ‘disagreed’ with Our (local synagogue’s) Exceedingly Scholarly Rav’s interesting discourse: a juxtaposition of Sefirat HaOmer as either being one of these original TaRYaG -or- being a Rabbinic ‘injunction’; since by my haphazard reckoning, this ‘counting’ seems to be either: neither -or- both! My unauthorized & uncertified ‘suspicion’ is that this daily numeration is ‘more’ of a Hechsher Mitzvah (another example: a necessary preparation for ‘Actually’ Bringing THE Omer – Mitzvah performed on Shavuot) which, by becoming a custom (even in the Tanakh era), has taken on a Status: at least equal to a Rabbinic ‘commandment’; thus neither (it is a Hechsher Mitzvah) -or- both (it is one of TaRYaG -and- by virtue of TaRYaG doubt → also a Rabbinic injunction). In that my Halacha Status ‘conjecture’ had no instant significance to any ongoing situation, I guess that my ‘neither -or- both’ perception will ‘just – sort of’ percolate around and/or through The Network (until an authoritative source is found – that already discussed my indeterminacy).\n[OFFICIAL NOTICE: I am NOT (?nor have I ever been?) a voting member of Our virtual trans-generational Halacha Decision Making ‘forum’; nor do I aspire to such Responsibility.]\n613 Prime\nMeandering onward, my thoughts (these days) wandered far (FAR) away from Halacha Status assignments, by simply noticing that 613 is a Prime Number; and here begins my perhaps Torah-Irrelevant musings: \nBackground: Having given rise to counting & arithmetic, perhaps The Oldest ‘Branch’ of Mathematics is ‘Number Theory’, which ‘eventually’ began to ‘explore’ Prime Numbers; an ‘intellectual curiosity’ that Already had a place in Paleolithic quantitative research (apparently – but not definitively) evidenced from Palaeolithic ‘tally sticks’ – like the Ishango Bone. Later, but still Before the Bronze Age, ‘Number Theory’ gave rise to the Decimal System (in India and in China); likewise, Early Bronze Age hieroglyphs ‘portray’ its use in Egypt. The Decimal System led to invention & development of the ‘Abacus’ (analog computer), while other computational systems & machines (way Way WAY back then) included an Antikythera mechanism, earlier sexagenary cycle Chinese Lunisolar calendar, much earlier Sumerian & Babylonian Sexagesimal ‘tables’ (for ‘rapid’ computation), respective prior-art mathematics (referenced in Bakhshali manuscript), etc.; all contributing to considerations included in today’s digital-electronic & q-bit quasi-analog ‘computers’ (and – just as always – in assorted philosophical & pseudo-mystical speculations).\n⇒ Now, having NO special Torah/Mitzvot significance whatsoever (that I am aware of) – but maybe being a thought-experiment curiosity regarding some pre-ancient antecedents of ‘Number Theory’ ⇒ Just for Fun (while ‘trying to think’ as a math student might have during ‘Matan Torah’ times – middle Bronze Age): ‘613’ is the start of a beautiful ‘Enigma’ – perhaps even the answer to an entrance interview question → given to an applicant for study in a Bronze Age ‘Pure Mathematics’ Department. \nPatience: Details of an ‘After #613 Enigma’ are given later on (before the still-distant Postscript).\nA FIRST (perhaps only) ‘answer’ for this Beautiful ‘Enigma’ resides within convergent properties based upon sequential prime triplets (7, 11, 13) ⇒ since 613 is the seventh prime having adjacent prime number digit-pair “13” (13, 113, 131, 137, 139, 313, 613) → Thus a 7 → 13 relationship -AND- given that digits 6+1+3=10 → 613 is also the thirteenth prime having digits that add up to “10” (19, 37, 73, 109, 127, 163, 181, 271, 307, 433, 523, 541, 613). \n⇒ (incidentally) ALL ‘this’ seems to vaguely resemble A Very Long ‘Series’ of later mathematics ‘Enigma’ observations, conjectures, theorems, and proofs – about bounding, patterning, and searching for Prime Numbers; such as Eratosthenes Sieve, Klauber Triangle, Ulam spiral, Sacks spiral, …, Yitang Zhang’s Theorem; AND many (quite recent) Lucrative Applications; such as for Data-Set Hashing & Compression, Public-Key Cryptography (for Internet & Online Transaction Security), Error-Correcting Codes, Imaging Processing, https://patents.google.com/?q=(%22prime+numbers%22)&oq=%22prime+numbers%22&clustered=true, and SETI(??$?). \nCaution: Numerical Enigmas, Riddles, Puzzles, and Problems ‘often’ distract us from ‘more significant’ (?) matters.\nAnyway: WHEN you are ‘trying’ To Teach Torah/Mitzvot, and too many students are lost or losing interest or looking “outside”, THEN maybe stop – AND let all of your students contemplate, search for, discover, and discuss ALL kinds of other interesting (to them) “non-random” quantities, units, measurements, dimensions, and relationships in Torat Moshe, etc. Freely exploring mathematical reasoning is GOOD for young minds, a necessary diversion from other (highly important – albeit typically ‘more’ qualitative logic) Halacha subjects, and actually prepares students to engage in mathematical-type reasoning found in various Mishnah Tractates, etc. – which seem to have ‘fallen out’ from (most) Yeshivah studies. [B”H …still hoping to post a listing of such examples in a future Blog.] \nTODAY: “Random Number Generation” Algorithms remain an unsolved problem, even when merged with streaming ‘ever changing’ physical sensor measurements of ‘cosmic background noise’; thus, (incidentally) also a ‘curious’ problem for all current Quantum Computing ‘q-bit machines’ ⇒ which brings us to another ongoing (Halacha Irrelevant?) clash of ideation: where Prime numbers have NOT been proven to be Random – NOR have they been proven to be Predictable. Actually, while lots of observable world measurements seem to have predictable aspects (indicating causal relationships), many (many) more are apparently intractable to separation of variables (sufficient to ‘appear’ Less Than random); IF in fact there is such a thing as Random? Well, at least that last interrogatory-ending (Actually) sentence is a curt capsule summary of (quasi-recursive Processes in) The History of Science; engaging in an ongoing ‘battle’ (to discover Predictable boundary value perturbation functions in Isolated Systems) ⇒ to breach ‘invisible ramparts’ of Observable Computational Complexity (NP-complete, NP-hard, etc. – yes – there will be more!). \nSeriously: What is Random, is there such a ‘thing’ as Random, why should there be any Random anything; since that would indicate an exception to causality. Feels like a reincarnation ‘analogy’ to ‘Super-Natural’ (transcendent? manifestations?) – which is ‘just’ another example illustrating unwillingness to accept that we are not All Knowing (not even close)! Even OUR respect for ‘miracles’ appreciates that these rare (unique – ‘probably’ once in the ‘history’ of the ‘universe’) occurrences are happenings in a ‘right place’ and in a ‘right moment’ – for an individual – thus very much more so when they ‘pop up’ for an entire Nation (Israel’s spectacular Moshe-led dry-escape sea-thru exit, etc.). Implicitly, ‘miracles’ are nevertheless somehow built into Nature’s ‘fabric’ → with all ‘other’ observed or evidentiary instances being classified as ‘unique’ Natural phenomena (meaning not ‘yet’ sufficiently reproducible → to be adapted as a technology). \nOUR entire Belief ‘system’ (every aspect of it) is based upon an acceptance of Causality (in the ‘simpler’ external active world of Nature) -AND- that a majority of personal ‘Reward & Retribution’ resides in Our having to Live with Ourselves ⇒ I celebrate my feeling alive according to how much GOOD I have found opportunity to accomplish -and- I suffer my feeling alive according to how much ‘wrong’ I have consciously chosen to enact. Likewise, as a Nation → Our joys & celebrations are the result of Our (sometimes paltry) mitzvot AND to a much (Much) greater extent upon the Merits of Our Ancestors; while Our sorrows & tragedies are neither ‘punishments’ nor the (direct) result of Our ‘sins’ and/or/nor the ‘sins’ of Our Ancestors ⇒ by reason that the complexity of causality in the mind (inclusive of education) spans more than the instant present now of external ‘action & reaction’ Nature. (see https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/silent-mind-inner-voice/ – where iterative Mature analysis -and- often appropriate Rejection of ‘victim guilt’ are discussed)\nModestly stated: There are TWO different ‘time’ scales: One TIME is a ‘mostly’ external ‘f(t)’ time in Nature – which includes both Laws of direct causality which have been discovered & parameterized -and- higher complexity ‘systems’ which have not – and perhaps never will be – reduced to separable simultaneous f(t) causality topologies; and The Other TIME is a ‘mostly’ internal ‘m(t)’ time in the mind – which include cumulative adaptive convolutions of gestation, experience, and education; ‘traditions’ of thought & action, prior knowledge & understanding, cumulative relevance & renewal; etc. ⇒ THUS two ‘partially’ Intersecting types of ‘TIME’ -and- of Interacting ‘causality’. (Further discussion – in the Postscript) \nFinally (in this moment), for those interested in breaking a chicken-and-egg entanglement-loop between Neurobiology and Information Science (each ‘inventively’ borrowering a next explanation-model from the other), here is a ‘crack’ in the shell of that incestual academic cycle. Neurobiology (today) is an explosion of research-derived knowledge (EEG, MRI, synapse, myelination, etc.) – which try to ‘intertwine’ our totally over-simplified models of macro-meso scale ‘systems’ (of thought & action) -with- our attempts to scale up our clinical observation of ongoing mini-micro scale electrochemical & hormonal events (localized) in ‘fragments’ of those ‘systems’. Simplified: Input-Process-Output in macro-empirical Neurobiology (trying to ‘grasp’ thought and/or consciousness) always has a large complexity-awesome topological bulge at ‘Process’ (the Brain is BIG -and- the rest of that same organism’s Neuroanatomy is comparatively tiny) – while technological (computer systems – including AI) Information Science always is ‘struggling’ with a respective bottle-neck (constriction) at ‘Process’ ⇒ Giant Hyperscale (Extra-Terrestrial Size) Data Processor ‘Clouds’ are never big enough. (Enough ‘here’ – for those of-this-now who need to understand.)\n[After a long pause] Guessing that last long paragraph (of I don’t know, we don’t know, and it might be of too great a complexity to ‘ever’ be knowable) should HELP transport us on a return to honest humility & stability; to do some serious work on Our respective Middot (ethical empathetic personality traits -and- ‘appropriate’ associated speech-or-silence, action-or-restraint, etc.); to solicit, discuss, contemplate, and accept constructive criticism; to continue Our Torah ‘enlightenment’ appreciation progress; etc. -or- (well → ‘and/or’) to Introspectively Contemplate examples, orientations, and suggestions in The Siddur* (and ‘elsewhere’ in Sifrei Kodesh) as much more than the easier (for some) inclination to ‘review’ (recite) these texts as being directed ‘G?D?

Professionally, interviewing inventors and researching inventions, I have been blessed to contemplate this problem; one ‘specific’ example at a time -and- to occasionally wonder about ‘innovation’. While the vast majority of inventions seems to derive from a confluence of [m(t)*m(t) -or- m(t)*f(t)] ‘internal’ ideations (even when ‘sparked’ by a happenstantial observation of an object, interaction, or process of Nature), they apparently are evidence of a sudden shift ‘event’ where the mind experiences an alternate expectation awareness moment (or an initiated sequence of implications), and is active enough to preserve & expand that ‘surprise’ exemplary convolution (in some ‘simplified’ articulate or graphic or musical or topological or emotional form).\nThus, regarding differentiation of two kinds of ‘time’ (described above), specifically when looking at Nature’s (apparently ongoing instant now) time: f(t) compared to the Mind’s (potentially integral with prior minds’) time: m(t), I wondered if this is a NEW idea; and an answer is (at least) ‘not exactly’ – since this resembles an ‘inspired’ anthropomorphic transformation of a (greatly simplified) String Theory model → wherein a macro-dimension f(t) – has ‘attached’ a ‘curled up’ nano-dimension m(t) ⇒ apparently having different scales of interactions between an m(t) plurality (of thoughts) than those between m(t) & f(t) (mind with matter interactions). Likewise, just as entanglement among an m(t) plurality seems not guaranteed to be ‘forever’ (apparently, over multi-millennia, being both subsumed and/or having a sort of half-life – albeit with an astounding speed of propagation), I expect that (theoretical & experimental) subsumption, half-life, and propagation will also prove to be the case for quantum entanglement in the f(t) domain; among many other ‘forthcoming’ alterations & modifications to ALL ongoing (ever too complex) over-simplified conceptualization-limited Models of Nature: Life, Mind, and Time.\nOf course, some-or-many qualitative thinkers (philosophers, poets, ‘psychologists’, preachers, etc.) will invert this to be: m(t): a macro-dimension -and- f(t): a ‘curled up’ nano-dimension (Mind ‘over’ Matter); however I hope that all ‘at least’ agree to delicate asymmetry — when comparing interactions between an m(t) plurality -and- those between f(t) and m(t) — even though there is still not more than a fragile consensus regarding ‘invariance’ interactions between an f(t) plurality; inclusive of ‘apparent’ ever emerging ‘parity violation’ experimental evidence → which seems to eventually lead to yet another more modern ‘next level’ conservation of something model, etc.\nAnyway, this Postscript is ‘just’ another kind of distraction; since (thus far) day-to-day’s worst case scenario [Mishnah Avot 4.1] is that we at least have Free-Will To Choose: Being happy with Our (personal) portion ⇒ and it seems that A Better than worst-case scenario is often possible too! \nAbstracted: OUR unModern generation’s Reflexively asymmetric 613 Prime dissonant ideas reflect millennia quasi-invariance. Distilled: (Literally compressing Kübler-Ross models into a single aspect) ‘Acceptance’ is a necessary base-line of human experience – specifically Acceptance of Halacha Status according to a majority of Our Sages (indicating no disagreement opinions regarding f(t) factual Existence). Thus, Our ‘Best Life Practices Advice’ ongoing m(t) protocol (The Halacha) consists of a long-life repeating series of ‘Acceptance’ steps; EACH affirmatively (always) electively-entangled with ‘Gratitude’ (in every waking moment of consciousness) for having been given The m(t) Gift of being Alive.\n (→ generated Manually)  DATA  (>Please< comment: if there is an Error!)\n(3,5,7) ⇒ 3rd with embedded 7 is 37 [7, 17, 37] which is the 2nd Prime with digits sum 10 [19, 37]\n(5,7,11) ⇒ 5th with embedded 11 is 811 [11, 113, 211, 311, 811] which is the 15th Prime with digits sum 10 [19, 37, 73, 109, 127, 163, 181, 271, 307, 433, 523, 541, 613, 631, 811]\n(7,11,13) ⇒ 7th with embedded 13 is 613 [(13, 113, 131, 137, 139, 313, 613)] which is the 13th Prime with digits sum 10 [19, 37, 73, 109, 127, 163, 181, 271, 307, 433, 523, 541, 613]\n(11,13,17) ⇒ 11th with embedded 17 is 1723 [17, 173, 179, 317, 617, 1117, 1171, 1217, 1709, 1721, 1723] which is the 26th Prime with digits sum 13 [139, 157, 193, 229, 283, 337, 373, 409, 463, 571, 643, 661, 733, 751, 823, 1093, 1129, 1237, 1291, 1327, 1381, 1453, 1471, 1543, 1721, 1723]\n(13,17,19) ⇒ 13th with embedded 19 is 1619 [19, 191, 193, 197, 199, 419, 619, 719, 919, 1019. 1193, 1319, 1619] which is the 24th Prime with digits sum 17 [179, 197, 269, 359, 449, 467, 557, 647, 683, 719, 773, 809, 827, 863, 953, 971, 1097, 1187, 1259, 1277, 1367, 1439, 1583, 1619]\n(17,19,23) ⇒ 17th with embedded 23 is 2309 [23, 223, 233, 239, 523, 823, 1123, 1223, 1231, 1237, 1423, 1523, 1723, 1823, 2237, 2239, 2309] which is the 36th Prime with digits sum 14 [59, 149, 167, 293, 347, 383, 419, 491, 509, 563, 617, 653, 743, 761, 941, 1049, 1193, 1229, 1283, 1319, 1373, 1409, 1427, 1481, 1553, 1571, 1607, 1733, 1823, 1913, 1931, 2039, 2129, 2237, 2273, 2309]"}

So far, in recent times the contest has been politically affected by the following:\nContinuing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the late 2000s.\nThe 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas.\nThe aftermath of the Russo-Georgian War.\nAnd then we have Israel’s involvement in the Eurovision…\nIn 1973, Israel became the first country from outside of Europe to enter the Eurovision. Impressive! It has remained a regular competitor in the contest and been crowned winner on four occasions.\nThe Eurovision was regularly broadcast in the Arab world during the 1970s. But in 1978 changes happened. When it became apparent that Israel was on course to win, the Jordanian broadcaster JTV hastily ended its transmission… due to “technical difficulties”.  (1)\nMany Eurovision-eligible Arab states choose not to enter because of Israel’s presence. Perhaps Koranic cultural deficit hampers song-writing abilities in those countries? Or is the real reason for abstention because the mullahs state that music is ‘haram‘ (forbidden)? (2)\nThose absentions are hardly due to petty political pique and point-scoring, are they??\nWhat are the idealistic aims of the Eurovision?\nEvery May, many millions of viewers  watch Eurovision. Some people groan at the banal bubblegum lyrics; others gasp at the outrageous costumes. Social media evolves with many memes, nerds learn about contestants and express opinions of the asinine songs.\nBut where and how did it all start? After World War 2, some European countries wanted to collaborate together, leading to the beginning of the European Broadcasting Union in 1950. For sixty years Eurovision has featured 1,500 songs, spanning many different genres, sung in a polyglot panoply. Ireland has won Eurovision seven times.\nThat impressive cache of Irish prizes will get soon overclouded, replaced in the public consciousness by yet more unaesthetic antisemitism. A few small demonstrations organised by the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign (ISPC) have happened outside the headquarters of RTE, the Irish national broadcaster.\nThe IPSC’s wooden-worded, campaign rallying cry claims that: ‘RTÉ is allowing itself, and by extension all TV license payers, to be used to bolster Israel’s art-washing propaganda machine as it continues its genocidal assault on the Palestinian people.’ (3)\nThis kind of stifling censorship is particularly ironic to Irish Jews (as well as the minority of open-minded intelligentsia). The pungent pro-Palestinian people who support Kneecap seem to be the same “anti-Zionists” who are calling to ban Israel’s Yuval Raphael from Eurovision 2025. Hypocritical double standards when push comes to shove!\n“Unity Shapes Love”- is the 2025 Eurovision banner theme.\nThat aspirational theme belies the simmering tensions behind the scenes as several broadcasters. RTÉ, Spain’s RTVE and Slovenia’s RTV are asking for a debate on Israel’s involvement in the festival. However, the EBU’s position has always been that it is an association of broadcasters, not governments. Kan TV (in Israel) has a right to take part.’ (4)\nIn similar cultural censorship news, last week Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood and Dudu Tassa blamed threats from pro-Palestinian activists for the cancellation of their upcoming UK shows.“Intimidating venues into pulling our shows won’t help achieve the peace and justice everyone in the Middle East deserves.” (5)\nAs the late-great liberal Jewish journalist, Nat Hentoff, once said: “Free Speech for me for not for Thee…”\nIn one of King David’s ancient songs, which no doubt would be censored if entered into Eurovision heats, he confidently states that:\nGod is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.

We must hope that Trump comprehends the implications and remains unaffected by Netanyahu’s allies in Washington.\nThree countries that Trump will not visit influence the trip – China, Iran, and Israel. The goal of preventing China’s influence in the region is a bipartisan objective in the U.S. and one of the reasons why the Biden administration has dramatically changed its stance toward Crown Prince MBS from hostility to an attempt to upgrade bilateral relations.\nThe U.S. negotiations with Iran also influence the visit due to the need to coordinate with the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) on the U.S. demands from Iran, as the October deadline for the possibility of snapback sanctions approaches. Contrary to the spin spread by the right in Israel, the Sunni countries in the Gulf are interested in a U.S. agreement with Iran and are very concerned about an Israeli or American attack that could lead to a war that would severely impact them.\nEnding the war with a deal that will release the hostages is in the interest of the three countries Trump will visit – Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates – and it is also an immediate and clear Israeli interest. Netanyahu might argue that the threats of intensified IDF action in Gaza led to Hamas’s capitulation; however, it is evident that the key to the deal lies in Jerusalem and depends on Trump’s pressure on Netanyahu, which is essential for the visit’s success.\nPromoting the normalization of Saudi Arabia and, along with it, most of the Sunni Muslim world with Israel, and including additional countries, especially Saudi Arabia, in the Abraham Accords is a crucial goal, but very difficult to achieve due to the current government in Israel. Fortunately, today the fantasies of another bypass of the Palestinians, as was the case with the Abraham Accords, cannot materialize, given the clear stance of all the countries in the region, whose citizens watch Al Arabiya or Al Jazeera daily for the horrors from Gaza and cannot ignore the Palestinians.\nThe main goal of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the Emirates is to upgrade their bilateral relations with the U.S. economically and security-wise, and Trump sees these three wealthy countries as potential for economic improvement, which will help him advance his domestic American agenda, especially in light of the crisis that arose after the tariff announcements.\nTrump is mainly interested in business and the fame that would bring him closer to the Nobel Peace Prize, which he thought he deserved after signing the Abraham Accords. In bilateral aspects, it seems there is a high chance of announcements regarding investments and technological collaborations that are beneficial for both sides.\nRegarding fame, it is difficult to evaluate, but there are certainly actions Trump can take that would benefit him while also supporting Israel’s interests in regional integration and the advancement of the two-state vision.\nRiad is interested in a civil nuclear cooperation agreement, the details of which seem to have mostly been finalized, but it requires sufficient support in Congress to prevent a vote against the agreement according to the rules in the U.S. Atomic Energy Act Section 123 regarding nuclear cooperation. Saudi Arabia is also interested in purchasing weapons systems and munitions, and Trump would be pleased with sales that are beneficial for the American economy. Saudi Arabia is also interested in an American commitment to its security, but the chances of securing the 67 votes needed in the Senate to approve a defense alliance without an Israeli and Palestinian component are not high, so they might settle for less.\nIn order to overcome the fact that Netanyahu’s government is unable to provide any political horizon for the Palestinians that would satisfy Saudi Arabia, Trump could announce American recognition of a Palestinian state and a willingness to change American laws that prevent UN aid if Palestine is recognized as a member state and that prevent bilateral American aid to the Palestinian Authority. Such a move could enable Saudi Arabia to take steps toward normalization and dramatically influence Israeli and Palestinian public opinion to support a two-state solution within a regional alliance.\nDoha already has significant security relations with the U.S. Qatar hosts the largest U.S. base in the region and has the status of a Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA). Beyond Qatari investments in the U.S., it is important for Trump to use the visit to enlist Qatar’s help in establishing a Palestinian technocratic government to replace Hamas in Gaza. It is important that Qatar leverage its influence over Hamas not only in the context of the hostage deal but also regarding the day after the ceasefire, when Hamas will not be in control but will still impact the future of the Strip and the future of the arrangement.\nThe Qataris will certainly try to influence Trump to prevent Israel from continuing to sow discord between them and Egypt in a way that harms the hostage deal and also the reality in Gaza after the fighting, where Qatari and Egyptian coordination is of great importance.\nIn Abu Dhabi, there is immense economic potential for the USA and for the Emiratis in terms of access to American technologies, especially in the field of AI. The Emiratis, who took pride in the Abraham Accords for preventing de jure annexation, as planned by Netanyahu and the then-American ambassador Friedman, need to send a clear message that they oppose de facto annexation, which is happening in the West Bank on steroids.\nThe Emiratis have no influence over Hamas but a lot of potential to influence Fatah and support the secular opposition to Abbas. The Emiratis can influence who will head the Palestinian technocrat government, as they have prevented any involvement from Abbas and his people so far, and they must be part of the agreements regarding the demands from the Palestinian Authority to support the move.\nThe three countries expect Trump to persuade Israel to avoid actions that could jeopardize the positive changes they perceive in the diminishing Iranian influence in Lebanon and Syria. It is crucial for them to clarify their expectation that Trump will facilitate the establishment of a Palestinian state, which aligns with clear Zionist interests.\nAs usual, in Trump’s case, it’s very difficult to predict what he will do, but there is definitely potential for a positive regional shift if Trump frees himself from the influence of the hawks and Netanyahu’s allies in American politics.\n "}

Last week, he and a guest discussed a phenomenon that is hard for many of us to comprehend–why seemingly educated Americans side with Palestinian Arab terrorists against Israel and, even more puzzling, make excuses for the barbaric excesses of those terrorists.  Their discussion is fascinating, illuminating, and depressing.\nI urge you to find it and listen to it (“Think Twice” Podcast with Jonathan Tobin and Uri Kaufman).  I will just provide a few highlights, because, as you will see, the discussion led me in an entirely different direction.\nThey maintain that the progressives who have taken over culture and education in America have conditioned and indoctrinated an entire generation to see the conflict in the Middle East through the prism of race relations, with Israelis viewed as white oppressors and Palestinians as down-trodden blacks, with various similar, and similarly erroneous, constructs emerging (e.g., European settlers and Native Americans or, in a particularly disturbing inversion, Nazis and Jews, with the Israelis being the Nazis). Blinded to every fact about Palestinians and the events of October 7, all they can see is a distorted vision of the  privileged abusing the disadvantaged.  Kaufman blames all the usual suspects for the vilification of Israel:  Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama, Tom Friedman and “so-called human rights groups” like Amnesty International.  In this scenario, the Palestinians, as victims, will always be blameless, no matter how intransigent, brutal, violent, rejectionist, and deviant.\nThe podcast was persuasive and explained the troubling, almost inexplicable, images of enlightened students supporting rapists and kidnappers, sensitive idealists tearing down posters of kidnapped babies, gays closing their eyes to the oppressive nature of the Islamist credo, and educated observers denying facts and history in favor of a distorted narrative.\nAnd I kept thinking, “That explains the Democrat Party and the teachers unions and the brainwashed students, but what about the Jews?  Why are there so many Jews in the ranks of the opponents of Israel and Zionism? Why don’t we Jews, with our long history of persecution, know better? Would any other ethnic or religious group be persuaded by this sort of cultural current to betray their nature and their people, to side with savages who want to exterminate their brethren?  Can Barack Obama and intersectionality so easily overcome the filial and fraternal loyalties of the People of Israel?\nAnd when the campus unrest and urban demonstrations incorporate open and blatant anti-semitism, what explains the fact that some Jewish organizations are ready to man the barricades and lead the struggle against efforts to oppose the anti-Jewish behavior?  Would the NAACP support the KKK?\nNothing that Tobin and Kaufman say explains the fact that Jews seem to be playing such a prominent role in the “resistance,” acting as spokesmen for the campus insurrectionists, chaining themselves to gates of universities, brazenly wearing Jewish symbols and signs proclaiming their Jewishness and their alienation from the Jewish State. \nI understand the rationalization for the behavior and beliefs of a Gentile generation that has been indoctrinated in woke, intersectional anti-Semitism.  But what failures in Jewish upbringing, education, and experience account for the mindless perfidy of the cohorts of the  “As a Jew,” “Not in My Name,” and “Jewish Voice For Peace”?  And what could possibly explain the vociferous opposition of the Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist movements to a crackdown on anti-semitic activities and their non-citizen participants?  Why do efforts to protect Jews on campus make these organizations feel “less safe”?  Is it even conceivable that if women, blacks, or gays were being assaulted and abused on campus that the Union for Reform Judaism, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, the National Council of Jewish Women, the American Conference of Cantors, HIAS, the Rabbinical Assembly (Conservative), the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, and the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association (not to meention affinity groups for women, blacks, or gays) could so quickly band together to oppose efforts to protect them?\nWe can’t blame that on Barack Obama, or the teachers’ unions, or Jimmy Carter, or Tom Friedman.\nWhat is wrong with us?  What is to blame?\nTikkun Olam. Repairing the world.\nThis manufactured substitute for authentic Judaism has eaten away at the fabric of Jewish community and Jewish solidarity.  Where Judaism asserts the special mission of the Jewish people in its homeland, Tikkun Olam defines Judaism down to the most anodyne, tedious, pareve ethical culture, so inclusive in its concern for everyone and everything that any individual identity or loyalty is impossible.  When the liberal Jewish establishment gave up on God and Jewish practices and Jewish law, the substitute it chose–Tikkun Olam–authorized a wholesale rejection of everything that Judaism has represented.  The bastardization of this liturgical and Talmudic concept in progressive Jewish movements is the force that has mainstreamed Jewish rejection of Israel and Judaism itself.\nDon’t get me wrong.  Tikkun Olam is a beautiful thing, even in its watered-down version.  We should all be trying to make the world a better place.  But Tikkun Olam is not Judaism nor an adequate substitute for Judaism.  And the fact that it has been mislabeled to two generations of liberal Jews as the sine qua non of the Jewish faith has been catastrophically destructive.\nClassically, there are three authentic definitions of “Tikkun Olam,” none of which fits the definition ascribed by those who have co-opted it to represent whatever social justice movement  catches their fancy.\nIn the liturgy, it is used once in the Aleinu prayer–לתקן עולם במלכות שדי–to perfect the world under the sovereignty of the Almighty.  In this prayer, the perfection of the world is to be accomplished by God, not environmentalists or social justice warriors.  The prayer speaks of our duty to praise God who is the author of all creation, who has not made us like the nations of the lands . . . for they worship vanity and emptiness and pray to one who can not save.  But we bow in worship and thank the supreme King of kings . . .who, we anticipate, will perfect the world.\nNo one who invokes Tikkun Olam as a reason to espouse a political or social ideology ever invokes the sovereignty of the Almighty. It is a movement based on misinterpretation of a fragment of a thought, an incomplete half of a phrase.\nIn the Talmud, Tikkun Olam does not mean fixing the world, but applying Rabbinic flexibility as a corrective to situations in which a mindless adherence to the law might yield a result that is harmful to society. For example, one who sends a messenger to act on his behalf in delivering a divorce document was empowered to annul it in a way that might not have come to the attention of the messenger, who then might deliver it, creating a situation in which a married woman might think she was free to marry someone else.  This possibility was foreclosed, because of Tikkun Olam–the improvement of the world–because a world in which a woman could mistakenly have illegitimate children needed a remedy. So the Rabbis improved the world by rendering that scenario impossible.\nSimilarly, when the Rabbis saw that lenders were refraining from lending money to those in need as the shemitah year–in which loans were automatically forgiven–approached, they created a process known as prozbol, in which the loan was assigned to the court; debt repayment to the court was not excused in the shemitah year.  Thus loans would continue to be made to needy people, enabled by an amendment to the law motivated by Tikkun Olam.\nIn Kabbalah, Tikkun Olam is seen as repairing the rift between God and the exiled Shekhinah through the performance of mitzvot.  I will not elaborate here, but trust me that it has nothing to do with gay rights, BLM, fossil fuels, free range chicken, or free Palestine.\nNote that all the examples deal with highly particularized situations of the Jewish community, not attempts to recreate the world.\nSadly, when the burden of the rules and laws and culture that sustained Judaism became too onerous for a Jewish community that just wanted to be like their friends in the Democrat Party, the forward-thinking leaders of their movements came up with the feel good concept of adapting a totally inapposite Jewish principle–Tikkun Olam–as a stand-in for pretty much everything that gave shape and meaning to Jewish life.  You don’t want to observe the Sabbath?  Fine, as long as you oppose fracking.  Inter-marriage appealing? No problem, but help us repair the world by getting religion out of the public square, ending racial discrimination, and, perhaps, freeing Palestine.  The best way to be a good Jew is to simply be a good person.  Just like everyone else.\nWhen the Romans initially rejected Christian theology, as represented by the portion of Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount to the effect that he did not intend to change jot nor tittle of Moses’ law, Paul “saved” Christianity by redefining it, explaining that circumcision of the heart could replace circumcision of the flesh.  He “democratized” Judaism and defined it right out of existence.  Those cumbersome rules could be shunted aside; all you needed to do to achieve salvation was believe in Jesus. The marketing was extraordinarily effective. \nSo it was with Tikkun Olam.  The concept was no less pervasive and, initially, equally as successful.  It became the cornerstone of liberal, progressive Judaism.  It was so successful that it nearly obliterated any trace of authentic Judaism from the groups that adopted it as their lodestar.  It is only half a joke that Judaism was transformed into the Democrat Party with holidays.\nAll that is required is to be a citizen of the world and try to make it better.  As citizens of the world charged with fixing it, we have no special allegiance to our people or any people.  HIAS, once for displaced Jews, took the world for its constituency. Jews must support unlimited access at the border, because we are for Tikkun Olam.  We must bleed for the downtrodden Palestinians, irrespective of their sordid behavior.  The woke Rabbis must prefer freedom of speech for insurrectionists over protection for Jewish students.  It would be beneath us to take sides by favoring the people of our faith.  On the contrary, we will bend over backwards to accommodate those who hate us.  We are repairing the world.\nRight into oblivion.\nOf course being Jewish should mean being good. But being good does not necessarily mean being Jewish. Being Jewish should mean living an ethical, moral, charitable life, but none of those activities make you Jewish. They are necessary but not sufficient.\nJudaism is more than that. And for those for whom Judaism is not more, it will, as is easily apparent, be diminished to the point of invisibility."}

By chance, my festival was located in Shittim, a small southern community one hour north of Eilat, and not the Nova festival at Kibbutz Re’im in which over 360 concert-goers were murdered and dozens more taken captive. As I corresponded with my editor, trying to understand the gravity of the situation, I heard the sobs of others around me desperately trying to reach parents who lived in the Gaza envelope and others besides themselves with worry for friends who were already considered “missing” from the Nova festival.\nIn the months that followed, as I embarked upon my first full-time journalistic position covering Israel at war, I would often think about the mysterious workings of fate – why I woke up in a tent surrounded by panic but not terror, while peers of mine woke to gunfire and death. This arbitrary fortune haunted me throughout my reporting on the war that followed and to the present day.\nDocumenting horror: The trauma behind the byline\nTwo weeks after the attack, a nation – and me with it – reeling in shock, I found myself in a military auditorium north of Tel Aviv with about 200 other journalists. The Israeli military had assembled us to view 43 minutes of raw footage from the Hamas attack, taken from terrorists’ body cameras and phones, in order to combat online disinformation and increase sympathy for Israel’s plight.\nI watched as journalists from around the world reacted to the atrocities on screen. Some gasped in horror. Others stepped out early, unable to bear the images and sounds of civilians being murdered, children killed, and bodies burned. One French reporter later told me, “It was too much. I knew coming here that the hardest thing for me would not be the images but the sound, because you can close your eyes if the images are too much.”\nI, too, closed my eyes at times, unable to bear the graphic imagery. Already at this early stage, I worried about the long-term personal consequences of covering such a brutal and graphic war on my psyche. Later, a therapist I saw encouraged a strategy of dissociation: keep these memories in a “war binder” in your mind, separate from the rest of your being.\nEasier said than done.\nI stayed for the entire screening, taking notes, observing reactions, gathering quotes – doing my job as a journalist. But I couldn’t separate myself from what I was witnessing. These weren’t abstract victims in a faraway conflict. They were my compatriots. They could have been my friends, my family. They could have been me, had I chosen a different festival that weekend. I wrote the article, filed it on time, maintained the professional distance expected. But inside, something was breaking.\nThe faces behind the headlines\nThree days after the attack, I covered a press conference in Tel Aviv where relatives of missing American citizens pleaded for the US government’s help. Among them was Rachel Goldberg, mother of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who had been at the Supernova festival. She recounted how her son was last seen leaving a bomb shelter with his “arm severed,” and had reportedly helped save lives by tossing back grenades thrown into the shelter.\nI am an alumnus of the Pardes Institute for Jewish Studies, where Rachel worked as an educator before the war, and have prayed at the same synagogue as the Goldberg-Polins in Jerusalem. In the months that followed, I pleaded with my editors for even more opportunities to write about the hostage families, as if the scale of life or death was balanced precariously upon my pen.\nWhen the horrific news came that Hersh Goldberg-Polin had been brutally murdered in captivity alongside Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, and Ori Danino, I felt not only sadness but also guilt and shame that I had not done enough as a journalist. I visited the family’s mourning tent, this time not as a journalist but as a fellow grieving citizen who was burned out. I told Hersh’s father Jon that I would pay tribute to his son’s memory at the Ganges River – embarking on the pilgrimage that Hersh had planned on taking before he was taken too soon.\nFinding healing in the jungle\nIn the year since I left the country, I could not come close to leaving the war behind –  instead choosing to interview Gazan refugees in the Greek island of Samos, discuss the finer points of nonviolent philosophy in the context of Israel’s war with Buddhist monks in Dharamsala, and visit perhaps the most popular vacation destination for Israelis fleeing the war abroad: Thailand’s Koh Phangan.\nThat’s how I found myself at David’s Circle, intrigued by writing about a unique therapeutic refuge for Israelis who, in my mind, had suffered far worse than I: those who attended the other music festival, like David Newman of blessed memory, for whom the circle is named.\nExcept that when I sat down for coffee to discuss the story’s parameters with Yael Shoshani-Rom, founder of David’s Circle and trauma specialist, she quickly corrected my own dismissive attitude. Almost all those who attend the circle, she explained, feel like they are undeserving of treatment and that someone else suffered more and is thus even more worthy of healing.\nFor months, I’ve written thousands of words about this war – chronicling the hostages’ plight, the grieving families, the political tensions, the international reactions. But until now, I haven’t written a single word about my own experience.\nBrené Brown, the renowned researcher on vulnerability, writes that “owning our story and loving ourselves through that process is the bravest thing we’ll ever do.” For a journalist trained to remain objective and detached, acknowledging my own wounds felt like crossing a professional line. But here, in this lush Thai sanctuary, I began to understand what Brown means when she says that “when we deny our stories, they define us. When we own our stories, we get to write a brave new ending.”\nI went as a journalist, but I stayed as a participant. I’m so grateful for the opportunity to finally acknowledge my own pain in writing about this war as I pray for it to end soon."}

I used to know a Polish Jew like that. He would never get so mad at someone as to cut contact completely and he dealt with all sorts of people, some mentally unstable.\nHe said it’s counterproductive and only hurts him in the long run – one, because he gets invested emotionally and lets some guy live in his head rent-free, and two, why shut yourself off from potential opportunities down the line? I like that thinking but, as in many cases  in life, it isn’t always that simple. To me, life is a mosaic, a wheel, a rollercoaster – not a ladder.\nType two is the so-called ”honorable type,” that permanently cuts contact with others for feeling wronged in some way. I’m a pragmatist and I place myself somewhere in the middle between type one and two. I don’t cut contact with people, even if they are from a different thought universe and get on my nerves, I enjoy exchanges of views up to a point. When it gets personal instead of subject-matter-debate, I’m not interested. It’s a waste of time.\nI just don’t keep in touch with people who are so far removed from my universe, it’s almost like talking to extraterrestrials, but they are out there, in my orbit somewhere.\nNow, sometimes, you come across people who need to be cut out of your life and you must distance yourself from them, because they’re trouble, like a black hole that’s going to suck you in. Energy vampires. Sometimes, you must be decisive and merciless. Sometimes, no clever formula how to deal with people, served on a silver platter by well-paid life coaches, works, only life experience. Did you ever get mad at someone? Did you do something stupid? Good. Your life experience is now much richer. To resolve conflict, you need to know how conflict feels. You need to experience conflict first-hand.\nOtherwise, you’re just an armchair expert and you will come across conflict, eventually. As Israelis, you know it much better than me.\nI’m sometimes put in the role of a mediator or a middle-man by people who, for whatever reason, no longer want to communicate with each other. I’m good at it, apparently, or so people tell me. I have this gift, again, or so some people tell me, to assume different points of view with ease, even if that point of view is absolutely absurd to me. I may not fully know the mental machinations of someone or the language they speak but I do get the gist of their thought process. Well, it’s a pretty bold statement, and it doesn’t always work, of course, but it has worked more than enough times for me. I wouldn’t venture to assume the point of view of some far-away tribe that doesn’t have any contact with civilization.\nI’ve had to deal with all sorts of people in my life – dramatically different personalities at times – it’s not a matter of choice, it’s just how God wanted it, I suppose. When I see children being brought up in bubbles, be it religious or otherwise, it’s a huge mistake but I’m not here to to tell someone thousands of miles away how to live. As we say in Polish, nie mój cyrk, nie moje małpy (not my circus, not my monkeys). We have religious nutcases in Poland but they are a picture of meekness and mercy in comparison with some radicals out there in the world.\nRight now, I’m in touch with my friend who works in the media. We’re trying to get my acquaintance – who does important work but I won’t disclose more details – on television. Is this going to work? All up to the powers that be on TV who are either going to accept or reject my friend’s pitch. Point being, we’ve tried. That’s what matters. You don’t always win your battles but you still learn something and may win the war. Cutting contact just because something didn’t work out isn’t a good strategy, especially if it didn’t work out because your friend or acquaintance had limited influence on the decision-makers and gatekeepers. Well, turns out, I’ve just learned, the pitch is a success. That’s what I’m talking about. Keep your options open.\nNow, death is the ultimate form of cutting contact, don’t you think? God cuts the cord of life. There are people consumed by grief who are desperate to connect with their loved ones and friends on the other side. Assuming there’s some kind of other side, as I can picture my militant atheist friends shaking their heads and laughing derisively. I’m not so arrogant as to claim to know if there’s some other side or not. It’s a really, really huge sign of confidence, hutzpah and hubris really, to be so sure about there being no God. What if God is mercurial and takes offense? That’s anthropomorphizing, I know. Just a fancy way of saying you attribute human characteristics to God. Anthropophagy is another seemingly fancy word you can use for something we all know. Something less than pleasant.\nAnyway. I’ve noticed there are many channels on social media with parents claiming to channel their dead children. Now, who knows what’s going on in the minds of these people. Maybe they really believe it, maybe they’re psychotic, but if they don’t hurt anyone, just leave them be and let them believe they are channeling their dead children if it brings them comfort. Who knows, in some rare cases, they might be the real deal. Electronic voice phenomenon, communicating with the other side via electronic devices, is intriguing. Anyone can test it out, that’s the best part. No need to pay for psychics or mediums. All you need is a digital recorder, a quiet place, ask a question, leave the rcorder runnning, walk out of the room, and that’s it. See what happens, if anything.\nI tested it out, expecting nothing, yet the results were intriguing.\nNow, this brings me to hell. To me, hell is the ultimate state of having been shut off from others. For example, from my lips to God’s ears, that’s the fate of a pompously intellectual Russian propagandist who usurped the name of Plato. She is stuck in the hell of ridiculousness, and forced to play Ukrainian songs on her violin in a swan lake attire – no need to reach out to her, she’s no longer relevant. She’s the butt of hell’s jokes for having lost her authority so epically."}

I am so proud of him, not only is he learning a new language and rooming with kids from all over the world. He is also working on the Meshek in the village, a farm with goats and produce, making some shekels and making everyone shuk shuka and fresh pita. Did I mention that he milks the goats? Since it is an international school, the students are from western and eastern Europe, mostly France and Russian speaking countries, as well as Ethiopian and a few English speaking kids. The goal in the first year of high school is Ulpan, and everyone is at different levels. Can you imagine being taught a new language by a teacher that only speaks another language that you do not understand? I told my kids, give us all two years, and we will catch the Hebrew, especially since we all went to Jewish schools, know how to read and write, and have heard it all the time in our Israeli community in Los Angeles.\nBecause everyone is in a different level of the language, the school tries to customize for each student, and sometimes moves classes, teachers and levels to find the right fit. Since the beginning of the year, the day my son worked in the Meshek was Tuesdays, and we were always excited for the fresh from the ground produce that he would bring for Shabbat. Just this month, they switched his Ulpan to Tuesday, and instead his Meshek day would be Wednesdays. He called me yesterday so frustrated, because this Tuesday will be the harvest at the Meshek, and not only did he want to help, but he has made such good friends there. They go hiking together, and enjoy cooking together for celebrations.\nMy whole family are realists. They see what can go wrong, are not sure if something will work out, and I am the only one that knows that I can at least try and ask. It is not easy maneuvering this reality. Some people would call it negative, but it is not a pessimistic view, maybe it is an old world view of our ancestors that suffered hardships.\nI Thank God Every Day! I am like my mother, and we choose to always think positive, on the side of hope, and see what happens. For me personally, to worry and be negative is a waste of energy, I stay in my happy bubble, deal with life, and climb right back in. We honestly do not know what the results and future will be, especially if we do not try. Another amazing trait of my mother is that we are not stuck on holidays, phone calls, or demands for each other’s time. We know that we are there for each other, and will move mountains if needed. Otherwise we are all busy with our lives and that is a good thing. I think we should celebrate mother’s every day, but I called with our time difference to wish her a Happy Mother’s Day. Even though she is happy, and celebrating with my brother and family and knows we are literally in a different world, and would not care. She deserves to be celebrated and honored, because she is really one of a kind, and I would not be who I am without her influence, energy and love in my life.\nSo back to my son, I told him I could try to see if I can ask for the teacher to allow him to miss Ulpan to help with the harvest. My son said it will not work, and it is no use to try. Luckily I have a magical person that is one of his counselors, and she speaks good English and since the beginning of school has been directing me to the right people to talk to to get things done. I voice messaged her, she gave me the contact of the Ulpan, I asked, and he said no problem. I thanked him and let him know that I am grateful, and my son will be so happy. I got a call before I went to bed last night, wishing me a Happy Mother’s Day, and telling me that appreciates me in his life for everything I do. That is one of my love languages, words of appreciation and I also crave acts of service, especially when someone cooks for me or treats me to a meal.\nMy personal philosophy is about care of self and love of self. It is not selfish, it is self care. If you do not take care of yourself, who will do it for you. Always check in, always replenish and recharge, so you can be there for everything and everything in your life. I always say that I come first, then my husband and only after that my children. It is the only way I know how to operate, stay sane, and live my purpose fully in this world. It has nothing to do with Ego, it is all about me in a good way. So I could be my best, at my best.\nThe picture above is from a book called The Wealthy Spirit by Chellie Campbell. I will write it out fully below, so you can see it clearly and enjoy the daily lesson. It is meant to be read in one year, there are 365 pages. We have chosen to open in mostly on Shabbat, and sometimes we are busy with celebrating life or sleeping, and get back to it when inspiration strikes, We have had the book for a few years, thanks to Doda Mollie, and are on page 198.\nYOU HAVE THE POWER TO CHOOSE WHAT YOU BELIEVE, CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVE, AND BE A COCREATOR OF YOUR LIFE AND REALITY.\n“One lazy Sunday afternoon, I opened up my keepsake trunk and pulled out some of my old scrapbooks. Nostalgically, I reminisced over pictures of high school dances, dried flowers, from the corsage I wore at the cotillion, drama reviews of plays performed, bits of cheerleading pompon, I remember the hopes and dreams of the girl I was then and the fun I had dancing through the days dappled with sunlight and shadows.\nThe phone rang, bringing me back to current reality. It was my friend Carol. when she asked me what I’d been doing, I told her I had been having fun looking through my “remembrances of things past.”\n“Ugh,” Carol exclaimed. “I hate to do that”\n“You do”? I asked. “Why?”\n“Because it reminds me how fast life is passing and how much time has gone already. I’m getting older and there’s a shorter and shorter length of time left to live.”\n“Well, of course, that’s true. but then there’s the next life to look forward to!”\n“No, I don’t believe in that,” said Carol. “There’s only one life and this is it. I’m an atheist. When you die there’s nothing.”\n“Oh, I can see why that would make you feel bad. it must be scary, too,” I commiserated.\nCarol agreed that it was very scary–and depressing.\n“Well then, Carol,” I said, “I think you should change your beliefs. we are both experiencing the passing of time, but I’m happy about it and you’re miserable.\n“But I believe what I believe!” she protested, “I can’t just change my beliefs!”\n“Sure you can,” I replied. “Look at it logically: if you are right, when I die–I won’t know. There’ll just be nothing. But I’ll live this whole life happily, thinking my beliefs are true. Your belief, on the other hand, makes you miserable. And if I’m right, and there’s a life on the other side of this one, you’re going to be very surprised. And you would have been unhappy all this time for no reason. So the smart choice is to choose a belief that makes you happy to believe it right now!”\nNot sure she got it. do you? Re-examine all your beliefs right now. What limiting beliefs do you have–about anything–what makes you miserable? Find evidence to believe things that make you happy instead. You can believe that “the world is a terrible place” and prove it by example/ But I can say “the world is a beautiful place” and prove it just as easily. For which belief do you want to gather proof? Do you want to think positive or not?"}

It stressed that Israel did not agree to a ceasefire or to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Alexander — only to provide a safe corridor to allow for his release.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nBut this claim was rejected by Golan, who insisted that it was “not for nothing that Trump bypassed Netanyahu. Trump understood what millions of Israelis already know: Netanyahu has no intention of returning the hostages or ending the war. The only goal that motivates him is personal survival. Even at the cost of human life.”\nEdan Alexander (left) with his family (from left to right): mother Yael, brother Roy, sister Mika, and father Adi. (Courtesy of Alexander family)\nTrump now understands that Netanyahu “is an obstacle to security and the release of the hostages,” Golan continued, asserting that occupying the Gaza Strip will only lead to more deaths and “economic devastation.”\nOpposition Leader Yair Lapid also criticized the government for allowing itself to be cut out of the loop, stating that it represented “a diplomatic failure with consequences that endanger the security and well-being of the entire State of Israel.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“This alliance [with the US] is the greatest strategic asset that the State of Israel has,” but while the Trump administration praises the Netanyahu government publicly, the “Americans are fed up with Netanyahu,” Lapid asserted.\n“The Trump administration is operating today without coordination and without listening to Netanyahu. They have reached a ceasefire with the Houthis in Yemen behind his back, are conducting dangerous negotiations with the Iranians, are promoting a Saudi nuclear program, and are making a hostage deal only for their own citizens,” Lapid said. “There has never been anything like this.”\n“Trump is a pro-Israel president. He loves Israel, but he hates dragging his feet, and postponements and delays, and hesitation, and lies,” Lapid continued. “He wants a ceasefire in Gaza, he wants a big hostage deal, he wants regional agreements that will help the American economy. Netanyahu does not know how to give him that. Not with this government.”\nYisrael Beytenu chairman Avigdor Liberman sounded a similar note, telling reporters that, “unfortunately, [Alexander’s] return is not happening as a result of Israeli pressure or a decision, but as a result of direct contact between the US and Hamas.”\nOpposition leader and Yesh Atid party head MK Yair Lapid speaks at a faction meeting in the Knesset on May 12, 2025. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nIsrael has “reached an unprecedented low” in its relations with the United States, Liberman argued, bemoaning “the [US] ceasefire with the Houthis when the State of Israel is left out of the agreement, the US president’s visit to the region when he skips Israel, [and] the direct negotiations between the US and Iran.”\nLast week, Trump announced that the US would stop bombing Yemen’s Houthis, after the Iran-backed group agreed to stop interrupting important shipping lanes in the Middle East.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe announcement did not mention the ongoing Houthi attacks on Israel, and a spokesman for the Yemeni rebel group pledged that such strikes would continue. Israeli officials told Hebrew media outlets that Washington did not give Jerusalem advance notice of the announcement, and that Israel was surprised by it.\nTrump also reportedly quashed Israeli proposals for a series of joint strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, opting instead to try for a diplomatic solution to the problem of Tehran’s nuclear program.\nThe Trump administration has sent mixed messages regarding Iran, stating both that it wants Tehran’s nuclear program completely destroyed and also insisting that it is open to letting the Islamic Republic pursue civilian nuclear energy.\nAt the same time, Trump is heading to the Middle East on Monday on a multi-country tour in which the US president will skip Israel, but will stop in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, leading government critics to warn that Jerusalem is being left out of Washington’s regional diplomatic initiatives.\nUS President Donald Trump takes questions outside the West Wing of White House in Washington, DC, on May 8, 2025. (Jim WATSON / AFP)\nAccording to Arabic media reports, Trump is also set to meet Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, and Syria’s de facto leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa.\nAnd despite previously insisting that Saudi Arabia will join the Abraham Accords— the series of normalization agreements that his previous administration brokered between Israel and several Arab states — Trump has reportedly dropped normalization with Israel as a condition for progress on Saudi Arabia’s civilian nuclear program.\nAgainst this backdrop, National Unity chairman Benny Gantz warned on Monday that Israel must get on board with American plans for the Middle East or be left behind.\nAddressing the press ahead of his party’s weekly faction meeting, Gantz said that “the American administration is determined to promote normalization with Saudi Arabia and other large and significant countries in the region.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Either we complete a strategic transformation, strengthen the axis against Iran, destroy its military nuclear capability, and become part of a vast comprehensive political move led by the United States in the region, or we will be left behind,” he warned. “The opportunity to change the Middle East must not be missed because of political considerations.”\n‘We must stop procrastinating and go on the offensive’\nFar-right members of Netanyahu’s coalition pushed back hard against such criticism, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich declaring, “You have to be crazy to turn an event like [Edan Alexander’s release] into something that is against the government.”\nFinance Minister Religious Zionist party head Bezalel Smotrich leads a faction meeting at the Knesset in Jerusalem, May 12, 2025.

We must stop delaying and launch the decisive attack.

Shelling was also reported by other outlets.\nAFP reported earlier Monday that a Hamas source said the terror group was informed by mediators that Israel would pause military operations in Gaza for the handover of Alexander.\n“Hamas was informed that at exactly 9:30 a.m., Israel began halting its reconnaissance, drone, and warplane flights, as well as combat operations, to create a safe corridor for the transfer and handover of Edan,” the source said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraelis await the release of US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, whom Hamas is expected to release from captivity, at Hostage Square in Tel Aviv May 12, 2025.

From there, he will be brought out of the Strip, and from there taken to a facility at the Re’im base.\nAt the IDF facility near Re’im, Alexander will receive an initial physical and mental checkup, and meet with members of his family who will be waiting there. He will then be airlifted to Sourasky Hospital in Tel Aviv.\nIn the event of a medical emergency, Alexander will be immediately taken to Soroka Hospital in Beersheba or Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon, without passing through the Re’im site.\nThere was no word yet on where or when the handover will take place.\nRepublican US presidential nominee Donald Trump poses for photos with the family of Edan Alexander at Ohel Chabad Lubavitch on October 7, 2024, in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago / Getty Images via AFP)\nAlexander, a dual citizen who grew up in New Jersey, was serving in the IDF’s Golani Brigade at the time of his abduction. He was kidnapped from his base near the Gaza border community of Nirim, known as the White House post, during the October 7 onslaught.\nIn a statement, Hamas announced on Sunday its decision to release Alexander after recent talks with US officials and “intensified efforts to achieve a ceasefire, open border crossings, and allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the US informed it of Hamas’s intent to release Alexander “without compensation or conditions” and that the step is expected to lead to negotiations on a truce.\nNetanyahu’s government was angered by US direct talks with Hamas earlier this year that led to a Hamas offer to release Alexander and the bodies of four other hostages if Israel recommitted to a stalled ceasefire deal. Days later, however, Israel resumed the war.\nUS President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff told AP that Hamas’s goal in releasing Alexander was to restart talks on a ceasefire, the release of additional hostages and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza before Israel carries out a threatened total takeover of the territory.\nIndirect talks between Hamas and the US began five days ago, an Egyptian official and a senior Hamas official told AP, with both describing the release of Alexander as a goodwill gesture.\nAlexander will be the first male hostage soldier abducted by Hamas on October 7, 2023, to be returned to Israel by the terror group.\nOn October 7, Hamas took 19 male soldiers hostage — not all of them on duty — and seven female surveillance soldiers, the latter of whom have all since been returned to Israel (five in a deal with Hamas, one rescued alive, and the body of one recovered by troops.)\nCurrently, Hamas is holding 14 male Israeli soldiers hostage, eight of whom have been declared dead, among them the body of Lt. Hadar Goldin, who was killed in 2014.\nThe apparent pause comes as Israel has been pushing ahead with its military operations in Gaza.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Israeli Air Force struck over 50 targets in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, the military said, including cells of terror operatives and buildings used by terror groups to plan and carry out attacks.\nAdditionally, the IDF said ground forces targeted a Hamas command center, caches of weapons, and sniper positions.\nHamas authorities reported 19 killed and dozens wounded during the previous 24 hours. The toll could not immediately be verified and did not differentiate between civilians and gunmen."}

It stressed that Israel did not agree to a ceasefire or to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Alexander — only to provide a safe corridor to allow for his release.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nBut this claim was rejected by Golan, who insisted that it was “not for nothing that Trump bypassed Netanyahu. Trump understood what millions of Israelis already know: Netanyahu has no intention of returning the hostages or ending the war. The only goal that motivates him is personal survival. Even at the cost of human life.”\nEdan Alexander (left) with his family (from left to right): mother Yael, brother Roy, sister Mika, and father Adi. (Courtesy of Alexander family)\nTrump now understands that Netanyahu “is an obstacle to security and the release of the hostages,” Golan continued, asserting that occupying the Gaza Strip will only lead to more deaths and “economic devastation.”\nOpposition Leader Yair Lapid also criticized the government for allowing itself to be cut out of the loop, stating that it represented “a diplomatic failure with consequences that endanger the security and well-being of the entire State of Israel.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“This alliance [with the US] is the greatest strategic asset that the State of Israel has,” but while the Trump administration praises the Netanyahu government publicly, the “Americans are fed up with Netanyahu,” Lapid asserted.\n“The Trump administration is operating today without coordination and without listening to Netanyahu. They have reached a ceasefire with the Houthis in Yemen behind his back, are conducting dangerous negotiations with the Iranians, are promoting a Saudi nuclear program, and are making a hostage deal only for their own citizens,” Lapid said. “There has never been anything like this.”\n“Trump is a pro-Israel president. He loves Israel, but he hates dragging his feet, and postponements and delays, and hesitation, and lies,” Lapid continued. “He wants a ceasefire in Gaza, he wants a big hostage deal, he wants regional agreements that will help the American economy. Netanyahu does not know how to give him that. Not with this government.”\nYisrael Beytenu chairman Avigdor Liberman sounded a similar note, telling reporters that, “unfortunately, [Alexander’s] return is not happening as a result of Israeli pressure or a decision, but as a result of direct contact between the US and Hamas.”\nOpposition leader and Yesh Atid party head MK Yair Lapid speaks at a faction meeting in the Knesset on May 12, 2025. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nIsrael has “reached an unprecedented low” in its relations with the United States, Liberman argued, bemoaning “the [US] ceasefire with the Houthis when the State of Israel is left out of the agreement, the US president’s visit to the region when he skips Israel, [and] the direct negotiations between the US and Iran.”\nLast week, Trump announced that the US would stop bombing Yemen’s Houthis, after the Iran-backed group agreed to stop interrupting important shipping lanes in the Middle East.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe announcement did not mention the ongoing Houthi attacks on Israel, and a spokesman for the Yemeni rebel group pledged that such strikes would continue. Israeli officials told Hebrew media outlets that Washington did not give Jerusalem advance notice of the announcement, and that Israel was surprised by it.\nTrump also reportedly quashed Israeli proposals for a series of joint strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, opting instead to try for a diplomatic solution to the problem of Tehran’s nuclear program.\nThe Trump administration has sent mixed messages regarding Iran, stating both that it wants Tehran’s nuclear program completely destroyed and also insisting that it is open to letting the Islamic Republic pursue civilian nuclear energy.\nAt the same time, Trump is heading to the Middle East on Monday on a multi-country tour in which the US president will skip Israel, but will stop in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, leading government critics to warn that Jerusalem is being left out of Washington’s regional diplomatic initiatives.\nUS President Donald Trump takes questions outside the West Wing of White House in Washington, DC, on May 8, 2025. (Jim WATSON / AFP)\nAccording to Arabic media reports, Trump is also set to meet Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, and Syria’s de facto leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa.\nAnd despite previously insisting that Saudi Arabia will join the Abraham Accords— the series of normalization agreements that his previous administration brokered between Israel and several Arab states — Trump has reportedly dropped normalization with Israel as a condition for progress on Saudi Arabia’s civilian nuclear program.\nAgainst this backdrop, National Unity chairman Benny Gantz warned on Monday that Israel must get on board with American plans for the Middle East or be left behind.\nAddressing the press ahead of his party’s weekly faction meeting, Gantz said that “the American administration is determined to promote normalization with Saudi Arabia and other large and significant countries in the region.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Either we complete a strategic transformation, strengthen the axis against Iran, destroy its military nuclear capability, and become part of a vast comprehensive political move led by the United States in the region, or we will be left behind,” he warned. “The opportunity to change the Middle East must not be missed because of political considerations.”\n‘We must stop procrastinating and go on the offensive’\nFar-right members of Netanyahu’s coalition pushed back hard against such criticism, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich declaring, “You have to be crazy to turn an event like [Edan Alexander’s release] into something that is against the government.”\nFinance Minister Religious Zionist party head Bezalel Smotrich leads a faction meeting at the Knesset in Jerusalem, May 12, 2025. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\n“A heroic fighter, a lone soldier who came to Israel to enlist in the army and serve the homeland, is released from captivity without any compensation or conditions — we are not releasing a single terrorist, we are not delivering humanitarian aid, we are not stopping the war and we are not surrendering,” Smotrich told reporters in the Knesset ahead of his Religious Zionism party’s weekly faction meeting.\n“Just two months ago, there were those who were talking about how, in order to free Edan, we would have to release 250 murderous terrorists with blood on their hands,” but now he is being freed “because we have created military and political pressure on Hamas,” Smotrich claimed.\nHamas “understands that we have no intention of surrendering and if it wants something, it is the one who has to pay upfront and not the other way around,” he asserted — adding that the government is “committed to bringing about everyone’s release.”\nNational Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir also endorsed a more aggressive approach in Gaza, telling reporters that Israel had “received American backing to open the gates of hell on Gaza — we must stop procrastinating, and go on the offensive to defeat it.”\nIn an appeal to Netanyahu, Ben Gvir said that “President Trump gave us backing several months ago to open the gates of hell on Hamas, and we are delaying. We must stop delaying and launch the decisive attack. To occupy the entire territory of the Gaza Strip, and to encourage the migration of Gazans to countries around the world.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nSmotrich and Ben Gvir’s comments, however, appeared at odds with recent statements by senior American officials.\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff arrives for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin (not in picture) in Moscow, Russia, April 25, 2025.

Why wouldn’t they? It’s our war – and theirs by proxy. One of the most telling examples is our differing perceptions about bomb shelters. Israelis see them as life saving spaces protecting us from potential missile strikes. But outside of Israel the shelters are viewed negatively and many people are terrified to spend any time there.\nFor the second time in a matter of days the fear of bomb shelters by potential visitors has been a topic of conversation.\nIn the first incident North American guests invited to a family celebration in Israel are refusing to attend because they are too afraid of what will happen if the sirens sound and they literally have to take shelter — in a shelter.\n“I don’t think I could handle sitting in a bomb shelter,” said one guest who has decided to stay away. When the Israeli branch of the family heard that, they looked at each other with baffled consternation: “What? He has a problem with the bomb shelter? Why? What does he think happens in there? We’re only there for 10 minutes max. He can’t sit on a chair in our shelter for a few minutes? Even if he has snacks?”\nThen there’s another scenario. A family who frequently spend their summers in Israel is not coming this summer for fear that the sirens and the shelters will cause irrevocable emotional damage to their children. Some Israelis understand their concern — most do not.\nI don’t dare mention to either shelter-phobic friend that one of my children went through a phase about 10 years ago where he refused to go to the shelter when the sirens sounded because, as he said at the time: “If it’s my time to go then it’s my time.” He was the ripe old age of 16 when he said that.\nAt least twice since October 7, 2023, we have hosted strangers in our shelter. It’s not clear how they got there but it doesn’t really matter. Two of them were lying on the ground outside our house as my daughter raced home and she invited them in. They joined the conversation for a few minutes and then left. We even gave them snacks.\nBomb shelters in Israel have saved countless lives. They are built into houses and apartment buildings throughout the country. Having a protected space isn’t optional here. It’s been the law since 1951. The Civil Defense Law says that all residential, commercial and industrial construction built from that time forward, must include protected spaces.\nUnfortunately it wasn’t always a law and older buildings don’t have them. They are not like a few days in a five-star hotel, but being alive in a cramped shelter with your old paint cans, suitcases, and succah decorations is far better than being dead in a fancy hotel.\nSome apartment buildings don’t have individual protected space in each unit. They have one large shelter for everyone in the building. In one recent case the sirens sounded in the middle of the night and a lot of babies who lived in the building weren’t so happy about having their sleep disrupted. They arrived in the shelter crying until the older residents started singing to them in unison and they went back to sleep.\nMost of the time in the shelter during the past year and a half involved rounding up the people in the house, trying to find the dog, and entering the shelter for a few minutes. Once you heard the booms when the missiles were intercepted, you had to wait a few more minutes in case of falling debris and then you were free to leave. You could even take your shelter snacks with you.\nThere have been times in Israel’s modern history where people have been required to stay in their shelters for extended periods. That can’t have been fun. It required frequent forays for snacks and toilet relief, but it was survivable and far better than the alternative.\nIt’s impossible to guarantee visitors that they won’t have to go to shelters or lie down on the side of the road during this war. Our enemies are unpredictable at best. Fortunately, for the most part, they have lousy aim and we have impressive defenses. So should people stay away from Israel for fear of missiles? I am going to say no. There are snacks in the shelter."}
{"website": "timesofisrael", "url": null, "link": "https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/beyond-the-byline-an-israeli-journalists-healing-journey/", "title": "Beyond the byline: An Israeli journalist’s healing journey", "media_type": "blog", "date": "MAY 12, 2025, 2:17 PM", "content": "On the morning of October 7, 2023, I awoke in a tent at a music festival like other young Israelis celebrating the holiday of Simchat Torah. By chance, my festival was located in Shittim, a small southern community one hour north of Eilat, and not the Nova festival at Kibbutz Re’im in which over 360 concert-goers were murdered and dozens more taken captive. As I corresponded with my editor, trying to understand the gravity of the situation, I heard the sobs of others around me desperately trying to reach parents who lived in the Gaza envelope and others besides themselves with worry for friends who were already considered “missing” from the Nova festival.\nIn the months that followed, as I embarked upon my first full-time journalistic position covering Israel at war, I would often think about the mysterious workings of fate – why I woke up in a tent surrounded by panic but not terror, while peers of mine woke to gunfire and death. This arbitrary fortune haunted me throughout my reporting on the war that followed and to the present day.\nDocumenting horror: The trauma behind the byline\nTwo weeks after the attack, a nation – and me with it – reeling in shock, I found myself in a military auditorium north of Tel Aviv with about 200 other journalists. The Israeli military had assembled us to view 43 minutes of raw footage from the Hamas attack, taken from terrorists’ body cameras and phones, in order to combat online disinformation and increase sympathy for Israel’s plight.\nI watched as journalists from around the world reacted to the atrocities on screen. Some gasped in horror. Others stepped out early, unable to bear the images and sounds of civilians being murdered, children killed, and bodies burned. One French reporter later told me, “It was too much. I knew coming here that the hardest thing for me would not be the images but the sound, because you can close your eyes if the images are too much.”\nI, too, closed my eyes at times, unable to bear the graphic imagery. Already at this early stage, I worried about the long-term personal consequences of covering such a brutal and graphic war on my psyche. Later, a therapist I saw encouraged a strategy of dissociation: keep these memories in a “war binder” in your mind, separate from the rest of your being.\nEasier said than done.\nI stayed for the entire screening, taking notes, observing reactions, gathering quotes – doing my job as a journalist. But I couldn’t separate myself from what I was witnessing. These weren’t abstract victims in a faraway conflict. They were my compatriots. They could have been my friends, my family. They could have been me, had I chosen a different festival that weekend. I wrote the article, filed it on time, maintained the professional distance expected. But inside, something was breaking.\nThe faces behind the headlines\nThree days after the attack, I covered a press conference in Tel Aviv where relatives of missing American citizens pleaded for the US government’s help. Among them was Rachel Goldberg, mother of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who had been at the Supernova festival. She recounted how her son was last seen leaving a bomb shelter with his “arm severed,” and had reportedly helped save lives by tossing back grenades thrown into the shelter.\nI am an alumnus of the Pardes Institute for Jewish Studies, where Rachel worked as an educator before the war, and have prayed at the same synagogue as the Goldberg-Polins in Jerusalem. In the months that followed, I pleaded with my editors for even more opportunities to write about the hostage families, as if the scale of life or death was balanced precariously upon my pen.\nWhen the horrific news came that Hersh Goldberg-Polin had been brutally murdered in captivity alongside Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, and Ori Danino, I felt not only sadness but also guilt and shame that I had not done enough as a journalist. I visited the family’s mourning tent, this time not as a journalist but as a fellow grieving citizen who was burned out. I told Hersh’s father Jon that I would pay tribute to his son’s memory at the Ganges River – embarking on the pilgrimage that Hersh had planned on taking before he was taken too soon.\nFinding healing in the jungle\nIn the year since I left the country, I could not come close to leaving the war behind –  instead choosing to interview Gazan refugees in the Greek island of Samos, discuss the finer points of nonviolent philosophy in the context of Israel’s war with Buddhist monks in Dharamsala, and visit perhaps the most popular vacation destination for Israelis fleeing the war abroad: Thailand’s Koh Phangan.\nThat’s how I found myself at David’s Circle, intrigued by writing about a unique therapeutic refuge for Israelis who, in my mind, had suffered far worse than I: those who attended the other music festival, like David Newman of blessed memory, for whom the circle is named.\nExcept that when I sat down for coffee to discuss the story’s parameters with Yael Shoshani-Rom, founder of David’s Circle and trauma specialist, she quickly corrected my own dismissive attitude. Almost all those who attend the circle, she explained, feel like they are undeserving of treatment and that someone else suffered more and is thus even more worthy of healing.\nFor months, I’ve written thousands of words about this war – chronicling the hostages’ plight, the grieving families, the political tensions, the international reactions. But until now, I haven’t written a single word about my own experience.\nBrené Brown, the renowned researcher on vulnerability, writes that “owning our story and loving ourselves through that process is the bravest thing we’ll ever do.” For a journalist trained to remain objective and detached, acknowledging my own wounds felt like crossing a professional line. But here, in this lush Thai sanctuary, I began to understand what Brown means when she says that “when we deny our stories, they define us. When we own our stories, we get to write a brave new ending.”\nI went as a journalist, but I stayed as a participant. I’m so grateful for the opportunity to finally acknowledge my own pain in writing about this war as I pray for it to end soon."}

With his sons’ bodies before him in the Tabernacle, the Torah states: “Vayidom Aharon,”- “And Aaron was silent.” (Vayikra 10:3)\nCommentators throughout the ages have embraced Aaron’s response as a quiet nobility in the face of overwhelming loss. The Midrash even teaches that Aaron was rewarded with prophecy for his restraint. Approaching this episode through the prism of pain, Ramban holds that while Aaron did initially sob loudly, he quickly contained his grief.\nThe Medieval rabbinic commentator Ba’al HaTurim goes in a different direction, pointing out that “Vayidom” appears only one other time with the same spelling in all of Tanakh. Joshua 10:13 reads: “Vayidom Hashemesh” – “Then the sun stood still.” There, “Vayidom” isn’t about quiet; rather, it’s about stillness, the halting of time itself.\nThis other translation of “Vayidom” invites us to look at Aaron’s behavior in a new way. Perhaps what Aaron experienced is less about stoic silence than disorientation in the face of loss.\nAs many of us know, the loss of a loved one can upend our lives and make time lose meaning. Shiva itself can feel both like an eternity and a blink. In mourning, we may not know what to say, let alone move forward.\nNearly 30 years ago, when my father died, it was an unexpected life disruption. Even when we finally embraced that there would be no miracle cure for pancreatic cancer, it still seems hard to fathom that my father would go so quickly.\nJust after my father died, job search season commenced during my last year in rabbinical school. The bitter irony was that I entered into search when I was essentially lost on an emotional level.\nBut I wasn’t the only one. During shiva, multiple family members and close friends pulled me aside. Concerned about my mother, they suggested, “Look for a job in Boston, so you can take care of your mother. Maybe you should take a year off.” Their message was clear: my mother would need support as she shouldered the family business and took her place at the head of the dining room table.\nOne weekend, as my job search unfolded, I came home for Shabbat. Sitting at the kitchen table, my mother and I talked about the future, even though we were barely functioning in the present.\nAfter informing her of job openings in Chicago, LA, and Baltimore, I shared what was percolating inside: “Mom, I’m thinking about staying close to home.”\n“Are there any jobs up here?”\n“No.”\n“Why would you do that?” Her quizzical expression showed she wasn’t buying it.\n“To tell you the truth, some members of our family think you need help, and I want to do my part.”\nI expected relief and gratitude from my mother, but instead, courage and determination glared back at me. Suddenly, I remembered who I was talking to.\nWhen my father proposed to my mother, he said, “If you love me, you’ll move with me to Israel.” You have to understand that up until this time in her life, my mother had barely spent a night away from her parents’ home. Swept away by the man, the dream, and the family they dreamed of creating, this nineteen-year-old and her groom left for Israel two days after their wedding in 1960.\nNext to my gregarious father, my mother appeared to be a quiet, reserved presence. But all along, a courageous soul and humble persistence have guided her path and our family.\nThat night, in a home with palpable grief still lingering in the air, her blue eyes met mine as she asserted, “You have worked your whole life for this. You’re not coming home. Dad wouldn’t want it, and neither do I. You have to go!”\nWhen the conversation ended, I didn’t just get up from the kitchen table, I took my first steps towards healing. With my mother’s strength as my guide, time had resumed.\nIn the Torah, Aaron’s response to loss may have indeed been silence. Not because he was stoic or speechless, but because mourning and loss can be disorienting.\nBut Hashem never lets the story end there. Again and again, our tradition insists that “Acharei Mot”, after death, there will be a new chapter of life. And the first step forward awaits whenever we are ready to take it.\nDedicated in honor of my mother, Linda Mirkin Savenor, for Mother’s Day."}

Iran will be forced to dismantle its nuclear facilities or maybe just cease enrichment; maybe destroy its centrifuges “nicely” or have them blown up “viciously,” or maybe just promise not to use them to make weapons. Anyone trying to follow US President Donald Trump’s sudden and frequent policy lurches will be tempted to reach for the Dramamine. Politicians often change their minds – then-Senator John Kerry was famously for the war in Iraq before he was against it – but it’s safe to say no president has ever executed so many head-spinning, diametric reversals in so short a time. Four months have not yet passed since his inauguration.\nThis chaotic behavior, in my view, has two sources. The first is Trump’s desperate need to see himself as a winner (even if not actually winning). The second is competition for his attention among close advisors with very different views. Most relevant for Israel is the cleavage within his foreign-policy team. Vice President JD Vance, Susie Wiles, and Donald Trump Jr. lead a neo-isolationist cadre that gauges foreign relations in terms of transactional benefits to America. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz advocate a more assertive – and more traditionally Republican – US role in global affairs. Trump also pays attention to media gadflies such as Tucker Carlson and Laura Loomer, who serve as windows to the soul of his political base.\nTrump listens to these discordant voices and decides whose advice is likely, at a given juncture, to make him look like a winner. And he goes with that until it no longer feels like winning. Then he goes with someone else. The underlying merits and the repercussions are secondary or irrelevant. What counts is public perception, or at least how he reads it.\nUpon assuming office for the second time, Trump’s priority was to banish as much global conflict as possible so as to burnish his war-ending persona and draw a favorable contrast from his predecessor. That didn’t work so well with Russia and Ukraine, but like virtually all previous US presidents, he knew he could pressure Israel into supporting American priorities – in this case, a ceasefire with Hamas. It took Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by surprise but didn’t work out too badly for him, since a substantial segment of the Israeli public supported the agreement’s first phase and Netanyahu declined, without backlash, to pursue the far more controversial subsequent phases.\nPresident Donald Trump speaks while meeting with Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni (unseen) in the Oval Office of the White House, April 17, 2025, in Washington, as Vice President JD Vance, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth listen. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\nSince then, Trump has threatened Hamas with “hell to pay” if all hostages – or American hostages, or, right, actually all hostages – were not released; unleashed substantial firepower against Yemen’s Houthi rebels and threatened them with “complete annihilation”; and reimposed “maximum pressure” sanctions against Iran while threatening to destroy their nuclear facilities. These all bear the fingerprints of the muscular foreign-policy cadre.\nHamas neither released any hostages nor faced hell, Iran remained defiant, and the Houthis still managed to mount attacks against ships in the Red Sea, including American naval vessels. Plainly, none of this felt very much like winning. Soon, Trump was engaging in dialogue with Iran, which obliged him by muzzling the Houthis to “build momentum” in the talks – i.e., to hand Trump a win he could boast of and a debt to be collected later. The neo-isolationists now had the upper hand. Unsourced statements suggested Trump might even be considering a return to the terms of Obama’s disastrous nuclear deal with Iran, which would please the neo-isolationists since they don’t perceive Iran as a threat to US shores. But it ignited a firestorm among right-wing commentators, who reminded Trump how mightily he inveighed against that deal before dramatically exiting it in 2018. Manhood check! Trump quickly pivoted to “nicely” or “viciously” and postponed further talks.\nRead: Trump: Iran’s centrifuges will either ‘blow up nicely’ in a deal or ‘viciously’ without one\nWhat happens next? Talks with Iran are back on. The neo-isolationists perceive the vigor of Trump’s manly threats as cover for a renewed effort to accommodate the mullahs. If they can get some concession from Iran that arguably – even if not credibly – extends beyond the Obama deal, they think they can sell it to Trump as a momentous win. They have learned by now that no line he draws in the sand is fixed if its erasure can be spun favorably.\nIn the meantime, Trump’s team has been feeling out the possibility of bringing Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords – a signature Trump win in his first administration. Getting Saudi on board would not only gild that win but achieve what his hated predecessor, Joe Biden, sought strenuously but failed to obtain. The obstacles were, and remain, Saudi insistence on an end to the Gaza war and a pathway to Palestinian statehood as prerequisites.\nJoe Biden and his State Department seemed genuinely puzzled over Israel’s refusal on both counts. But they overestimated the value of Saudi normalization to Israel. The two countries have cooperated fruitfully and quietly since Obama signed his nuclear deal with Iran. The tangible benefits of normalization to Israel would be few, and the risks to the Saudi government significant. Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, is engaged in a long-term project of reforming and modernizing his country in the face of fierce opposition from religious fundamentalists and members of his own royal family. Attempts to placate the Palestinians would make recognition of the “Zionist entity” by the cradle of Islam no less of an abomination to religious zealots. And the Palestinians have always refused to be placated.\nOne can almost imagine bin Salman colluding with Netanyahu to keep the bar to normalization unachievably high, precisely to avoid upending the productive status quo. But Trump needs a win, and facts are beside the point. The Palestinians have had a Jew-free state in all of Gaza since 2005. We know how that experiment turned out. And ending the Gaza war on Hamas’s terms, which have not meaningfully changed since they perpetrated the horrors of October 7, would simply start the countdown to the next pogrom. We have experimental evidence for that proposition as well: Israel is fighting its fifth war with Hamas, having allowed it to survive and thrive after each of the previous four.\nThese are merely facts, however, and Trump needs a win. We’ll see how far he’s willing to go to get it, how eager MBS is to cooperate, and how much fortitude Netanyahu is prepared to show in defending Israel’s core interests. Rumor has Trump preparing to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. The perfidy and self-defeating destructiveness of such a move can’t be overstated. But in a Machiavellian world of princes and winners, nothing is unthinkable."}

The conversation – and the larger one surrounding the Israeli-Gazan conflict – has had a stranglehold over Jewish-American discourse for the better part of two years. I girded myself for the usual talking points. You know the ones. But when the discussion started, my father suggested, almost off-handedly, Trump’s interventions wouldn’t have been necessary “if Jews weren’t such wimps.”\nI blinked.\n“…wimps?”\n“Weak,” he amended. “Y’know – pussies.”\nMy father was born in Far Rockaway, Queens in 1952. It was a more physical world. Activism was sweaty. It played out on the streets, not screens. When he was a teenager, he witnessed the rise of the Black Panthers, the political and community organization founded by Bobby Seale and Huey Newton in Oakland, California in 1966. The group was based on the notion that if you were going to mess with Black America, Black America would mess back. Members were armed to the teeth as they escorted their own down the block, protecting them from police. When the California State Assembly gathered to discuss the Mulford Act – a measure which would ban the public carrying of firearms – Seale and others stood on the Assembly steps, rifles at attention like spears.\n“Why can’t we do that?” my father asked me. “Why can’t there be Jewish Black Panthers?”\nNever mind the more problematic elements of the Panthers – the internal strife, the shootouts with police. What my father really suggested was a new Jewish physicality. A security not in words, but presence.\nWhen I attended the ADL conference in New York in March, I was struck by the pride on display. Israeli actress Gal Gadot headlined the closing ceremony, bringing many to tears with her rallying cry, “my name is Gal, and I am Jewish.” Jewish college students spoke of their fears on campus to many an “Am Yisrael Chai.” When I was interviewed by Jewish comedians Judy Gold and Hughie Stone Fish, they were insistent I take out my chai necklace and show it to the world. This pride was channeled into speaking out on socials, putting pressure on colleges and other institutions to review their security protocols, and generally shed light on the antisemitic experiences faced by so many each day.\nBut not once, during the entirety of the proceedings, was there a call to flood the campuses themselves – no thought that perhaps all the thousands in attendance would better flex their solidarity out there, on the streets, protecting their own, shoulder-to-shoulder. The fervor was left to evaporate. A boiling pool of frustration and fear, steamed off.\n“This is what they’re always accusing us of,” my father said. The they in question doesn’t matter. There’s always a they. “If someone gets in our face, we use the law. We use money. Very different from a ‘fuck you’ and punch to the teeth.”\nThe entire premise of my novel spirals round this idea. When our protagonist, Arthur, discovers he’s part of an ancient line of fantastical Jewish demon hunters, his first response isn’t excitement, but incredulity. “There’s something sexy about a demon-hunting priest,” he muses. “The righteous man of the collar hunting vampires and things that go bump in the night, armed only with his cross, his faith, and a precious vial of holy water. Yet you take that same religious man and call him a Rabbi, arm him with a shofar and Hebrew, and what was once a haunting tale turns comical in the telling.” Jews can’t be demon hunters because that’d mean they have to be cool first.\nThe current of Jewish emasculation runs deep. In his speech to the Second Zionist Congress in 1898, Max Nordau spoke of the need for a new “muscular Jew.” For too long, the Jews had held up a mirror to themselves and saw the reflection the world gave them: passive. Atrophied. We were once inheritors to the great strength of Samson and the Maccabees, but had gone soft. A new virility was needed. “We will develop wide chests, strong arms and legs,” Nordau said. “A brave look.” This, in contrast to the eydlkayt. The bleary-eyed scholar, gentle and wise. The pussy.\nThe Jewish story\nMuch has been made of the Jews as the “chosen people.” Critics use the phrase against us to suggest that we believe ourselves exalted over others. Rabbis have argued we are chosen not to rule, but that together with all people, facilitate a better tomorrow.\nI believe it’s not necessarily Jews, but the Jewish story that is chosen. More than science or faith, narrative is the best tool for meaning-making that all human beings have, and ours is one for the ages. Jewish struggles teach to love the stranger. Jewish triumphs are tales of resilience and hope. For thousands of years we have offered ourselves up as the great story in the hopes others might study it and be better for it. But in the wake of October 7th, many Jews no longer have a stomach for forbearance. We have put our faith in learning and in education, in letters. Yet fresh images of our dead children pile upon the old, and we wonder: why must it be their blood that teaches? Why must it be us on the stage, in the spotlight, our tragedies performed time after time as ritual for mankind?\nHistorically, American Jews have supported the Democratic Party and the ideas it espouses: diversity. Tolerance. Speaking truth to power. The old wisdom held it was these values in which we could take shelter. After all, protecting minorities included ourselves; we would only ever be as safe as our multicultural democracy. It’s not that we didn’t value security, or unity, or tradition, but that those who acted in their names historically did so at our expense. Which is why Trump’s recent crackdowns on collegiate antisemitism have cast a pall of ambivalence over American Jewry. For the first time, the sword of power swings down and it’s them, not us, under its shadow. Them the immigrant. Them the Muslim. And what’s more, the sword falls in our name.\nThe reversal intoxicates and terrifies us. A part of us cheers when our safety is made paramount. No diverse coalition. No hiding our needs behind universalism. This is our pain – ours – and we will end it ourselves. You mess with Jews, Jews mess back. We won’t wait until we’re dead for you to love us. We don’t need your love at all. We’re done asking for it.\nBut of course, we’re not ending the pain ourselves. Trump is. It’s not our sword, but his. Not our voice, our judgement. We are ceding it in the hopes that the blade will never turn on us, even when the others whispering in the president’s ear are antisemites. Are we so desperate to retch up our emasculation that we would arm the man who softened Jewish experiences during the Holocaust, who says nothing of sieg heils at his party convention or assumption of power, who tells us who is and isn’t one of our own? As Wesleyan University president Michael S. Roth recently opined, “these are our defenders?”\n“It isn’t good,” my father said.\n“What isn’t?” I asked.\n“The disappearing of these Hamas protestors. Swarming them on the street. No warrant. Throwing them down in Louisiana or wherever.”\nI agreed, but played devil’s advocate to coax more out. There’s some comfort in knowing a truth, but even more in hearing it echoed back to you.\n“Aren’t the President’s actions showing Jews mean business?” I suggested. “That we’re not wimps?”\nMy father shook his head.\n“If you’re playing ball and the other guy’s frustrating you, the solution isn’t to get the bully to steal the ball. Otherwise, the game’s up. Can’t change the rules of free speech or due process just to feel safer. That’s how Democracy itself goes down.”\n“Such sagely language, Dad,” I said. “Where’d you pick that wisdom up? Getting into scraps in Far Rockaway?”\nHe threw his hands behind his head.\n“Nah. I guess that came from shul.”"}

That regret over the stories never told struck a special chord, particularly as both VE (Victory in Europe) Day and, in America, Mother’s Day, approached.\nDuring the war and afterwards, my mother was involved in US economic intelligence activities. Before her death, she dropped a few hints about what she did. It was only as I researched her life decades later, however, that some details emerged, even as large holes remained.\nOn May 9, 1945, Germany surrendered. Just two months later, my mom, a single woman a few weeks short of her 26th birthday, was granted the equivalent of the military rank of captain and sent to Germany to work with the US occupation government. Her parents, Yiddish-speaking Orthodox Jewish immigrants who’d come to America from Eastern Europe before the First World War, were not happy.\nCharlotte Katz Millenson was one of the super-sharp graduates of New York City’s Hunter College back when it was a women-only school whose free tuition was a magnet to families struggling during the Great Depression. When Charlotte’s parents moved to Washington, DC so her dad to could take over a laundry business, she soon followed.\nI interviewed my mom and dad a couple of years before her death in 1993, a time when her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease made it difficult to speak at length. She mentioned something about analyzing intercepted economic messages where she was working prior to going overseas. Her Civil Service records, which I found in my research, told a more dramatic story. The blandly named Foreign Economic Administration that she joined in 1944 was charged with analyzing thousands of intercepted German communications to help guide Allied bombing raids on economic targets.\nIn 1945, Charlotte transferred to the War Department as a civilian “financial reports specialist.” Shortly after, she was given a pay raise, a rank, a uniform and flown to Frankfurt on a military transport. While working there, she photographed a white building that was the Military Government’s headquarters and formerly housed the headquarters of chemical company IG Farben. It wasn’t widely known then that Farben made the Zyklon B gas used for mass murder in the concentration camps. I wonder what my mother thought later looking at that picture.\nIn January 1946, Charlotte was transferred to Berlin. It was in Berlin that she participated in the interrogation of Albert Speer, the man Adolf Hitler appointed to oversee German’s wartime economy. That interrogation, my research showed, was part of a confidential US project designed both to evaluate the effectiveness of the Allied bombing and to gather German industrial secrets before the Russians could obtain them.\nWhat was it like for Charlotte to come face-to-face with Hitler’s Minister of Armaments and War, knowing the massive destruction wreaked by those armaments? What questions was she allowed to ask? Meanwhile, there’s a photo of my mom posing with a Russian soldier, his left arm around her shoulder, both smiling, as he guarded the ruins of the bunker where Hitler committed suicide days before the war’s end. What were her feelings standing at the entrance to the Führerbunker, literally walking in Hitler’s footsteps? One more untold story. And there were others.\nThough I obviously can’t know for sure why my mom didn’t speak more and in more detail about her experiences, I have some guesses. There was, naturally, the confidentiality component, even years later. Moreover, my mom was often reticent to talk too much about herself; my dad was more the raconteur.\nBut I also think there may have been more personal reasons. After the war, it took Charlotte a while to land a job that wasn’t secretarial. Then, after a few years as a junior economist at the World Bank, she met my father, got married and had my sister, brother and me. Her full-time job became raising three smart, verbal, difficult children on the modest salary of a husband working for the government and a non-profit. It was by no means easy. She did it well and with love. Yet part of her, I think now, remained frustrated. One reason Charlotte may have been reluctant to share more stories about her experiences may have been because of the memories they conjured at a time when “housewife” was the only role she could play.\nIn  the song “Free Man in Paris,” Joni Mitchell sings: “I was a free man in Paris, I felt unfettered and alive.” My mom was, indeed, free in Paris, visiting there twice with friends, and, as a surviving letter to her mom shows, did feel “unfettered and alive,” as the song put it. It was the same in Germany. As Atina Grossman writes in the book Jews, Germans and Allies: Close Encounters in Occupied Germany, for the young men and women in the Military Government, this was “the great adventure of their lives.” Enjoying the benefits of dominance and affluence in a defeated nation, there were dates and parties, “drinking and playing and romancing.”\nI value what I uncovered about Charlotte as an intelligence analyst, and, like those interviewed in the documentary series, wish I’d known more. Had there been more time ­– if she hadn’t fallen ill, if we had reached the point in our lives where we knew better what to ask and how to listen – it might have been different. But the influence that continues to resonate throughout my life is from the love that came from Charlotte Katz Millenson, mom."}

Personally, I find podcasts to be great company during the mundane moments of daily life — whether I’m driving, folding laundry, or chopping vegetables. One of my favorites is “Honestly,” with Bari Weiss, who brings thoughtful and provocative voices to the table. Recently, she interviewed Douglas Murray, a fierce and articulate defender of Israel. During their conversation, she referred to his appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience.” For those unfamiliar, Joe Rogan is one of the most popular podcasters in the world, with over 14 million listeners. With a long afternoon of cooking ahead of me, I queued up the 2.5 hour episode as background for my slicing and stirring.\nIn that episode, Murray joined comedian and political commentator Dave Smith for what was intended to be a civil and productive conversation about the Israel-Hamas war. Predictably, Smith accused Israel of committing genocide and war crimes, painting vivid images of starving children and crying infants trapped beneath Gaza’s rubble. Murray countered with facts and historical context, noting, for example, that the combatant-to-civilian death ratio in this war is lower than in most other modern conflicts. But Smith, instead of engaging with the data, responded emotionally. He asked Murray if he had children, implying that no parent could ever justify what Israel was doing — regardless of military necessity or moral complexity.\nThis line of argument is not new. What struck me, however, was something that was missing — not just from this debate, but from so many others like it. No one talks about the young Israeli soldiers. No one mentions the 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds who would rather be studying in university, learning Torah in yeshiva, going to parties, standing up for social justice, or even just arguing about politics with their family and friends. These are young men and women who generally do not want to put on uniforms, pick up weapons, and enter urban war zones. They do not really want to spend these days of their youth blowing up buildings, destroying property, or facing the trauma of combat.\nBut they do it.\nThey serve because they must — because their families, their friends, and their homeland depend upon them. They are not aggressors; they are defenders. They didn’t start this war, and they pray every day for it to end. They wear their uniforms not out of hatred, but out of love: love for their people, love for their land, and love for the future they hope to help build.\nThirty-eight years ago, my sister-in-law and brother-in-law, Judy and Baruch Sterman, made aliyah and settled in Efrat. Despite the 5,700 miles between us, our families have always remained close, showing up for each other at joyful simchas and at more difficult times. Judy and Baruch are blessed with six sons and one daughter.\nAt the start of this war, three of the Sterman children were called up for service. Eyal, the youngest of the crew, had just completed his training and was serving in Yahalom, an elite combat engineering unit. He later became an officer. It was hard for us to wrap our heads around the idea that our sweet, smiley, good-natured, and still-very-young nephew was now a commander in the Israeli army.\nOne of our favorite memories of Eyal is from the bar mitzvah of one of his older brothers. On Friday night, he stood in the middle of his parents’ living room and practiced singing “Anim Zemiros,” which he would recite the next morning during the synagogue service, with such excitement and heart. He was just a little boy then; how could that same child now be leading other young men into combat? We were so proud of him, and, of course, deeply worried. The fear that something could happen to him, or to his brothers, was constant.\nAs the war went on, Eyal’s brothers eventually completed their reserve duty and returned home, some of that constant anxiety lifted.\nTwo weeks ago, however, we received the devastating news that Eyal had been hit by a sniper in Gaza. At first, we didn’t know how serious his injury was. A fellow soldier on a tank had been shot, and Eyal, without hesitation, ran up onto the tank to help him. That’s when the sniper’s bullet struck his left arm. He fell backwards into the tank, hitting his head, but even so, he managed to apply a tourniquet to his own wounded arm and send a WhatsApp message calling for help.\nDespite his bravery and the quick response, Eyal’s injury was severe. His arm had to be amputated below the elbow.\nSince that day, Eyal has been surrounded by unwavering love and support from his parents, his siblings, and his extended family in the IDF. His courage and resilience have touched the hearts of people from all backgrounds and communities. In his merit, the Book of Tehillim (Psalms) has been recited around the world, tzedakah (charity) has been given, challah has been baked, and countless acts of kindness have been performed. During his time in the hospital, Eyal attended the funeral of another fellow soldier. The emotional pain and the physical loss would seem to be too much to bear for anyone — how can a young person heal inside and out?\nEyal’s is one story, our family’s story, but sadly, his is far from the only one. There are so many families carrying stories like his. Stories of sons, daughters, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews. Young people should be exploring life, not fighting for it. Young people deserve more out of life. They do not deserve the physical and constant emotional sacrifices that the Hamas terrorists and their allies have forced upon us.\nWhen podcasters and news reporters speak about war, when they debate politics or report the latest headlines, do they ever stop to think about the human beings behind the IDF uniforms? The young men and women of the IDF are not faceless figures in a conflict; they are beloved children, siblings, and friends. They are students, dreamers, musicians, and Torah learners. They are people like Eyal, who ran into danger to save someone else. As the world debates Israel’s right to defend itself, let’s remind the world of the emotional and physical cost borne by its holy defenders. Their stories need to be told and heard."}
{"website": "timesofisrael", "url": null, "link": "https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/saying-thank-you-is-not-just-polite-but-holy/", "title": "Saying thank you is not just polite, but holy", "media_type": "blog", "date": "MAY 9, 2025, 3:13 PM", "content": "A few months ago, I noticed that my kids often weren’t saying thank you to people in service roles — baristas, cab drivers, librarians. I tried gentle reminders with mixed results. So one day, I sat them down and explained a concept from Jewish tradition: Kiddush Hashem.\nThe phrase literally means “sanctifying God’s name.” When people observe a committed Jew living with integrity, the Talmud explains, they should declare: “Fortunate is his teacher; fortunate is his God.”\nThis reframe changed everything. Now, when we leave a store or step out of a cab, I whisper “Kiddush Hashem” to my kids and they light up. They say thank you with real gusto, even a sense of purpose.\nAt first, I was just grateful it worked. Only later did I begin to understand why.\n* * *\nI’ve never found “holy” to be a particularly usable word. When someone dies, we speak of them as kind, generous, principled — but rarely as holy. Holiness tends to register as irrational or out of reach.\nThe anthropologist Richard Shweder describes the “ethic of divinity” as a framework in which human beings are seen not just as autonomous individuals, but as vessels of the sacred. In much of the West, this ethic has faded. In its place is the ethic of autonomy: be yourself, and do no harm. In such a framework, holiness is almost unintelligible.\nYet, in the heart of Leviticus — at the beginning of this week’s second Torah portion, Kedoshim — the Torah delivers one of its most radical commands: “You shall be holy.” Not as a dream or as an ideal, but as a duty.\nFor years, I searched Leviticus for echoes of modern sensibilities — the social justice of caring for the vulnerable, loving your neighbor, building a just society. But lately, I’ve been drawn to the ways Leviticus doesn’t fit our categories — the demands it makes that feel unfamiliar or uncomfortable. I’ve begun to ask more seriously: What does it mean to be holy? And why does the Torah demand it?\nThe Hebrew word for holiness — kodesh — is notoriously difficult to translate. It shows up across the Jewish tradition in strikingly different contexts. Shabbat is kadosh, set apart from the six ordinary days that precede it. A marriage is formalized through kiddushin, a ritual that sanctifies exclusivity. In synagogue, we recite kedusha, one of our most central prayers, proclaiming God’s holiness. The opposite of kodesh isn’t evil. It’s hol — mundane, everyday.\nAt the beginning of Kedoshim, Rashi defines holiness as separation from immorality, particularly in sexual conduct. Nachmanides goes further, arguing that holiness means elevating what is permitted — not living coarsely, even when we technically could. The Sages in the Midrash take it in another direction: kedusha means imitating divine traits.\nWith so many definitions, holiness can seem too vague to be useful. But I don’t think it is. My claim is this: despite the diversity of interpretations, there is a thread that runs through nearly every use of the term. Holiness marks something as consequential. Kedusha is what we call something when it matters at a different level.\nShabbat isn’t holy because the weekdays are profane. It is holy because it gestures toward something beyond — a rhythm that interrupts our ownership of time. A marriage isn’t holy because other relationships are meaningless. It is holy because it binds two people in a covenant that is especially consequential.\nAnd the radical claim of our Torah portion is that this can happen not just with sacred rituals, but in nearly any domain of life. Kedusha rests on the belief that everything can be elevated and made meaningful. That we can consecrate conversation, intimacy, even commerce.\nThe Torah’s exhortation of “Kedoshim tiheyu” — You shall be holy — is not a spiritual status we inherit. It’s a charge. A possibility. We can choose to make something holy. The Torah’s version of holiness is one of the most human-affirming ideas we have inherited: that God has given us the ability to make ordinary things matter.\nAnd that, I think, is what Kedoshim is trying to teach us. Holiness isn’t a feeling. It isn’t a private spiritual state, or a label reserved for religious virtuosos. Kedusha is treating life like it matters — the belief that our time can become sacred.\n* * *\nWhich brings me back to my kids. I had thought they weren’t saying thank you because they didn’t know better. But maybe they were just waiting to be told that their small actions matter. That something as quick as a thank you really makes a difference.\nC.S. Lewis once wrote: “How little people know who think that holiness is dull. When one meets the real thing, it is irresistible.”\nHoliness makes life feel thick with purpose. When we encounter the real thing, we don’t want to walk away."}
{"website": "timesofisrael", "url": null, "link": "https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/what-can-rob-lowe-teach-us-about-israel/", "title": "What can Rob Lowe teach us about Israel?", "media_type": "blog", "date": "MAY 7, 2025, 12:47 PM", "content": "I’m a child of the ’80s. I know the soundtrack to Pretty in Pink better than I know my kids’ phone numbers. Back in the day, my walls were plastered with Michael J. Fox and Kirk Cameron “pin-ups,” carefully removed from the middle of Teen Beat. So when I heard about a game show hosted by Brat Pack poster boy Rob Lowe, I was the first to jump on the couch to give it a try. Little did I realize how that bid for nostalgia would end up illuminating some key differences between American and Israeli culture.\nIf you’ve yet to see it, The Floor is a quiz show where players stand on squares in a giant grid. Each contestant picks their category — like Furry Animals, Flags, or ’80s TV shows — and defends their square of territory by competing in head-to-head duels with their neighbors. Win the duel, steal the square. The player with the most territory at the end wins $250,000.\nOnce our family started watching, we realized the challenge is more about speed than smarts. Identifying a glass of water in the Beverage category or the Nike logo in the Corporations category kept us entertained for a bit, as did Lowe’s charm and looks. But neither were compelling enough for long-term loyalty. Just when we were ready to move on, we discovered that Israel had launched its own version of The Floor — and suddenly, we were all in again.\nI thought that HaZira, or The Arena, would help us learn random Hebrew words like “armadillo” or “carbonated.” But there was nothing random about the interactions, categories, and atmosphere of HaZira. Watching it alongside The Floor gave us a crash course in cultural contrasts.\nLet’s start with the hosts, for example. Lowe is friendly, but reserved with the contestants. He aims to connect more with the audience, like with a knowing look to the camera when a contestant doesn’t recognize a movie he starred in, or a “complaint” that People never chose him as its Sexiest Man Alive. He’ll banter with the prettier contestants, but most players get a polite handshake and a formal “Good luck,” as they come and go off the stage. After a contestant wins a tough round, Lowe offers something simple, like “Nicely done,” while the camera pans to contestants watching quietly from their spots on the floor. \nThe contestants follow Lowe’s lead, with comments that sound scripted by ChatGPT: “I came to win!” or “That was intense.” Since you don’t get a lot of genuine emotion or natural humor, the game’s atmosphere feels more like a waiting room than a living room. \nUnlike Lowe, HaZira’s host, Reshef Levi, engages with the contestants like a nosy neighbor. When a contestant whose day job is a delivery driver comes up on stage, Levi ribs him, “Are you sure you know the way? You’re not going to get lost, right?” The contestant banters back, “I’ll find the address before you find a good punchline!” Meanwhile, another contestant from the floor yells out, “Stop talking, I’m so nervous for him!” Everyone laughs together.\nBoth HaZira players and Levi make unscripted jokes. Levi often addresses the loser of a round before congratulating the winner. And winners often hug their opponent with a loud “Kol HaKavod,” in appreciation, as the rest of the players cheer them off the stage. \nLevi also isn’t your typical heartthrob game show host. He is best known as a writer and producer behind some of Israel’s most iconic movies and TV shows, and was also the official playwright of HaBima, Israel’s national theater. One of his biggest TV hits is HaBorer (The Arbitrator), about a crime family whose boss settles underworld disputes by quoting Torah passages. The show became a cultural phenomenon in Israel — and is one of my personal favorites.\nWhile Lowe grew up in a fairly conventional family in Ohio, Levi’s family embodies the struggles and triumphs of Israel’s history. Levi’s father, an immigrant from Yemen, joined the Hagana and other pre-state Jewish defense groups as a teenager. The British jailed Eliyahu Levi when he was 16, and later deported him to an internment camp in Carthago, Sudan. Reshef Levi is one of eight children and has seven children himself. He created a series called Carthago with one of his brothers about their father’s personal story, which he says left a lasting imprint on his upbringing. Another of his brothers, Regev, died when both were in their early 20s, just starting their careers. To honor this brother, Levi signs his written works with the name “Reshef v’Regev Levi,” instead of just his own. \nThese acts of remembrance say so much about Levi himself, but also reflect the deeper cultural contrasts that show up in HaZira. Like how it’s perfectly acceptable for the contestants to wear anything from shorts and t-shirts to Jewish star necklaces to a kippah and even payos. Or how a Haredi contestant might face off against a tattooed guy in a tie-dyed shirt. The winner might go up against a gay, Christian Arab whose family came as refugees from the Lebanese civil war and who works as a pro-Israel advocate. On the other hand, most of the Americans on The Floor come in a uniform of brightly colored clothes likely dictated by producers. Their makeup looks perfect, but we don’t learn anything about their personal family histories.\nThe categories contestants choose also say a lot about each culture. Where The Floor categories are often sterile like “Dog Breeds” or “US Presidents,” HaZira’s more culturally personal categories include “Mizrahi Divas” and “Army Slang.” Answers in the “Holidays” category include Simchat Torah, Sukkot, and Tu B’Shvat. These categories don’t just require knowing random — and often pretty obvious — facts. They require shared experiences and history you can only understand if you’ve lived them. \nIt’s that feeling of connection that’s at the heart of the difference between Israeli and American culture. Where Americans often value individualism, surface-level interactions, and glossy looks, Israelis tend to prioritize community, directness, and stories that reflect real struggle and resilience.\nAmerican style is easier, but it doesn’t typically lead to closeness. Rob Lowe wants you to know about — and maybe even be jealous of — his accomplishments and good looks. Reshef Levi wants you to know about his father’s — and Israel’s — struggle for freedom. He wants to share his success with his late brother. It’s no wonder the US faces an epidemic of loneliness, but Israel does not.\nThis is the difference that sets Israeli culture apart, as Dan Senor and Paul Singer describe in The Genius of Israel. They highlight how emotional honesty, deep personal bonds, and a sense of shared purpose are what keep Israelis moving forward in the face of existential threat. Senor and Singer interview Lior Raz, creator of the hit show, Fauda, who emphasizes how important personal connection is: “Stories are everywhere in this country. It’s how we cope. It’s how we make sense of things.”\nMaybe that’s why someone who writes and produces stories for a living is better able to connect with his on-stage and off-stage audiences than someone who reads scripted lines for a living — even if he does have the prettier face.\nSo sure, I came for Rob Lowe and ’80s nostalgia. But I uncovered a profound lesson: authenticity runs way deeper than even the most sparkly façade. Israel reminds us that the best stories aren’t the most polished ones. They’re the ones we share together."}

One who loves others", "media_type": "blog", "date": "MAY 9, 2025, 2:48 PM", "content": "The fundamental principle of the Torah, according to Rabbi Akiva (Sifra Kedoshim 2), is love of the other: “Love thy neighbor as thyself” (Lev. 19:18). Yet it seems that most of us have the inverse wish: for the other to love us. The path laid down by Rabbi Akiva, as this short story by Hermann Hesse will show, is the way to happiness:\nThere was once an expectant woman who sought out a pious man to bless the fetus in her womb. The pious man promised the woman to bless her with the blessing of her choice, and she asked that all of the child’s acquaintances love it. The pious man hesitated, and asked her if she was certain about her choice of blessing. But when she insisted, he blessed the fetus as she requested. The woman gave birth to a boy, and the blessing was fulfilled: everyone loved the child. Yet, that love made them pardon his bad behavior, and he grew up to become corrupt. One day, he discovered the source of his misery and went to the pious man to reverse the blessing: rather than be loved by all, he asked to love all. Thus he became a happy man.\nA similar point is made by Orson Welles in his seminal film Citizen Kane, whose titular character grows up parentless and becomes immensely wealthy. Throughout his adult life, he uses his money to gain popularity, but ultimately dies alone in his colossal mansion, a single last word on his lips: “Rosebud.” The film follows the doomed efforts of a journalist to find out who or what is “rosebud.” In the end, we learn that “rosebud” is a small object from Kane’s childhood, the sole thing to which he was truly connected.\nIt is a secret known to every parent: generally speaking, parents express love for their children far more than the other way around. Usually it is the parent who is the lover and the children who are loved, yet the exquisite pleasure of this love is experienced by the parent.\nTrue love has value in itself, and when it is not authentic it is worthless. This is an insight that informs our behavior in many ways. Often, people will act or refrain from action, consciously or not, out of concern for their popularity. But when we are guided by commitment to loving rather than being loved, we are free to do the right thing, even if it is unpopular.\nWho Is Loved? One Who Loves Others\nThe truth is that in order to be loved one must love. As the story goes, Rabbi Hayim of Volozhin and his students once had to traverse a dangerous forest. At one point they were accosted and surrounded by brigands who informed them that they were going to steal their money and then murder them. Rabbi Hayim asked the robbers to give him and his students a few minutes to prepare for death, during which he stared into the face of the band’s leader. Soon, the leader yelled, “Run!” and Rabbi Hayim and his students escaped. When his students asked him how he had effected such a miracle, he replied, “When the brigands told us they would murder us, I was filled with anger and hate. But I did not want to leave this world feeling anger and hate, so, in order to overcome those emotions, I forced myself to empathize with the brigands. It appears that no one had ever looked at their leader with such an emotion, for he was unable to harm us.”\nThis insight also appears in Proverbs: “As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man” (27:19). Rashi explains in his commentary on the Talmud (Yevamot 117a): “As with the water that one observes and sees in it a face that is like one’s own – when one smiles it smiles and when he frowns it frowns – so, too, the heart of one human to another human; if one loves the other, the other loves one back.”\nLove for Near and Far\nChristianity took Judaism to task over the verse “Love thy neighbor as thyself,” claiming that it limited the recipients of love to one’s neighbors while, clearly, such love should be extended to all of humanity. That claim is refuted in the same chapter, when the Torah explicitly writes, “And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land…thou shalt love him as thyself” (Lev. 19:33–34). The stranger and the neighbor are mentioned in separate verses in order to give voice to the understanding that love begins from the natural, closer sphere and extends outward from there – from the near to the far.[1]\nIndeed, some people get stuck in the first stage, their love doomed to remain confined within their immediate circle, but it seems that trying to bypass that stage only exacerbates the problem. Absent love for those who are close to us, “love for all” can become an empty, sanctimonious slogan rather than an expression of authentic emotion. The fully egalitarian approach is often permeated with alienation. As the journalist Yair Sheleg once asked: how is it that the more a society talks about humanism, the more its members are alienated from one another?\nThe truth is, the verse teaches us that love must begin even closer to home. The Torah tells us to love the other like “ourselves,” meaning that self-love comes first. People who are not at peace with themselves, who hate and do not accept themselves, will ultimately treat the other in the same vein.\nI Am the Lord\nThe verse that enjoins to “love thy neighbor as thyself” ends with the phrase “I am the Lord.” What is the connection between loving the other and God? According to the Zohar, God is present whenever there is love among friends:\nThose companions, when they sit as one, not separating from each other…. What does the Holy One say? “Look, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell gam yaĥad,” “also together!” – gam, also, including Shekhina with them. Furthermore, the blessed Holy One listens to their utterances and is pleased and delights with them…and for your sake, peace will prevail in the world, as it is written, “For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, ‘Peace be within thee’ (Ps. 122:8).” (Zohar, Aĥarei Mot 59b)\nIn Mishna Avot (3:24), Rabbi Akiva – he who enshrined “love thy neighbor” as the quintessential Torah precept – teaches that “beloved is man, since he is created in the image [of God]. A deeper love – it is revealed to him that he is created in the image, as it says (Gen. 9:6): ‘For in the image of God made He man.’” God’s special affection for humanity is due to its divine dimension, having been created in His image. God dwells within every human being."}

My name is Hallel, and I’m a liberal Zionist activist. I had a safe, legal abortion here in Israel two months ago. So yeah, we’re going to get into it—quickly and unapologetically.\nBecause lately, I’ve seen something deeply concerning: the way abortion rights are being linked with slogans like “Free Palestine” on protest signs, clinic doors, and Instagram carousels. At first glance, it might seem progressive, intersectional, or even brave to the average scroller. But let me be clear—it’s not just confusing. It’s harmful.\nAbortion Clinics Should Be Safe Spaces—Not Political Battlegrounds\nAbortion access is a human right. It’s a critical part of healthcare that must be safe, legal, and accessible to *everyone*. Clinics should be sanctuaries—places where women can make decisions about their bodies without fear, shame, or politicization.\nWhen you slap “Free Palestine” on the front of an abortion clinic, you’re not making that space more inclusive. You’re making it political. And politics—especially when they carry deeply divisive or weaponized rhetoric—have no place in a space meant to prioritize safety and bodily autonomy for all.\nBecause here’s the truth: Muslim women, Jewish women, Israeli women, Palestinian women, women of every identity and belief system—*all women*—need access to reproductive care. And when you politicize that access, you alienate some of the very people you claim to fight for.\nLet’s Talk About the Facts\nHere in Israel, abortion is legal. It’s safe. It’s accessible. There are committees, yes, but nearly all requests are approved. I’m living proof of that. I had access to the care I needed without shame or obstruction.\nUnder the Palestinian Authority? Under Hamas? That care doesn’t exist. Abortion is heavily restricted, if not outright illegal. There are no exceptions for rape. None for incest. None for fetal abnormalities. There’s almost no medical infrastructure, no systemic support. Women often resort to unsafe procedures—if they’re even able to find any option at all.\nSo when I see slogans like “Fund Abortion, Not War” or activists in red triangle t-shirts claiming solidarity with oppressed women by pushing a false narrative that erases the real conditions on the ground, it’s not just annoying. It’s dangerous.\nThat’s not solidarity.\nThat’s not activism.\nIt’s slacktivism.\nIt’s Western, Instagrammable, out-of-touch, and self-serving.\nMy Jewish Values Are Pro-Choice\nJudaism is clear: the life and health of the woman come first. Jewish law doesn’t just allow for abortion—it mandates it when the mother’s life is at risk. And in a world where women’s rights are constantly under siege, that clarity matters.\nI’m proud to say I accessed safe abortion care in the Jewish state. And I’m horrified that, during the same month, women across the United States were being denied that same right. That girls were bleeding out in hospital waiting rooms because doctors were too afraid to treat them. That people were watching their daughters suffer because saving them could cost a physician their license.\nSo if you really care about reproductive rights—about autonomy, about equity—then I ask you to pause. Reflect. And stop using abortion access as a backdrop for your unrelated political agenda.\nBecause no woman should feel unsafe walking into a clinic.\nNot because of protesters on the right screaming Bible verses—and not because of performative allies on the left projecting slogans that erase or distort complex realities.\nIf you want to support women’s rights? Start by making clinics safe again—for *everyone*. That includes Jews.\nAnd as for the rest of your gimmicks?\nThe tees. The slogans.\nThe lazy performance.\nYou can keep them.\nThey’re not helping anyone."}

He was kidnapped from his base during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led onslaught that started the war in Gaza. He is set to be the first male soldier to be released.\nIn a statement, Hamas said the decision to release Alexander came after recent talks with US officials and “intensified efforts to achieve a ceasefire, open border crossings, and allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt did not say when Alexander would be released. The officials who spoke with The Times of Israel said that — contrary to Hamas’s claim — no direct talks were held between the terror group and the US.\nHamas in its statement also said that it was prepared to enter intensified negotiations aimed at reaching a final agreement to end the war, establish a mutually “agreed prisoner exchange, and enable Gaza to be administered by an independent professional authority.”\nHamas uses the term “prisoner exchange” to refer to the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian security prisoners, including terrorists convicted of murdering Israelis.\nPalestinian security inmates released by Israel as part of a hostage release-ceasefire deal with Hamas are welcomed by family members as they arrive on buses to the European hospital in Khan Younis on February 1, 2025.

I look very much forward to that day of celebration!”\nQatar and Egypt welcomed the news in a joint statement, calling it “a gesture of goodwill and an encouraging step toward a return to the negotiating table to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, the release of prisoners and detainees, and ensure the safe and unhindered flow of aid to address the tragic conditions in the Strip.”\nThe US did not brief Israel on the effort to release Alexander until after the deal with Hamas was reached, the source familiar with the details of Alexander’s release told The Times of Israel.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsrael was generally aware that efforts were ongoing, but only knew about them from its own intelligence operations.

(Photo by Jim WATSON / AFP)\nNetanyahu’s office confirmed that the US had informed Israel that Hamas would release Alexander “without any compensation or conditions,” and as a gesture of goodwill to the US.\n“The US conveyed to Israel that this move is expected to lead to negotiations for the release of additional hostages, based on the original Witkoff proposal — which Israel has already accepted,” said the PMO in a statement, referring to a framework that sources have told The Times of Israel was in fact proposed by Israel, under which around half the living hostages would go free in exchange for an extended truce, with the rest being later freed in exchange for an end to the war.\nIsrael was making preparations for the potential release, the PMO continued, adding that “according to Israeli policy, the negotiation will take place under fire, with a firm commitment to achieving all the objectives of the war.”\nEarlier Sunday, multiple reports quoted Netanyahu as telling the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that Hamas could release Alexander during Trump’s visit, and welcomed the possibility, adding: “These are very critical days.”\nA protester holds up a cutout of Edan Alexander’s face at a rally calling for the release of the hostages, at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, March 15, 2025. (Avshalom Sassoni/Flash90)\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement Sunday that the release of Alexander “must be the start of a single agreement that will return all 59 hostages.”\n“There is only one moral, proper and necessary agreement: the immediate return of all the hostages and the end of the war,” said the forum, which has long been calling for the government to agree to a deal that will return all the remaining hostages at once, rather than in phases.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Now is the time to bring about a breakthrough in negotiations. The responsibility lies with the Israeli government,” it added. “Nobody can be left behind.”\nTerror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 59 hostages, including 58 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023. They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF.\nHamas released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals — and the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives during a ceasefire between January and March. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. In exchange, Israel has freed some 2,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners, and Gazan terror suspects detained during the war.\nEight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014.\nThe body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt. Hadar Goldin, is still being held by Hamas, and is counted among the 59 hostages.\nAgencies contributed to this report."}

Since Ben Gurion was hit, most foreign airlines have suspended flights to Israel.\nThe fiery reprisals destroyed the international airport in the capital Sanaa, and caused heavy damage to a port in Hodeida and several power stations and a cement factory, officials said.\nThe Houthis — whose slogan calls for “Death to America, Death to Israel, [and] a Curse on the Jews” — first began attacking Israel and maritime traffic in November 2023, a month after the October 7 Hamas massacre.\nThe Houthis held their fire when a ceasefire was reached between Israel and Hamas in January 2025. By that point, they had fired over 40 ballistic missiles and dozens of attack drones and cruise missiles at Israel, including one that killed a civilian and wounded several others in Tel Aviv in July, prompting Israel’s first strike in Yemen.\nSince March 18, when the IDF resumed its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis have launched some 29 ballistic missiles and at least 10 drones at Israel.\nThe sirens warning of missile attacks have sent hundreds of thousands of Israelis rushing to shelters at all hours of the day and night."}

The Houthi missile impacted in a grove of trees alongside an access road close to Terminal 3, several hundred yards from the airport control tower.\n“We are facing a situation where a missile that fell in Ben Gurion Airport could have just as easily fallen a little bit to the left or the right and could have hit an aircraft or a terminal, and that could have had a catastrophic effect,” Adv. Shirly Kazir, head of aviation & tourism practices at law firm FISCHER (FBC) told The Times of Israel. “So foreign airlines are obviously fearful, but even if airlines are willing to consider resuming flights to Israel when the situation calms down a bit, safety and the issue of pricing of insurance premiums come up once again.”\nKazir, who represents 20 foreign airlines operating in Europe and the US, said that the carriers want to resume flight services to Tel Aviv, but for that to happen, they will need more certainty and flexibility on the regulatory situation in Israel to ease costs and financial risk if they have to halt operations again because of the security situation.\nSign up for the Tech Israel Daily\nand never miss Israel's top tech stories\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“If it’s important for Israel to have the asset of foreign airlines flying to Israel, there are solutions the Transportation Ministry can advance that wouldn’t be too costly and that could make a shift in the airlines’ decision,” said Kazir, who has been representing foreign airlines in a proposal to make amendments to the 2012 Aviation Services Law, which protects consumer rights of passengers whose flights have been canceled.\nSmoke in the area of Ben Gurion Airport after a ballistic missile was fired at Israel from Yemen on May 4, 2025 (Screen grab from social media used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)\nAfter the rocket impact near the airport — which followed failed Israeli and American attempts to shoot it down — the Houthis boasted of their success and claimed that Ben Gurion Airport was “no longer safe for air travel.” The Yemen-based terror group threatened to “blockade” Israel’s airspace.\n“The fact that a missile managed to infiltrate and hit around Ben Gurion Airport caused a lot of concern,” said Eyal Doron, partner and head of the aviation department at law firm S. Horowitz & Co. “Had it fallen someplace else, far away from the airport for example, in an open area in the Negev desert, I’m not sure it would have caused such substantive material reaction by foreign airlines.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nInitially, many foreign carriers suspended flights to Israel for short periods of a day or two, while monitoring the situation daily. But by the end of last week, the list of airlines deciding to stay away for longer expanded. Some foreign airlines are postponing their return for weeks or months and, in some cases, indefinitely.\nIn response, the Transportation Ministry said that the government and aviation authorities are continuously working with foreign airlines to bring them back and restore flight services.\nAs of now, the Lufthansa Group — which includes German carrier Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, and Eurowings — has said it will not resume flights to Tel Aviv until May 19. Air India, which operates a direct route between Israel and India, has suspended flights until May 25. US carriers United and Delta airlines have halted flights until May 18 and May 20 respectively. Iberia will not resume flights until June 1, and British Airways not until June 15.\nAmong low-cost airlines, Wizz Air canceled flights until May 14, and Ryanair until May 21. UK carrier Virgin Atlantic at the end of April ceased direct flight services between London and Tel Aviv, after previously pausing the route amid the war.\nAccording to Kazir and Doron, recent flight suspensions by foreign airlines are based on similar considerations that have guided them throughout the war: safety considerations, risk management, insurance policy coverage and the refusal of flight crews to fly to Israel. They both cautioned that many foreign airlines halting their flight services will divert aircraft destined for Tel Aviv to other places, making it harder to resume service.\nAdv. Shirly Kazir, head of aviation & tourism practices at the FISCHER (FBC) law firm. (Courtesy of Ofir Abe)\n“If foreign airlines take their aircraft to a new route and a different destination, the chances of us getting them back for the summer period now are very low,” said Kazir. “Many clients I have, meaning foreign airlines, advise me in confidence that they are not resuming flights to Israel until the summer, which is horrific.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nMany of the airlines had only recently resumed services to Israel after they were canceled for much of the time since Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023, that started the war in Gaza. United had resumed flights in March, while Delta returned on April 1, and British Airways restarted its Israel flights on April 5.\n“Foreign airlines would like to fly to Israel, especially from a business point of view, as they’ve sold tickets [and] they don’t want August 2024 to happen again, faced with a situation where they have to deal with refunds and might again be sued by passengers,” said Doron.\n“Under the current situation, when nothing is clear, as we do not know what’s going to happen even next week, the State of Israel needs to convince foreign airlines that its airspace is safe, the airport is safe, and what happened a week ago was a very exceptional issue… No system is perfect, no system can give you 100% protection,” she said.\nWith foreign carriers absent, the supply of flights low and demand high, ticket prices will surge again, Doron and Kazir warned. Of the dozens of foreign airlines that dominated the local aviation market before the outbreak of war in Gaza, primarily Israeli carriers have maintained regular flight schedules amid the war. In recent days, Emirates, Abu Dhabi’s Etihad, and flydubai also continued flying despite the Houthi attack.\n“As foreign airlines cancel a flight, they already lose money because they can’t reallocate the airplane immediately, and then they have to refund passengers for the cost of the tickets or try to reroute them at a much higher cost — a monetary exposure they have faced throughout the war,” said Doron.\n“Many foreign airlines only resumed their Israel services in March, to end up in a situation where a couple of weeks later, flights are being canceled again, and they are again hit with ticket refunds and compensation. It’s not sustainable for a long time.”\nShe warned that “if the disruptions go on for a long time, my concern is that some airlines could decide that they are not coming back.”\nEarlier this year, Israeli lawmakers agreed to make legal changes to canceled flight compensation rights for air passengers to help ease the financial costs of disruptions to foreign carriers during the war period. The Knesset Economics Committee approved a proposal by foreign airlines to make amendments to the 2012 Aviation Services Law, which will restrict the terms and conditions of compensation paid by airlines to passengers in the event of flight cancellations during an emergency war period. The legal amendment was passed in a second and third reading in the Knesset in February.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDepending on the security situation, the Transportation Ministry, in consultation with the Economy Ministry, will be given the power and authority to temporarily suspend some of the compensation entitlements of consumers, such as limiting the obligation to provide accommodation in the event of a flight cancellation for up to two nights.\nAdv. Eyal Doron, partner and head of the aviation department at law firm S. Horowitz & Co. (Courtesy)\n“If foreign airlines [knew] that they have that flexibility from the Israeli regulation, it would give them more comfort to resume flight services, but for that to kick in, Israel needs to declare a special emergency situation,” said Kazir.\n“Foreign airlines want to know that they don’t sell flight tickets for ‘X’ amount, and then, in the case of cancellations, have to pay 10 times ‘X’.”\nDuring an emergency period, an airline that cancels all of its flights will also have options to offer passengers an alternative ticket, either from a different point of departure or to a different nearby destination such as Larnaca or Athens.\n“Airlines want to know that if they are not flying to Israel because of the security situation, they can bring passengers to nearby Cyprus or Greece instead of being exposed to massive costs that they would have to pay — to mostly Israeli airlines — to get passengers to their final destination in Tel Aviv,” said Kazir."}

It stressed that Israel did not agree to a ceasefire or to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Alexander — only to provide a safe corridor to allow for his release.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nBut this claim was rejected by Golan, who insisted that it was “not for nothing that Trump bypassed Netanyahu.

Even at the cost of human life.”\nEdan Alexander (left) with his family (from left to right): mother Yael, brother Roy, sister Mika, and father Adi. (Courtesy of Alexander family)\nTrump now understands that Netanyahu “is an obstacle to security and the release of the hostages,” Golan continued, asserting that occupying the Gaza Strip will only lead to more deaths and “economic devastation.”\nOpposition Leader Yair Lapid also criticized the government for allowing itself to be cut out of the loop, stating that it represented “a diplomatic failure with consequences that endanger the security and well-being of the entire State of Israel.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“This alliance [with the US] is the greatest strategic asset that the State of Israel has,” but while the Trump administration praises the Netanyahu government publicly, the “Americans are fed up with Netanyahu,” Lapid asserted.\n“The Trump administration is operating today without coordination and without listening to Netanyahu. They have reached a ceasefire with the Houthis in Yemen behind his back, are conducting dangerous negotiations with the Iranians, are promoting a Saudi nuclear program, and are making a hostage deal only for their own citizens,” Lapid said. “There has never been anything like this.”\n“Trump is a pro-Israel president. He loves Israel, but he hates dragging his feet, and postponements and delays, and hesitation, and lies,” Lapid continued. “He wants a ceasefire in Gaza, he wants a big hostage deal, he wants regional agreements that will help the American economy. Netanyahu does not know how to give him that. Not with this government.”\nYisrael Beytenu chairman Avigdor Liberman sounded a similar note, telling reporters that, “unfortunately, [Alexander’s] return is not happening as a result of Israeli pressure or a decision, but as a result of direct contact between the US and Hamas.”\nOpposition leader and Yesh Atid party head MK Yair Lapid speaks at a faction meeting in the Knesset on May 12, 2025. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nIsrael has “reached an unprecedented low” in its relations with the United States, Liberman argued, bemoaning “the [US] ceasefire with the Houthis when the State of Israel is left out of the agreement, the US president’s visit to the region when he skips Israel, [and] the direct negotiations between the US and Iran.”\nLast week, Trump announced that the US would stop bombing Yemen’s Houthis, after the Iran-backed group agreed to stop interrupting important shipping lanes in the Middle East.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe announcement did not mention the ongoing Houthi attacks on Israel, and a spokesman for the Yemeni rebel group pledged that such strikes would continue. Israeli officials told Hebrew media outlets that Washington did not give Jerusalem advance notice of the announcement, and that Israel was surprised by it.\nTrump also reportedly quashed Israeli proposals for a series of joint strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, opting instead to try for a diplomatic solution to the problem of Tehran’s nuclear program.\nThe Trump administration has sent mixed messages regarding Iran, stating both that it wants Tehran’s nuclear program completely destroyed and also insisting that it is open to letting the Islamic Republic pursue civilian nuclear energy.\nAt the same time, Trump is heading to the Middle East on Monday on a multi-country tour in which the US president will skip Israel, but will stop in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, leading government critics to warn that Jerusalem is being left out of Washington’s regional diplomatic initiatives.\nUS President Donald Trump takes questions outside the West Wing of White House in Washington, DC, on May 8, 2025. (Jim WATSON / AFP)\nAccording to Arabic media reports, Trump is also set to meet Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, and Syria’s de facto leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa.\nAnd despite previously insisting that Saudi Arabia will join the Abraham Accords— the series of normalization agreements that his previous administration brokered between Israel and several Arab states — Trump has reportedly dropped normalization with Israel as a condition for progress on Saudi Arabia’s civilian nuclear program.\nAgainst this backdrop, National Unity chairman Benny Gantz warned on Monday that Israel must get on board with American plans for the Middle East or be left behind.\nAddressing the press ahead of his party’s weekly faction meeting, Gantz said that “the American administration is determined to promote normalization with Saudi Arabia and other large and significant countries in the region.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Either we complete a strategic transformation, strengthen the axis against Iran, destroy its military nuclear capability, and become part of a vast comprehensive political move led by the United States in the region, or we will be left behind,” he warned. “The opportunity to change the Middle East must not be missed because of political considerations.”\n‘We must stop procrastinating and go on the offensive’\nFar-right members of Netanyahu’s coalition pushed back hard against such criticism, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich declaring, “You have to be crazy to turn an event like [Edan Alexander’s release] into something that is against the government.”\nFinance Minister Religious Zionist party head Bezalel Smotrich leads a faction meeting at the Knesset in Jerusalem, May 12, 2025. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\n“A heroic fighter, a lone soldier who came to Israel to enlist in the army and serve the homeland, is released from captivity without any compensation or conditions — we are not releasing a single terrorist, we are not delivering humanitarian aid, we are not stopping the war and we are not surrendering,” Smotrich told reporters in the Knesset ahead of his Religious Zionism party’s weekly faction meeting.\n“Just two months ago, there were those who were talking about how, in order to free Edan, we would have to release 250 murderous terrorists with blood on their hands,” but now he is being freed “because we have created military and political pressure on Hamas,” Smotrich claimed.\nHamas “understands that we have no intention of surrendering and if it wants something, it is the one who has to pay upfront and not the other way around,” he asserted — adding that the government is “committed to bringing about everyone’s release.”\nNational Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir also endorsed a more aggressive approach in Gaza, telling reporters that Israel had “received American backing to open the gates of hell on Gaza — we must stop procrastinating, and go on the offensive to defeat it.”\nIn an appeal to Netanyahu, Ben Gvir said that “President Trump gave us backing several months ago to open the gates of hell on Hamas, and we are delaying. We must stop delaying and launch the decisive attack. To occupy the entire territory of the Gaza Strip, and to encourage the migration of Gazans to countries around the world.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nSmotrich and Ben Gvir’s comments, however, appeared at odds with recent statements by senior American officials.\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff arrives for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin (not in picture) in Moscow, Russia, April 25, 2025.

We think very much alike, we have very similar objectives,” the US envoy said. “They don’t want to see a weaponized nuclear state in the state of Iran. And so, I don’t think there’s much daylight between how they think and how we think from a foreign policy perspective.”\nChannel 12 reported Sunday that Witkoff recently told hostages’ families that he disagrees with Israel’s approach to the war in the Strip, and believes that Israel is pointlessly extending the war when reaching a new ceasefire and hostage release deal is the correct next step to take.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsrael is planning to launch a major military offensive against Hamas in Gaza if no hostage deal is reached with the terror group by the end of Trump’s visit to the region.\nChannel 12 cited the families as saying they had not heard this kind of criticism of Israeli government policy from Witkoff in the past.\nFormer US ambassador to Israel David Friedman, who served under the first Trump administration, also asserted in an X post, “There is NO RIFT between President Trump and PM Netanyahu. There are those in both the US and Israel who would like to see such a rift, and they are feeding false accounts to the media to achieve just that. But it’s all fake.”\nCurrent US Ambassador Mike Huckabee tried to quell the rumors of tensions in interviews with Israeli networks Saturday, asserting that the US president was not snubbing Israel by skipping the Jewish state during his upcoming visit.\nJerusalem is reportedly unhappy with the ongoing US-Iran talks, which are said to be developing into a largely similar framework to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, which was signed by then-US president Barack Obama and was panned at the time by Netanyahu as disastrous for Israel.\nUnder the terms being discussed, according to reports, Iran would limit stockpile size and centrifuge types, and dilute, export, or seal its 60 percent uranium stock under unprecedented International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) scrutiny, in exchange for substantial sanctions relief.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis approach has not aligned with Netanyahu’s longtime position, which is that Israel will not allow Iran to attain nuclear weapons and is opposed to any talks that don’t lead Iran to agree to a “Libya-style agreement,” under which Tehran’s entire nuclear program — both military and civilian — would be dismantled completely.\nIn addition, Israel had not been made aware in advance of a recent deal signed between the US and the Houthi rebels in Yemen regarding a cessation of US bombing if the Iran-backed rebels stop firing on US shipping, which notably left the door open for Houthi strikes on Israel to go unabated.\nSecurity forces at the site where a missile fired from Yemen hit an area of Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, on May 4, 2025.(Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)\nThat deal was announced by Trump two days after a Houthi missile impacted the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport, a few hundred yards from the main control tower, lightly injuring several people and prompting most foreign airlines to halt flights to Israel.\nIsrael’s Channel 13 reported Sunday evening that people in Netanyahu’s inner circle have expressed unusually harsh criticism toward the Trump administration in recent weeks.\n“There’s chaos in the Trump administration — the right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing,” said a senior figure close to the premier, according to the report.\n“It’s not even clear if this has anything to do with us. Everything operates according to the president’s whims. Sometimes that works in our favor, and sometimes it doesn’t,” the source said.\nThe premier’s office also expressed disappointment in the White House through Dermer, during a meeting last Thursday between the top Netanyahu adviser and Trump, the report added.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn the US, Fox News also reported on the rift, citing analysts as saying Netanyahu stood as a “roadblock” to Trump’s diplomatic initiatives in the region, adding that Israel was not part of securing the expected release of US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, who was kidnapped during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led onslaught that started the war in Gaza.\nOfficials told The Times of Israel the move was a goodwill gesture by Hamas ahead of Trump’s Middle East visit, hoping that he will coax Israel to sign a deal freeing the remaining hostages in exchange for an end to the war."}

(Evan Vucci/AP)\nEstablishing ties has become especially toxic for Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered on October 7, 2023, when the Palestinian terror group Hamas led a devastating invasion of southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 taken as hostages to Gaza.\nAs such, the issue, central to bilateral talks in Trump’s first term, has effectively been delinked from economic and other security matters between Washington and the kingdom, according to six other sources Reuters spoke with for this story, including two Saudi and two US officials. The people all asked to remain anonymous to speak about sensitive diplomatic conversations.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSaudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, needs the Gaza war to end and a credible path to a Palestinian state “before he re-engages with the issue of normalization,” said Dennis Ross, a former US negotiator.\nIn the meantime, Washington and Riyadh will focus Trump’s trip largely on the economic partnership and other regional matters, according to the six sources. Lucrative investments such as major deals in arms, mega-projects and artificial intelligence are in play, officials from both sides stressed.\nThe approach was cemented in diplomatic talks between Saudi and US officials ahead of the trip, the first formal state visit of Trump’s second term, they said.\nTrump’s stated aim is to secure a trillion-dollar investment in US companies, building on an initial commitment of $600 billion pledged by the crown prince.\nThe wealthy kingdom, the world’s top oil exporter, knows the ritual well: dazzle the guest, secure the favor. The goal, the sources told Reuters, is to evade diplomatic landmines and perhaps, one said, to win concessions from Trump on the Gaza war and its aftermath.\nUS President Donald Trump, left, shakes hands with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he leaves the West Wing of the White House, April 7, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n“The Trump administration wants this trip to be a big deal. That means lots of splashy deal announcements and collaborations that can be sold as being good for America,” said Robert Mogielnicki, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute, a think tank in Washington.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Normalizing ties with Israel is a much heavier lift than rolling out the red carpet for President Trump and announcing investment deals,” he said.\nA State Department spokesperson declined to comment on any understanding reached ahead of the trip, saying Trump “will look to strengthen ties between the United States and our Arab Gulf partners during the visits.”\nThe Saudi government communications office did not reply to a request for comment.\nCourt the kingdom\nBefore Hamas launched its October 7 attacks on Israel, the crown prince was finalizing a landmark diplomatic agreement: a US defense pact in exchange for Riyadh recognizing Israel.\nBut the scale of Israel’s campaign to destroy Hamas, topple its Gaza regime, and free the hostages forced a pause in the talks.\nThe Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 50,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though the toll cannot be verified and does not differentiate between civilians and fighters.\nIsrael says it has killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.\nIn November last year, bin Salman accused Israel of genocide.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraeli troops operate in Gaza in a photo published by the IDF on May 9, 2025. (Israel Defense Forces)\nFrustrated by the impact of Gaza’s prolonged crisis on normalization efforts, Trump could use his visit to unveil a US framework to end the 18-month war, the two Gulf sources said.\nThe plan could create a transitional government and new security arrangements for postwar Gaza, potentially reshaping regional diplomacy and opening the door to future normalization talks, they said.\nUnderscoring the high-stakes diplomacy underway, Trump met privately with Israel’s Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer on Thursday to discuss the war and nuclear talks with Iran, Axios reported.\nThe US State Department did not immediately respond to questions about Trump’s discussions on Gaza.\nTrump conspicuously has not announced a visit to Israel as part of his tour of the region. Two diplomats noted the US president has recently refrained from talking about his “Gaza Riviera” plan, which enraged the Arab world with the suggestion of resettling the entire Gazan population and US ownership of the strip.\nIn the build-up to the trip, Washington has taken a number of actions that are positive for Saudi Arabia. An agreement to stop US bombing of the Houthis in Yemen is in line with a Saudi ceasefire there. Washington has also delinked civil nuclear talks from the normalization question.\nThe stalled Saudi-US defense pact, initially conceived as a formal treaty, was revived in the scaled-back form of security guarantees late in the Biden presidency to bypass congressional opposition.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Trump administration has now picked up those talks, along with the discussions about a civilian nuclear agreement, three of the sources said, while cautioning that it will take time to define terms.\nChina influence\nTrump’s Saudi trip is his first formal state visit and second foreign trip since his re-election, after attending the pope’s funeral in Rome. He will also visit Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\nChildren arrive with flowers for US President Donald Trump (C) during his welcoming by Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud (R), upon Trump’s arrival at King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh on May 20, 2017. ( AFP PHOTO / MANDEL NGAN)\nBeneath the showmanship of Trump’s visits, diplomats say, lies also a calculated US effort to reassert influence and reshape economic alignments in a region where Beijing — Washington’s chief economic rival — has steadily expanded its foothold at the heart of the petrodollar system.\nTrump’s first trip abroad in his first term also began in Riyadh, where he unveiled $350 billion in Saudi investments.\nTrump commands deep trust from the Saudi leadership, rooted in the close ties during his first term — a period defined by large arms deals and steadfast US backing for bin Salman, even as global outrage erupted over the killing of columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul.\nSaudi Arabia and its Gulf allies now plan to urge Trump to ease US regulations that have increasingly deterred foreign investment, particularly in sectors deemed part of America’s “critical national infrastructure,” five industry sources said.\nIn meetings with US officials, Saudi ministers will advocate for a more business-friendly climate, especially at a time when China is aggressively courting Gulf capital, the industry sources said.\nWhile countering China’s economic rise may top Trump’s foreign policy agenda, it won’t be easy in Saudi Arabia. Since the launch of Vision 2030, China has become integral to the kingdom’s plans, dominating sectors from energy and infrastructure to renewables."}

The Israeli government was also widely panned for being sidelined in the talks to secure Alexander’s release.\nThe US and Hamas both confirmed late Sunday that the terror group would release Alexander in what was described as a goodwill gesture to US President Donald Trump ahead of his visit to the region this week.\nIsrael, which sources said was not involved in talks for the release, claimed Monday the development was the result of its military pressure on Hamas, while opposition lawmakers and families of hostages panned the government for not having been a party to talks, for not pursuing a broad deal to bring all of the remaining hostages home, and for allowing negotiations to take place that apparently favored hostages with dual citizenship.\nAlexander, a dual citizen who grew up in New Jersey, was serving in the Israel Defense Forces at the time of his abduction. He was kidnapped from his base during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led onslaught that started the war in Gaza.

Ohel’s mother Idit has been particularly vocal against what she terms a form of selection between hostages during previous rounds of releases.\nAccording to the family, relying on information from freed hostages, Ohel has been kept bound in chains and received no medical attention for shrapnel in his eye and shoulder from wounds suffered on October 7, 2023.\n“With a broken heart,” the family’s statement offered good wishes to the Alexander family on their son’s impending freedom and urged Israel’s government to reach a deal securing the release of the rest of the hostages.\n“Alon and the rest of the injured hostages are being left behind in the tunnels with no medical attention or help,” the family said. “There is no date for the end of our nightmare.”\nEinav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, attends a conference at Tel Aviv University, May 7, 2025.

If Matan is left alone in the tunnel, Netanyahu is deciding to murder my boy; instead of releasing all of the hostages, he has become my private angel of death.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nZangauker, whose combative criticism of the government has made her a prominent activist on behalf of the hostages, vowed to “hunt down the prime minister” for the suffering caused to her son.\nThe family of Itay Chen, a dual US-Israeli citizen whose body is held in Gaza, said in a statement, “These are moments of mixed feelings. We rejoice in the joy of Yael and Adi Alexander, who will soon get to hug their son. Every hostage that comes home warms the hearts of the families of hostages. On the other hand, our hearts cannot bear the deep grief. It is possible, and necessary, to bring everyone back.”\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the main group representing hostage families, said in a statement Sunday that the release of Alexander “must be the start of a single agreement that will return all 59 [remaining] hostages.”\n“There is only one moral, proper, and necessary agreement: the immediate return of all the hostages and the end of the war,” said the forum, which has long been calling for the government to agree to a deal that will return all the remaining hostages at once, rather than in phases.\n“Now is the time to bring about a breakthrough in negotiations. The responsibility lies with the Israeli government,” it added. “Nobody can be left behind.”\nOn Monday, the forum announced a rally to be held at noon in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv in anticipation of Alexander’s release.\nVarda Ben Baruch holds a picture of her grandson Edan Alexander, who is held hostage in Gaza, as she gathers with other families to call out on loudspeakers in hopes that their loved ones will hear them, near the Gaza border in Kibbutz Nir Oz, southern Israel, April 20, 2025.

They have no time.”\nHe further said that reports of direct contact between the US and Hamas to reach the agreement “are a disgraceful failure of diplomacy by the Israeli government and the person who heads it. The hostages are ours, and the responsibility to return them is of the government.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nOpposition MK Benny Gantz, leader of the National Unity Party, posted that “the heart swells at the apparent return of Edan — the stomach turns to see how the Israeli government is absent from every initiative to take responsibility.”\n“The time has come for the prime minister to exercise that responsibility,” he wrote.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel has committed to facilitating a safe corridor for the return of Alexander.\nIn a statement, the Prime Minister’s Office said Jerusalem has, however, made no further promise for a ceasefire or for the release of Palestinian security prisoners, who have been exchanged for hostages in previous deals.\n“The expected release of IDF soldier Edan Alexander [by Hamas] without getting anything in return, will be possible thanks to the determined policy we led, with the backing of [US] President [Donald] Trump, and thanks to IDF troops’ military pressure in the Gaza Strip,” the PMO said.\n“We are in critical days in which Hamas is facing a deal that would enable our hostages’ release,” it added. “Negotiations will continue under fire and amidst preparations for the intensification of the fighting.”\nThen-Republican US presidential nominee Donald Trump poses for photos with the family of Edan Alexander at Ohel Chabad Lubavitch on October 7, 2024, in New York City.

We will continue to do everything to return all of our hostages.”\nThe official said Israel will facilitate a safe corridor to get Alexander out of Gaza — presumably meaning halting fighting and reconnaissance flights in certain areas — but stressed that there is no ceasefire and that Hamas isn’t getting anything in return for the release. If Hamas agrees to an Israel-accepted proposal for a wider hostage deal, the expansion of the war will be postponed, the official added.\n(From R-L) US hostage envoy Adam Boehler, Yael Alexander, Shira Boehler and Boehler’s chief of staff Raechel Greenberg on a plane from the US to Israel on May 11, 2025.

They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF. The Hamas attack also killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians.\nHamas released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals — and the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives during a ceasefire between January and March. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. In exchange, Israel has freed some 2,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners, and Gazan terror suspects detained during the war.\nEight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014.\nThe body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt. Hadar Goldin, is still being held by Hamas, and is counted among the 59 hostages."}

It’s chosen the hostages.”\nAt a separate rally in Habima Square in Tel Aviv, known for drawing more government-critical crowds, Rafi Ben Shitrit, the father of Staff Sgt. Shimon Alroy Ben Shitrit, who was killed during the attack on an IDF base on October 7, lashed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for saying this week that he “sleep[s] with a clear conscience.”\n“This week, I heard the most failed of Israel’s leaders say that he sleeps with a clear conscience. A leader under whose tenure the greatest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust occurred. He sleeps with a clear conscience. We are nearly 2,000 families whose tears have run out — and we can’t get a wink of sleep,” said Shitrit.\nRafi Ben Shitrit, whose son was killed on October 7, speaks at the Bereaved Families Memorial Ceremony marking one year since the killings, Oct. 7, 2024 (Bereaved Families Memorial Ceremony)\n“The man who financed Hamas, and whose office staff are paid by the same state that funneled billions to Hamas — sleeps with a clear conscience,” he said, referring to allegations under investigation that aides to the premier were paid by Qatar to lobby for the Hamas-supporting nation. “What more is there to say that hasn’t already been said? Indeed, we are left mute, without a voice.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nAt the same protest, Shai Mozes, whose parents Margalit and Gadi Mozes were kidnapped in the Hamas onslaught and later released in separate hostage deals, was more belligerent, saying that Israel’s “real enemy is not Hamas, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is destroying Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.”\nThe Habima rally was smaller than usual, drawing a few hundred people. The crowd was dotted with Israeli flags, and chants including, “The entire nation knows that Bibi is a crook” — using the premier’s nickname.\nThe protest started with a moment of silence for five IDF soldiers killed fighting in Gaza this week.\nYael Adar, the mother of slain captive Tamir Adar, addresses protesters on Begin Road, in Tel Aviv, on May 10, 2025. (Vardit Alon-Korpel/Pro-Democracy Protest Movement)\nAt another anti-government protest on Tel Aviv’s Begin Road, Yael Adar, whose son Tamir was snatched to Gaza after he was killed defending Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas onslaught, said the government was “sending our children to die in the name of lust for power.”\nShe slammed Netanyahu for failing to bring back the remains of her son, who was part of Nir Oz’s civilian defense squad, which fought for hours before the IDF arrived.\n“How is it that the person who went out first became transparent?” she asked. “How is it that someone who fought for the country is not being fought for by the country?”\nAdar urged Netanyahu to follow in the footsteps of Menachem Begin, who also served in the premiership while heading up the Likud party, and to resign immediately. Begin quit in 1983 amid the IDF’s rising death toll in the First Lebanon War, which he had launched the previous year.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“It’s called taking responsibility,” said Adar.\nAfter her speech and as the 1,500-odd crowd melted away, some 100 activists, many of them bearing torches, lit a bonfire on the road in front of the entrance to the IDF headquarters. They chanted: “Enough of the killing and grief, the hostages are above everything.”\nAt a protest in Kibbutz Nir Oz by the Gaza border, Silvia Cunio, mother of hostages David and Ariel Cunio, said: “There’s enough time to fight Hamas. There will be more operations and more conflicts. But Ariel and David’s lives — we won’t be able to get back if we wait too long. I don’t have the privilege to wait. And they can’t wait anymore.”\nAddressing the government, she asked: “Where are you? Where is the state? Where is the humanity? How do you sleep at night when my children and the other hostages, are buried alive underground?”\nAt the Habima protest, Media personality Linoy Bar Geffen, who often emcees the rallies, said the demonstration called for an end to the fighting in Gaza, the return of the remaining 59 hostages in a single deal, a state commission of inquiry into the disaster of October 7, an end to the governmemt’s judicial overhaul, and new elections.\n“What are you afraid of?” she asked members of Netanyahu’s coalition.\nDemonstrators protest against the government and for the release of people held hostage in the Gaza Strip outside IDF Headquarters in Tel Aviv, May 10, 2025 (Tomer Neuberg/Flash90)\n‘A country that’s worthy of living for’\nShirel Hogeg, a Sderot resident who survived the Hamas onslaught and rose to prominence after her anti-Netanyahu diatribe went viral, said the demonstration’s purpose was to make Israel “a country that’s worthy of living for, not just dying for.”\nAlso addressing the crowd, Gal Elkalay, a social activist who has served hundreds of days in the reserves since the start of the war, slammed the government’s decision to call up tens of thousands of reservists for yet another Gaza offensive, in a war she said had become futile.\n“Not the hostages, not dismantling Hamas — this war is a war to protect the coalition,” she said. “There is no more Israel Defense Force, only a Coalition Defense Force.”\n“This is not leadership, this is a criminal organization that glorifies death,” she said. “Why are we going back to war?”\nResponding to calls from the audience for soldiers to refuse to serve, she said, “We will not refuse,” but she urged members of the audience to take sick days from work and effectively shut down the economy until the government gets the message.\nDemonstrators protest against the government and for the release of people held hostage in the Gaza Strip outside IDF Headquarters in Tel Aviv, May 10, 2025 (Tomer Neuberg/Flash90)\nMeanwhile, as they have done every Saturday for several weeks, about 200 left-wing activists stood in silence on Tel Aviv’s Kaplan Street, outside IDF Headquarters’ southern entrance, holding candles and pictures of children killed by the IDF in Gaza since Israel renewed hostilities there on March 18.\nEach picture states the child’s name, as well as the date and place of their death.\nActivists hold up candles and pictures of slain Gazan children, outside the Kaplan Street entrance to the IDF headquarters, Tel Aviv, May 10, 2025.

He also said that humanitarian aid wasn’t dependent on the existence of a ceasefire.\nHe stated that the key elements of the plan were to get food distributed efficiently and safely, and prevent the Hamas terror group from getting its hands on it and stealing it. He panned Hamas as “100% responsible for the horrific situation” in the enclave, accusing the group’s leaders of “starving their people” and preventing a solution. He urged unanimous international condemnation of its “torturing of hostages in tunnels.”\nHuckabee declined to give a timeline for when the aid will begin being distributed, beyond insisting that it will hopefully be very soon.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe US envoy acknowledged that the initiative “won’t be perfect — especially in its early days.”\n“It is a logistical challenge to make this work,” he said.\nUS President Donald Trump, left, shakes hands with Assistant to the President, Senior Adviser and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff after Witkoff’s swearing-in ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on May 6, 2025.

Organizers instead sufficed with the press conference held on Friday by Huckabee.\nIn the meantime, the Trump administration is pressuring international humanitarian organizations to cooperate with the new plan, three sources familiar with the matter told The Times of Israel last week.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAmid this pushback from various groups, the Trump administration has indicated to these organizations — including the World Food Programme — that their US funding could be slashed if they do not cooperate, a staffer at an international aid group, a senior Western diplomat and an Israeli official told The Times of Israel.\nLazar Berman contributed to this report."}

(AP/Mark Schiefelbein)\n“He told me he wants a Trump Tower in Damascus. He wants peace with his neighbors. What he told me is good for the region, good for Israel,” said Bass.\nSharaa also shared what he saw as a personal connection with Trump: both have been shot at, narrowly surviving attempts on their lives, Bass said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSyrian officials and a presidency media official did not respond to a request for comment.\nSharaa spoke with Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Sunday, according to the Syrian presidency.\nA person close to Sharaa said afterwards a Trump-Sharaa meeting remained possible in Saudi Arabia, but would not confirm whether Sharaa had received an invitation.\n“Whether or not the meeting takes place won’t be known until the last moment,” the person said.\n‘Push underway’\nTo be clear, a Trump-Sharaa meeting during the US president’s visit to the region is widely seen as unlikely, given Trump’s packed schedule, his priorities and lack of consensus within Trump’s team on how to tackle Syria.\nA source familiar with ongoing efforts said a high-level Syria-US meeting was set to take place in the region during the week of Trump’s visit, but that it would not be between Trump and Sharaa.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“There is definitely a push underway,” said Charles Lister, head of the Syria Initiative at the Middle East Institute.\n“The idea is that getting to Trump directly is the best avenue because there are just too many ideologues within the administration to get past.”\nWashington is yet to formulate and articulate a coherent Syria policy, but the administration has increasingly been viewing relations with Damascus from a perspective of counterterrorism, three sources including a US official familiar with the policy-making said.\nThat approach was illustrated by the make-up of the US delegation in a meeting last month between Washington and Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani in New York, which included a senior counterterrorism official from the State Department, two of the sources said.\nAccompanied by unidentified members of the delegation, US congressman Cory Mills (Republican of Florida), second from right, walks in the Old City of Damascus, April 18, 2025.

Still, Trump defended the idea — which would amount to a US president accepting an astonishingly valuable gift from a foreign government — as a fiscally smart move for the country.\n“So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,” Trump posted on his social media site on Sunday night. “Anybody can do that!”\nABC News reported that Trump will use the aircraft as his presidential plane until shortly before he leaves office in January 2029, when ownership will be transferred to the foundation overseeing his yet-to-be-built presidential library.\nThe gift was expected to be announced when Trump visits Qatar, according to ABC’s report, as part of a trip that also includes stops in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — but not Israel — the first extended foreign travel of his second term.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nBefore Trump’s post trumpeting the idea, Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar’s media attaché, said in a statement that the “possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is currently under consideration between Qatar’s Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense.”\n“But the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made,” the statement added.\nMeanwhile, US administration officials, anticipating ethics concerns, have prepared an analysis arguing that accepting the plane would be legal, according to ABC. The Constitution’s Emoluments Clause bars anyone holding government office from accepting any present, emolument, office or title from any “King, Prince, or foreign State,” without congressional consent.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA 13-year-old private Boeing aircraft that US President Donald Trump toured to check out new hardware and technology features, and highlight the aircraft maker’s delay in delivering updated versions of the Air Force One presidential aircraft, takes off from Palm Beach International Airport, February 16, 2025, in West Palm Beach, Florida. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis, File)\nOne expert on government ethics, Kathleen Clark of the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, accused Trump of being “committed to exploiting the federal government’s power, not on behalf of policy goals, but for amassing personal wealth.”\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer poked fun at Trump’s “America first” political slogan.\n“Nothing says ‘America First’ like Air Force One, brought to you by Qatar,” the New York Democrat said in a statement. “It’s not just bribery, it’s premium foreign influence with extra legroom.”\nEven some conservatives expressed dismay online, noting that an aircraft being offered by a foreign government could present security risks if used by a US president.\nAir Force One is a modified Boeing 747. Two exist, and the president flies on both, which are more than 30 years old. Boeing Inc. has the contract to produce updated versions, but delivery has been delayed while the company has lost billions of dollars on the project.\nTrump intends to convert the Qatari aircraft into a plane he can fly on as president, with the US Air Force planning to add secure communications and other classified elements to it. But it will still have more limited capabilities than the existing planes that were built to serve as Air Force One, as well as two other aircraft currently under construction, according to a former US official.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe official was briefed about the plane and spoke Sunday on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans that have not yet been made public.\nThe existing planes used as Air Force One are heavily modified with survivability capabilities for the president for a range of contingencies, including radiation shielding and antimissile technology. They also include a variety of communications systems to allow the president to remain in contact with the military and issue orders from anywhere in the world.\nUS President Donald Trump raises a fist as he steps off Air Force One upon arrival at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on April 27, 2025. (Mandel Ngan/AFP)\nThe official told The Associated Press that it would be possible to quickly add some countermeasures and communications systems to the Qatari plane, but that it would be less capable than the existing Air Force One aircraft or long-delayed replacements.\nNeither the Qatari plane nor the upcoming VC-25B aircraft will have the air-to-air refueling capabilities of the current VC-25A aircraft, which is the one the president currently flies on, the official said.\nJordan Libowitz, communications director for the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, called such a gift “unprecedented.”\n“The totality of gifts given to a president over their term doesn’t get close to this level,” Libowitz said, adding, “You have to ask, if he makes foreign policy — especially in regards to the Middle East — how much is he being influenced by his gifts and his business deals.”\nABC said the new plane is similar to a 13-year-old Boeing aircraft Trump toured in February, while it was parked at Palm Beach International Airport and he was spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club.\nTrump faced lawsuits for violating the Emoluments Clause during his first term, but those were ended by the US Supreme Court in 2021, which found the cases moot because the Republican had left office.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTrump’s family business, the Trump Organization, which is now largely run by his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, has vast and growing interests in the Middle East. That includes a new deal to build a luxury golf resort in Qatar, partnering with Qatari Diar, a real estate company backed by that country’s sovereign wealth fund.\nQatar, which is ruled by the Al Thani family, is home to the state-owned airline Qatar Airways. The country has also worked to have a close relationship with Trump after he apparently backed a boycott of Doha by four Arab nations in his first term. Trump later in his term applauded Qatar.\nAdministration officials have brushed off concerns about the president’s policy interests blurring with the family’s business profits. They note that Trump’s assets are in a trust managed by his children and that a voluntary ethics agreement released by the Trump Organization in January bars the company from striking deals directly with foreign governments.\nBut that same agreement allows deals with private companies abroad. That is a departure from Trump’s first term, when the organization released an ethics pact prohibiting both foreign government and foreign company deals.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked Friday if the president might meet with people who have ties to his family’s business, said it was “ridiculous” to suggest Trump “is doing anything for his own benefit.”"}

Palestinians — including the families of prisoners and slain attackers — will be able to apply for welfare stipends, and bureaucrats will adjudicate whether each applicant will receive payments and how much based on economic criteria, Palestinian and US officials have told The Times of Israel.\nThe transition to the new system has taken time, but last month, senior Palestinian official Hussein al-Sheikh — who has since been formally appointed Abbas’s deputy — penned a letter to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio inviting the Trump administration to send a delegation to Ramallah from June 1 onward in order to certify that the PA has implemented the reform and is in compliance with US legislation that bars American aid that directly benefits the PA so long as its previous prisoner payment system remained in place.\nPalestinian sources told The Times of Israel in March and April that families of prisoners and slain attackers were still receiving stipends based on the old system, as the new system was not in place.

The war started on October 7, 2023, when the Palestinian terror group Hamas led an invasion of southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 251 abducted as hostages to Gaza.\nThere have been repeated calls from groups of reservists to not turn up for duty over the past two years, mostly as a protest against the government’s planned judicial overhaul, seen as undermining democracy, and against the renewed fighting in Gaza, which critics say is a political move that will endanger the lives of the remaining hostages.\nThere is also mounting discontent at the number of days reservists have being asked to serve since the start of the Gaza war, with some called up for hundreds of days.

Former Mossad members, ex-IDF paratroopers, and graduates of an elite military program have also given their support.\nThe army recently issued tens of thousands of call-up orders for IDF reservists ahead of a planned major offensive in the Gaza Strip.\nAmid mass protests in 2023 against the government’s controversial judicial overhaul agenda, several groups of reservists, including some in the IAF, issued statements saying they would refuse to serve under a regime they no longer viewed as democratic.\nAt the height of the 2023 protests, hundreds of IDF reservists signed declarations saying they would no longer show up for reserve duty to protest the government advancing its plans to curtail the judiciary.\nHowever, when war erupted in Gaza on October 7, 2023, with the Hamas-led attacks and massacres, nearly 300,000 reservists showed up for duty, marking the largest-ever call-up of reservists in Israel’s history."}

If organizers had waited until they had secured all the necessary funding, nothing would likely be done by now, he said.\n“Oskar and Emilie Schindler are proof that one person can make a difference,” the museum quotes Rena Finder, one of the Schindler’s Jews, as saying. “Everybody said there was nothing I could do.

But she returned to her homeland in 1973, just before the colony got its independence, and her four children grew up in Paramaribo.\nMore than anyone, she knows how precious the archive was.\n“I told the congregation, as long as the archive is still here, I will not die. Even if I live to be 200 years old,” she tearfully told AP. “This is keeping the history of my people.”"}

The Houthi missile impacted in a grove of trees alongside an access road close to Terminal 3, several hundred yards from the airport control tower.\n“We are facing a situation where a missile that fell in Ben Gurion Airport could have just as easily fallen a little bit to the left or the right and could have hit an aircraft or a terminal, and that could have had a catastrophic effect,” Adv. Shirly Kazir, head of aviation & tourism practices at law firm FISCHER (FBC) told The Times of Israel. “So foreign airlines are obviously fearful, but even if airlines are willing to consider resuming flights to Israel when the situation calms down a bit, safety and the issue of pricing of insurance premiums come up once again.”\nKazir, who represents 20 foreign airlines operating in Europe and the US, said that the carriers want to resume flight services to Tel Aviv, but for that to happen, they will need more certainty and flexibility on the regulatory situation in Israel to ease costs and financial risk if they have to halt operations again because of the security situation.\nSign up for the Tech Israel Daily\nand never miss Israel's top tech stories\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“If it’s important for Israel to have the asset of foreign airlines flying to Israel, there are solutions the Transportation Ministry can advance that wouldn’t be too costly and that could make a shift in the airlines’ decision,” said Kazir, who has been representing foreign airlines in a proposal to make amendments to the 2012 Aviation Services Law, which protects consumer rights of passengers whose flights have been canceled.\nSmoke in the area of Ben Gurion Airport after a ballistic missile was fired at Israel from Yemen on May 4, 2025 (Screen grab from social media used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)\nAfter the rocket impact near the airport — which followed failed Israeli and American attempts to shoot it down — the Houthis boasted of their success and claimed that Ben Gurion Airport was “no longer safe for air travel.” The Yemen-based terror group threatened to “blockade” Israel’s airspace.\n“The fact that a missile managed to infiltrate and hit around Ben Gurion Airport caused a lot of concern,” said Eyal Doron, partner and head of the aviation department at law firm S. Horowitz & Co. “Had it fallen someplace else, far away from the airport for example, in an open area in the Negev desert, I’m not sure it would have caused such substantive material reaction by foreign airlines.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nInitially, many foreign carriers suspended flights to Israel for short periods of a day or two, while monitoring the situation daily. But by the end of last week, the list of airlines deciding to stay away for longer expanded. Some foreign airlines are postponing their return for weeks or months and, in some cases, indefinitely.\nIn response, the Transportation Ministry said that the government and aviation authorities are continuously working with foreign airlines to bring them back and restore flight services.\nAs of now, the Lufthansa Group — which includes German carrier Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, and Eurowings — has said it will not resume flights to Tel Aviv until May 19. Air India, which operates a direct route between Israel and India, has suspended flights until May 25. US carriers United and Delta airlines have halted flights until May 18 and May 20 respectively. Iberia will not resume flights until June 1, and British Airways not until June 15.\nAmong low-cost airlines, Wizz Air canceled flights until May 14, and Ryanair until May 21. UK carrier Virgin Atlantic at the end of April ceased direct flight services between London and Tel Aviv, after previously pausing the route amid the war.\nAccording to Kazir and Doron, recent flight suspensions by foreign airlines are based on similar considerations that have guided them throughout the war: safety considerations, risk management, insurance policy coverage and the refusal of flight crews to fly to Israel. They both cautioned that many foreign airlines halting their flight services will divert aircraft destined for Tel Aviv to other places, making it harder to resume service.\nAdv. Shirly Kazir, head of aviation & tourism practices at the FISCHER (FBC) law firm. (Courtesy of Ofir Abe)\n“If foreign airlines take their aircraft to a new route and a different destination, the chances of us getting them back for the summer period now are very low,” said Kazir. “Many clients I have, meaning foreign airlines, advise me in confidence that they are not resuming flights to Israel until the summer, which is horrific.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nMany of the airlines had only recently resumed services to Israel after they were canceled for much of the time since Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023, that started the war in Gaza. United had resumed flights in March, while Delta returned on April 1, and British Airways restarted its Israel flights on April 5.\n“Foreign airlines would like to fly to Israel, especially from a business point of view, as they’ve sold tickets [and] they don’t want August 2024 to happen again, faced with a situation where they have to deal with refunds and might again be sued by passengers,” said Doron.\n“Under the current situation, when nothing is clear, as we do not know what’s going to happen even next week, the State of Israel needs to convince foreign airlines that its airspace is safe, the airport is safe, and what happened a week ago was a very exceptional issue… No system is perfect, no system can give you 100% protection,” she said.\nWith foreign carriers absent, the supply of flights low and demand high, ticket prices will surge again, Doron and Kazir warned. Of the dozens of foreign airlines that dominated the local aviation market before the outbreak of war in Gaza, primarily Israeli carriers have maintained regular flight schedules amid the war. In recent days, Emirates, Abu Dhabi’s Etihad, and flydubai also continued flying despite the Houthi attack.\n“As foreign airlines cancel a flight, they already lose money because they can’t reallocate the airplane immediately, and then they have to refund passengers for the cost of the tickets or try to reroute them at a much higher cost — a monetary exposure they have faced throughout the war,” said Doron.\n“Many foreign airlines only resumed their Israel services in March, to end up in a situation where a couple of weeks later, flights are being canceled again, and they are again hit with ticket refunds and compensation. It’s not sustainable for a long time.”\nShe warned that “if the disruptions go on for a long time, my concern is that some airlines could decide that they are not coming back.”\nEarlier this year, Israeli lawmakers agreed to make legal changes to canceled flight compensation rights for air passengers to help ease the financial costs of disruptions to foreign carriers during the war period. The Knesset Economics Committee approved a proposal by foreign airlines to make amendments to the 2012 Aviation Services Law, which will restrict the terms and conditions of compensation paid by airlines to passengers in the event of flight cancellations during an emergency war period. The legal amendment was passed in a second and third reading in the Knesset in February.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDepending on the security situation, the Transportation Ministry, in consultation with the Economy Ministry, will be given the power and authority to temporarily suspend some of the compensation entitlements of consumers, such as limiting the obligation to provide accommodation in the event of a flight cancellation for up to two nights.\nAdv. Eyal Doron, partner and head of the aviation department at law firm S. Horowitz & Co. (Courtesy)\n“If foreign airlines [knew] that they have that flexibility from the Israeli regulation, it would give them more comfort to resume flight services, but for that to kick in, Israel needs to declare a special emergency situation,” said Kazir.\n“Foreign airlines want to know that they don’t sell flight tickets for ‘X’ amount, and then, in the case of cancellations, have to pay 10 times ‘X’.”\nDuring an emergency period, an airline that cancels all of its flights will also have options to offer passengers an alternative ticket, either from a different point of departure or to a different nearby destination such as Larnaca or Athens.\n“Airlines want to know that if they are not flying to Israel because of the security situation, they can bring passengers to nearby Cyprus or Greece instead of being exposed to massive costs that they would have to pay — to mostly Israeli airlines — to get passengers to their final destination in Tel Aviv,” said Kazir."}

As we promised, we will respond, strongly in Yemen and anywhere else necessary,” he said in a statement.\nThe Friday attack came three days after the US announced that it had reached a ceasefire with the Yemeni terror group.\nHouthi officials made clear that the deal, in which they agreed to stop targeting US maritime activity in the Red Sea in exchange for an end to weeks of intense US airstrikes, did not include any agreement to stop firing at Israel or ships linked to the Jewish state.\nOn Wednesday, the IDF said a missile fired by the Houthis crashed outside Israeli territory. Earlier in the day, the IDF said it had downed a drone launched from Yemen.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe attacks came after Israel carried out two days of heavy sorties targeting infrastructure controlled by the Houthis in response to the missile that struck Ben Gurion Airport. Since Ben Gurion was hit, most foreign airlines have suspended flights to Israel.\nThe fiery reprisals destroyed the international airport in the capital Sanaa, and caused heavy damage to a port in Hodeida and several power stations and a cement factory, officials said.\nThe Houthis — whose slogan calls for “Death to America, Death to Israel, [and] a Curse on the Jews” — first began attacking Israel and maritime traffic in November 2023, a month after the October 7 Hamas massacre.\nThe Houthis held their fire when a ceasefire was reached between Israel and Hamas in January 2025. By that point, they had fired over 40 ballistic missiles and dozens of attack drones and cruise missiles at Israel, including one that killed a civilian and wounded several others in Tel Aviv in July, prompting Israel’s first strike in Yemen.\nSince March 18, when the IDF resumed its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis have launched some 29 ballistic missiles and at least 10 drones at Israel.\nThe sirens warning of missile attacks have sent hundreds of thousands of Israelis rushing to shelters at all hours of the day and night."}

Those strikes were in retaliation for an April terror attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 24 tourists.\nIndia’s use of Israeli drone platforms in this operation reflects an alliance that has matured over the decades.\nDr. Oshrit Birvadker, a senior fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security (JISS) and an expert in India-Middle East relations, told The Times of Israel that the deployment of Harop and Heron Mark-2 drones in this strike illustrates how “Israel plays a significant and growing role in India’s current military strategy, particularly in light of escalations with Pakistan and the broader counterterrorism context.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nShe noted that “India is the biggest international buyer of defense systems from Israel Aerospace Industries” and that the advanced drones have “significantly expanded [India’s] high-altitude surveillance and strike capability.”\nA side view of the Israel Aerospace Industries Harop drone at the Paris Air Show in 2013. (Wikipedia/Julian Herzog/CC BY 4.0)\nTactical capability, strategic messaging\nAccording to IAI’s website, its loitering munitions are designed to provide flexible, rapid-response capabilities across a range of operational scenarios — from short-range missions to deep-strike engagements — while delivering real-time intelligence-gathering and precision strike potential.\nThese features make them particularly effective in unpredictable and complex combat environments, including densely populated urban areas like Karachi and Lahore.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBirvadker explained that while Israeli arms exports to India, including advanced systems like suicide drones, are “transactional in nature,” they also carry “implicit political and strategic weight.”\n“From Israel’s perspective, India is not only a key market but also a strategic partner that shares common concerns over terrorism, border security, and Islamic extremism. Both countries often frame their cooperation as part of a broader struggle against radical threats,” she added.\nWhile Israel avoids making explicit political endorsements in South Asian conflicts, its consistent arms supply has been widely interpreted as quiet support for India’s regional posture, especially against common adversaries such as Pakistan and, increasingly, China.\nVendors sort for distribution in Guwahati, India, newspapers leading with reports of India firing missiles early Wednesday into Pakistani-controlled territory, May 8, 2025.

(Murtaz Ali / AFP)\nBeyond political optics, international attention is turning to the issue of arms sales to conflict zones.\n“There is a strong likelihood that international scrutiny will intensify regarding the sale of advanced military technology to countries engaged in ongoing regional conflicts,” Birvadker said.\nWith rising global focus on human rights and de-escalation, she noted, governments and defense firms may face pressure to justify arms exports, particularly precision weapons and surveillance tools used in volatile areas.\nAn enduring alliance\nStill, Birvadker sees the India-Israel partnership as resilient: “Strong alliances endure even in difficult times and under pressure, and I believe the India-Israel relationship is a prime example of that.”\nShe pointed out that during Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on the country, “while several European countries and traditional allies of Israel delayed arms shipments, India stood firmly by its side, even at the cost of diplomatic risk and international criticism.”\nOshrit Birvadker speaks on Channel 12, January 2022 (Screen capture)\nWith India being the world’s largest arms importer and Israel its fourth-largest supplier, the stakes of this relationship are high. The Indian defense market represents not just economic opportunity but geopolitical alignment for Israel.\n“Given the critical role Israeli defense industries play in India,” Birvadker said, “any concerns over this relationship are unlikely to disrupt it; on the contrary, such concerns may actually deepen and expand defense trade between New Delhi and Jerusalem.”"}

The IDF, she believed, was the strongest army in the world, and the private and public bomb shelters found in most apartment buildings and around cities would offer protection if the need arose.\n“All that changed on October 7,” she told The Times of Israel during a recent interview. “Something broke in my heart. I no longer felt safe in my own country. Already before that, my husband and I were really scared about Israel’s future, especially its democracy, due to the legal revolution the [Netanyahu] government tried to do.”\nAs the magnitude of the disaster became known — thousands of Hamas-led terrorists slaughtered some 1,200 people in southern Israel and abducted 251 to the Gaza Strip in an unprecedented invasion that left the Gaza envelope in ruins — Foux and her family left their home in Kfar Saba and flew to Athens, Greece, where they lived until moving to Toronto.\nWhen they arrived last spring, they were among the estimated 5,000 Israelis who moved to Toronto in the wake of the October 7, 2023, onslaught. It was Foux’s first time in Canada.\nThe family decided on the country after hearing it had introduced a special initiative for Israelis — the Special Measures Open Work Permit initiative — which provided a legal pathway to living in Canada. Foux and her husband chose Toronto because it was already home to about 60,000 Israelis, an increasingly large segment of the area’s 200,000-strong Jewish community.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nIn 2024, according to Canadian government figures, nearly 11,000 Israelis received either work permits under a special program or regular temporary residence status. The number of Israelis applying for temporary residence (often a step toward permanent residence or official immigration) more than tripled in 2024 compared to the previous year, from 3,153 to 9,753. Toronto was the most popular destination, by far.\nMost Israeli newcomers do not seem overly concerned by the drastic rise in antisemitism in Canada since October 7. Newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney, has — much to the consternation of many Canadian Jews — said little about the problem.\nIt is an issue for Jews in Toronto, where the police just released sobering new statistics, showing that reported hate crimes increased 19 percent in 2024 compared to 2023, of which Jews were the leading target (40%), despite representing less than 4% of the city’s population. Likewise, a lengthy recent Israeli Diaspora Ministry report stated, “In 2024, Canada earned the dubious distinction as ‘champion of antisemitism.’”\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, for many Israeli transplants, the embrace of the Toronto Jewish community has more than made up for any yet-to-be experienced hate crimes.\n“Toronto’s Jewish community has been amazing, like one big welcoming family,” says Foux, who worked as a schoolteacher and tour guide in Israel. “They made our landing much smoother.”\nRotem Foux. (Courtesy)\nIsraeli newcomers are a top priority for the Prosserman JCC and Schwartz/Reisman Centre.\n“Since October 7, we’ve welcomed a significant influx of Israeli families seeking stability and connection in Toronto,” says Prosserman JCC and Schwartz/Reisman Centre CEO Andrew Levy. “We’ve responded by creating programs, services, and a warm, supportive community where they can rebuild and find a sense of belonging.”\nLike other immigrants to Canada, Israeli newcomers face many challenges, including housing, employment, schools for children, administrative and bureaucratic requirements, language and cultural differences, and the fabled Canadian winter.\nThey receive help from various Jewish agencies, whose funding comes largely from the UJA Federation of Greater Toronto, the city’s main Jewish community organization.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPresident and CEO of the UJA Federation of Greater Toronto Adam Minsky. (Courtesy)\n“After October 7, we quickly identified two segments of Israelis who were especially vulnerable in Greater Toronto,” says Adam Minsky, UJA President and CEO. “The first were those visiting Toronto [during the High Holidays] when the war began, and couldn’t return to Israel due to travel restrictions and limited flights, or they lived in the affected war zone, or other reasons. The second were Israelis who came to Canada after the war began, seeking short-term or longer-term respite from the trauma and crisis that were unfolding there.”\nHot before it was cool\nWell before October 7, some Israelis already had their eyes on Canada.\n“For a long time, moving here was on my mind,” says Elad Shtamer, 40, a dance and music teacher and computer programming tutor. “After the birth of my daughter in 2020, the idea became more present in my life. Then, when the Canadian government made it easier for Israelis to get work permits after October 7, it became more real.”\nAt the time, he, his wife, and their daughter were living in Tzlafon, an agriculture cooperative 35 kilometers (roughly 22 miles) east of Ashdod. Subsequent events ultimately led them to move to Toronto last June, where they welcomed their second child a few months later.\n“What influenced us was the ongoing war over our heads,” adds Shtamer. “We lived in a village where we could hear the bombings of both Hamas and the IDF and we needed some peace and quiet, especially for our daughter.”\nElad Shtamer. (Courtesy)\nMany Israelis moving to Toronto contact JIAS (Jewish Immigrant Aid Services), some even before arriving. It provides useful information and orientation sessions, assistance navigating Canadian bureaucracy, connections with Jewish community bodies, housing and social and professional opportunities, mental health/well-being programs, and language support.\nAs manager of community engagement at JIAS, Jodi Block works with Israeli newcomers. She helps with housing needs and oversees the 150 volunteers from the community who have assisted Israelis post-October 7.\n“The work we did with Ukrainians arriving in Toronto following the Russian invasion in 2022 made us better prepared for the arrival of Israelis over the past 19 months,” says Block, who has worked at JIAS since 2004. “We formalized a kind of crisis handbook as a turn-key response plan, which provided a framework for our response starting October 7.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nShe does not pass judgment on those who leave Israel.\n“Mobility is part of 21st-century life and people choose where to live for different reasons,” adds Block.\nThere to stay\nElinor Aichenblatt and her family arrived in Toronto last May. On October 7, she, her husband and two young daughters were living in Sderot, where Hamas terrorists killed dozens of people that day.\n“It was horrible,” says Aichenblatt, 40, who was then five months pregnant. “It really felt like the Holocaust. We locked ourselves in our bomb shelter, knowing we had to be quiet, which was nearly impossible with small children. We really feared for our lives.”\nElinor Aichenblatt. (Courtesy)\nThe next day, while Hamas terrorists were still in the area, Elinor and her family fled north to the center of the country, moving several times before settling in Kfar Saba.\n“It was extremely difficult,” adds Aichenblatt. “We had to show our daughters everything was okay. I had to function while I was completely broken, physically and mentally. I couldn’t breathe anymore. The pressure and sense of insecurity overwhelmed me. There was a feeling of mourning, fear, and sadness. I knew people who were murdered, kidnapped, and died during the war.”\nAfter her husband learned of Canada’s special visa program for Israelis, he told Aichenblatt about it.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“At first, I thought he was crazy,” she says. “We had already gone through so much and now again to move, and to another continent? But deep down, I wanted it. I felt it would be the right step for me and my family.”\nBoth Aichenblatt, who worked as a nurse in Israel and has a background in IT and medical products sales, and her husband, an architect and software engineering manager, still seek employment. Nevertheless, she has no regrets about the move.\n“I needed it,” says Aichenblatt. “I’m breathing again. It’s so quiet and peaceful here, stress-free and beautiful. It’s what I need these days.”\nWhen asked if she would consider moving back to Israel if the war in Gaza ended and the border with Lebanon stayed quiet, she’s definitive.\n“No way!” Aichenblatt insists. “We lost faith and trust in the notion of peace. And after settling down in a different country with our kids, we’re not leaving at this stage. That’s probably the case for most Israelis who’ve moved here since October 7.”\nThe surge in interest in Toronto from Israelis has led to grassroots initiatives and commercial services offering assistance to newcomers and those exploring such a move.\nMichal Harel and her husband Avital Epstein show the website they set up to help Israelis navigate a move to Canada in Oakville, Ontario, Canada, December 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Rob Gillies)\nMichal Harel, who came with her husband and two children from Emek Hefer in Israel to Toronto in 2019 for a job relocation, heads the volunteer organization Ovrim to Canada, or Moving to Canada, which offers free information to Israelis about Canada.\n“Immediately after October 7, my husband and I started receiving phone calls and emails from friends and relatives in Israel who knew about our relocation to Canada,” says Harel, who also runs a relocation company. “They asked us about moving to Canada and if we could help them. We found ourselves talking on the phone for hours every day, explaining Canadian immigration rules and life here. Eventually, realizing we couldn’t keep talking on the phone all day, we built a website about moving to Canada.”\nSince its inception, the Hebrew website, which includes guidance on Canadian bureaucracy, immigration regulations, employment, health and community life and recommends immigration consultants and realtors, has had more than 100,000 visitors, of which 5,000 have either emailed or phoned Ovrim to Canada. Every day, the non-profit receives queries from Israeli families and individuals of all ages and socioeconomic levels.\nA Hebrew language Rosh Hashanah event at the Schwartz/Reisman Centre in Toronto, October 2024.

His real estate agency and his website Canada Soft Landing mainly find rental housing for Israelis and give advice on employment, where to live, schooling for children, opening a bank account, obtaining a Canadian driving license and connecting with Jewish community support agencies. As he is paid by landlords for finding new tenants, Adivi does not charge newcomers for his services.\nStav Adivi. (Courtesy)\nMost Israelis contact Adivi before arriving, finding his Hebrew-language website via Facebook, Google or word-of-mouth. Over the past year, he has averaged 10 to 15 emails or phone calls from Israelis every week, significantly more than before October 7. Adivi, a Toronto resident since 2006, following three years in the US after leaving Israel, expects the numbers to rise before the special visa program ends on July 31.\nToronto has particular appeal.\n“The majority come to the Toronto area because its large population provides a strong economy and better job market, and also due to Jewish community support and networking with other Israelis for social and professional needs,” says Adivi. “Many, if not most, Israelis like to be near other Israelis as consolation for leaving behind family and friends back home.”\nLess of a stigma\nFormer Jerusalemite Galya Sarner (full disclosure: Sarner is married to this article’s author) has long worked closely with Israelis in Toronto.\n“It’s sad to see how many Israelis have left Israel since October 7 and moved to Toronto,” says Sarner, who, as director of Israel engagement at the Prosserman JCC and Schwartz/Reisman Centre, oversees events and projects to integrate newcomers into the community. “They may now be far from Israel, but you can’t take Israel away from them. They’re incredible ambassadors for Israel, bringing the Israeli flavor and culture at its best.”\nIsraelis attend a Hebrew language Rosh Hashanah event at the Schwartz/Reisman Centre in Toronto, October 2024. (Courtesy)\nToday, expatriate Israelis face less stigma back home than in the past.\n“My family and friends were all supportive of my decision, even my parents,” says Aichenblatt. “They understood and encouraged me to take that step. They knew how hard it was for me in Israel after October 7.”\nFoux faced a much more mixed response.\n“My family was very supportive, much more so than some of my friends,” she says. “Initially, after we first moved to Greece on October 7, most of my friends were really encouraging and told me I was doing the right thing. But once we decided to stay on there [before moving to Toronto], some friends dramatically changed their attitude, saying all Israelis need to stay in Israel. I felt a lot of hostility from some of them.”\nGusti Yehoshua-Braverman, who heads the Jerusalem-based World Zionist Organization’s department focusing on Israelis overseas, participated in a recent WZO conference in Florida of representatives of Israeli communities in North America.\nFor Yehoshua-Braverman, the priority is reinforcing the connection between expatriate Israelis and their homeland and ensuring Israel always has open arms for them.\n“No one knows how long these Israelis will live outside Israel,” says Yehoshua-Braverman. “Some will stay for a lifetime. Others will return. One thing I know for sure from our experience, and I say this representing a national, Zionist institution, is that being a Zionist doesn’t necessarily mean living in Israel. What’s important is to keep the bond between Israelis living abroad and the state of Israel, and to keep them rooted in Judaism and the Hebrew language.”"}

Most participants are between 21-26 years old, with approximately half being discharged soldiers, a quarter being Supernova festival survivors or residents from border communities, and another quarter dealing with various forms of trauma and grief.\nA 2025 qualitative study from Tel Hai Academic College found that the center’s non-clinical approach helps participants address what researchers identified as common themes of “emotional dislocation, mistrust, and existential uncertainty” through community connection and creative expression.\nADVERTISEMENT\nParticipants at David’s Circle in Koh Phangan, Thailand, March 2025. (Inor Kagno)\nA sanctuary born from tragedy\nDavid’s Circle is based on Thailand’s scenic island of Koh Phangan, on which it is estimated that about 600 Israeli families reside and thousands more visit for short-term stays.\nThe vision originated with Israeli trauma specialist Yael Shoshani-Rom, who had been working with survivors of the Supernova music festival, where over 360 revelers were murdered in one of the most gruesome massacres on October 7.\n“I started hearing from my personal patients that they feel they can’t heal in Israel because the situation was unbearable — it still is unbearable.

As night falls, participants form a circle around the crackling flames, where they share stories, process emotions, and find connection through guided discussions on topics ranging from coping through struggle to inner resilience. Across the river, accessible by a small footbridge, stands the shala, a traditional Thai pavilion where workshops are held — from voice-opening exercises to ice bathing and discussions about coping with PTSD-related sleep disruptions.\n“What I fell in love with is how you can do super professional work that’s based on knowledge, research, and the most advanced techniques, but you don’t need a clinic for it — you can do it on a pouf, on a mat, during things that are very healthy and part of their world without making them feel that they are now in crisis,” Shoshani-Rom says.\nBeyond traditional therapy\n“There’s something in conventional treatment that doesn’t actually look at you as who you are,” says Ahia Meir Malul, a 28-year-old artist and Supernova festival survivor who has thrived in the informal space of David’s Circle after struggling in Israel. “You exist more than just your problem; you are a whole world in itself. When [therapists] only address the problem, they miss 99% of what’s actually happening.”\nWhat sets David’s Circle apart is not just its relaxed setting, but its embrace of a peer-support model.\nParticipants at David’s Circle in Koh Phangan, Thailand, March 2025.

The embryo implantation mistake was made at the Rishon Lezion Assuta Medical Center in 2022, where the birth mother was undergoing fertility treatments.\nThe error was discovered during the pregnancy, when the fetus was determined to have medical problems, and subsequent tests revealed that neither the woman carrying the child nor her husband could be the biological parents.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe Rishon Lezion Family Court ruled in November 2024, based on a professional opinion submitted to the court, that Sophia’s genetic parents were her “natural parents” and that it was “best for a child to be raised by them.”\nIllustrative: An in vitro fertilization embryologist works on a petri dish at a fertility clinic in London, August 14, 2013. (AP Photo/Sang Tan)\nBut the Central District Court reversed that decision in March this year, ruling that the parental rights of the birth mother and her partner should be given preference over that of the genetic parents, a decision that was appealed by the genetic parents, resulting in Sunday’s Supreme Court ruling.\nJudges Yael Wilner, Ofer Grosskopf, and Yehiel Kasher all ruled that the birth mother and her partner were Sophia’s legal parents. Judge Alex Stein also ruled to reject the appeal and that the birth mother was Sophia’s legal mother, but contended that the genetic father should be registered as the child’s father — without guardianship rights.\nADVERTISEMENT\nJudge Daphne Barak Erez maintained that Sophia’s genetic parents should be the legal parents.\nWriting for the majority, Wilner said that there was a lacuna in the law for dealing with the legal questions arising from the situation.\nShe therefore used a legal tool of deduction from a clause in the 1996 Surrogacy Law, which established that in a situation in which the surrogate mother decides to withdraw from a surrogacy agreement with the genetic parents (with the agreement of a court), the birthing mother is the legal mother and guardian of the baby.\nWilner wrote that that law can be applied to the current case since the contested parentage claims, which the surrogacy law discusses, mirror the contested parentage claims in the embryo mix-up case.\nWilner also wrote that Sophia’s birth mother and her partner had already established a parental connection to the baby before her genetic parents were able to seek custody.\nAnd she wrote that the good of the child justified leaving her in the care of her birth mother and partner due to “the fact that the young girl has lived with them from the day of her birth and sees them as her father and mother,” as well as Sophia’s “complex medical situation,” from which she has suffered since birth.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIllustrative image: A single sperm is injected directly into an egg as part of IVF.

The women likely went in for the embryo transfer in the wrong order, resulting in the error."}

(Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)\nBoaron’s statement echoed National Missions and Settlements Minister Orit Strock, who in a text chat leaked in January 2024 also claimed there were government ministers who are struggling financially.\n“No ministers get fat salaries. I know ministers who can’t make ends meet each month, even though they work very hard, night and day — and there are even those whose parents are supporting them financially,” Strock wrote at the time.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBoaron’s complaints regarding salaries appeared at odds with recent claims that his salaries bill is not actually meant to increase ministers and lawmakers’ compensation.\nLast Sunday, the Ministerial Committee for Legislation backed Boaron’s bill, which aims to regulate and equalize salaries between senior officials in all three branches of government.\nIf passed, the bill would establish a three-member public committee that would determine the salary of the president, from which all other officials’ salaries would be derived, in a manner intended “to create equality between the governmental authorities.”\nThe president, the prime minister and the president of the Supreme Court would all earn equivalent salaries, while the opposition leader would receive 94 percent of their salary and government ministers and MKs would bring in 88% and 76%, respectively.\nCurrently, Supreme Court Chief Justice Isaac Amit earns a gross monthly salary of over NIS 120,000 (approximately $33,113), President Isaac Herzog NIS 68,000 ($18,764) and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu NIS 59,000 ($16,280).\nIncoming Supreme Court President Isaac Amit speaks at his swearing in ceremony at the President’s Residence in Jerusalem, February 13, 2025.

We earn a respectable enough salary and that is perfectly fine. Anyone who wants to earn more in the private sector can choose to go into the private sector.”\nIsrael is ranked fourth place in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) list of developed countries with the highest comparable prices, which the organization recently said were tied to a combination of geographical factors, trade barriers, and stringent product market regulation.\nOn January 1, Israelis were also hit with a series of tax increases, price hikes and utility cost rises affecting the prices of most transactions including groceries, cars and the cost of new apartments.\nIsraelis saw their take-home pay shrink further, with the sums deducted from paychecks toward the National Insurance Institute rising by an additional NIS 1,000 to NIS 2,000 a year for the average household.\nThe 2025 state budget, which was passed in March, included billions of shekels in coalition funds but failed to curb spending by multiple government ministries deemed superfluous by treasury officials.\nSharon Wrobel contributed to this report."}

Why wouldn’t they? It’s our war – and theirs by proxy. One of the most telling examples is our differing perceptions about bomb shelters. Israelis see them as life saving spaces protecting us from potential missile strikes. But outside of Israel the shelters are viewed negatively and many people are terrified to spend any time there.\nFor the second time in a matter of days the fear of bomb shelters by potential visitors has been a topic of conversation.\nIn the first incident North American guests invited to a family celebration in Israel are refusing to attend because they are too afraid of what will happen if the sirens sound and they literally have to take shelter — in a shelter.\n“I don’t think I could handle sitting in a bomb shelter,” said one guest who has decided to stay away. When the Israeli branch of the family heard that, they looked at each other with baffled consternation: “What? He has a problem with the bomb shelter? Why? What does he think happens in there? We’re only there for 10 minutes max. He can’t sit on a chair in our shelter for a few minutes? Even if he has snacks?”\nThen there’s another scenario. A family who frequently spend their summers in Israel is not coming this summer for fear that the sirens and the shelters will cause irrevocable emotional damage to their children. Some Israelis understand their concern — most do not.\nI don’t dare mention to either shelter-phobic friend that one of my children went through a phase about 10 years ago where he refused to go to the shelter when the sirens sounded because, as he said at the time: “If it’s my time to go then it’s my time.” He was the ripe old age of 16 when he said that.\nAt least twice since October 7, 2023, we have hosted strangers in our shelter. It’s not clear how they got there but it doesn’t really matter. Two of them were lying on the ground outside our house as my daughter raced home and she invited them in. They joined the conversation for a few minutes and then left. We even gave them snacks.\nBomb shelters in Israel have saved countless lives. They are built into houses and apartment buildings throughout the country. Having a protected space isn’t optional here. It’s been the law since 1951. The Civil Defense Law says that all residential, commercial and industrial construction built from that time forward, must include protected spaces.\nUnfortunately it wasn’t always a law and older buildings don’t have them. They are not like a few days in a five-star hotel, but being alive in a cramped shelter with your old paint cans, suitcases, and succah decorations is far better than being dead in a fancy hotel.\nSome apartment buildings don’t have individual protected space in each unit. They have one large shelter for everyone in the building. In one recent case the sirens sounded in the middle of the night and a lot of babies who lived in the building weren’t so happy about having their sleep disrupted. They arrived in the shelter crying until the older residents started singing to them in unison and they went back to sleep.\nMost of the time in the shelter during the past year and a half involved rounding up the people in the house, trying to find the dog, and entering the shelter for a few minutes. Once you heard the booms when the missiles were intercepted, you had to wait a few more minutes in case of falling debris and then you were free to leave. You could even take your shelter snacks with you.\nThere have been times in Israel’s modern history where people have been required to stay in their shelters for extended periods. That can’t have been fun. It required frequent forays for snacks and toilet relief, but it was survivable and far better than the alternative.\nIt’s impossible to guarantee visitors that they won’t have to go to shelters or lie down on the side of the road during this war. Our enemies are unpredictable at best. Fortunately, for the most part, they have lousy aim and we have impressive defenses. So should people stay away from Israel for fear of missiles? I am going to say no. There are snacks in the shelter."}

By chance, my festival was located in Shittim, a small southern community one hour north of Eilat, and not the Nova festival at Kibbutz Re’im in which over 360 concert-goers were murdered and dozens more taken captive. As I corresponded with my editor, trying to understand the gravity of the situation, I heard the sobs of others around me desperately trying to reach parents who lived in the Gaza envelope and others besides themselves with worry for friends who were already considered “missing” from the Nova festival.\nIn the months that followed, as I embarked upon my first full-time journalistic position covering Israel at war, I would often think about the mysterious workings of fate – why I woke up in a tent surrounded by panic but not terror, while peers of mine woke to gunfire and death. This arbitrary fortune haunted me throughout my reporting on the war that followed and to the present day.\nDocumenting horror: The trauma behind the byline\nTwo weeks after the attack, a nation – and me with it – reeling in shock, I found myself in a military auditorium north of Tel Aviv with about 200 other journalists. The Israeli military had assembled us to view 43 minutes of raw footage from the Hamas attack, taken from terrorists’ body cameras and phones, in order to combat online disinformation and increase sympathy for Israel’s plight.\nI watched as journalists from around the world reacted to the atrocities on screen. Some gasped in horror. Others stepped out early, unable to bear the images and sounds of civilians being murdered, children killed, and bodies burned. One French reporter later told me, “It was too much. I knew coming here that the hardest thing for me would not be the images but the sound, because you can close your eyes if the images are too much.”\nI, too, closed my eyes at times, unable to bear the graphic imagery. Already at this early stage, I worried about the long-term personal consequences of covering such a brutal and graphic war on my psyche. Later, a therapist I saw encouraged a strategy of dissociation: keep these memories in a “war binder” in your mind, separate from the rest of your being.\nEasier said than done.\nI stayed for the entire screening, taking notes, observing reactions, gathering quotes – doing my job as a journalist. But I couldn’t separate myself from what I was witnessing. These weren’t abstract victims in a faraway conflict. They were my compatriots. They could have been my friends, my family. They could have been me, had I chosen a different festival that weekend. I wrote the article, filed it on time, maintained the professional distance expected. But inside, something was breaking.\nThe faces behind the headlines\nThree days after the attack, I covered a press conference in Tel Aviv where relatives of missing American citizens pleaded for the US government’s help. Among them was Rachel Goldberg, mother of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who had been at the Supernova festival. She recounted how her son was last seen leaving a bomb shelter with his “arm severed,” and had reportedly helped save lives by tossing back grenades thrown into the shelter.\nI am an alumnus of the Pardes Institute for Jewish Studies, where Rachel worked as an educator before the war, and have prayed at the same synagogue as the Goldberg-Polins in Jerusalem. In the months that followed, I pleaded with my editors for even more opportunities to write about the hostage families, as if the scale of life or death was balanced precariously upon my pen.\nWhen the horrific news came that Hersh Goldberg-Polin had been brutally murdered in captivity alongside Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, and Ori Danino, I felt not only sadness but also guilt and shame that I had not done enough as a journalist. I visited the family’s mourning tent, this time not as a journalist but as a fellow grieving citizen who was burned out. I told Hersh’s father Jon that I would pay tribute to his son’s memory at the Ganges River – embarking on the pilgrimage that Hersh had planned on taking before he was taken too soon.\nFinding healing in the jungle\nIn the year since I left the country, I could not come close to leaving the war behind –  instead choosing to interview Gazan refugees in the Greek island of Samos, discuss the finer points of nonviolent philosophy in the context of Israel’s war with Buddhist monks in Dharamsala, and visit perhaps the most popular vacation destination for Israelis fleeing the war abroad: Thailand’s Koh Phangan.\nThat’s how I found myself at David’s Circle, intrigued by writing about a unique therapeutic refuge for Israelis who, in my mind, had suffered far worse than I: those who attended the other music festival, like David Newman of blessed memory, for whom the circle is named.\nExcept that when I sat down for coffee to discuss the story’s parameters with Yael Shoshani-Rom, founder of David’s Circle and trauma specialist, she quickly corrected my own dismissive attitude. Almost all those who attend the circle, she explained, feel like they are undeserving of treatment and that someone else suffered more and is thus even more worthy of healing.\nFor months, I’ve written thousands of words about this war – chronicling the hostages’ plight, the grieving families, the political tensions, the international reactions. But until now, I haven’t written a single word about my own experience.\nBrené Brown, the renowned researcher on vulnerability, writes that “owning our story and loving ourselves through that process is the bravest thing we’ll ever do.” For a journalist trained to remain objective and detached, acknowledging my own wounds felt like crossing a professional line. But here, in this lush Thai sanctuary, I began to understand what Brown means when she says that “when we deny our stories, they define us. When we own our stories, we get to write a brave new ending.”\nI went as a journalist, but I stayed as a participant. I’m so grateful for the opportunity to finally acknowledge my own pain in writing about this war as I pray for it to end soon."}

With his sons’ bodies before him in the Tabernacle, the Torah states: “Vayidom Aharon,”- “And Aaron was silent.” (Vayikra 10:3)\nCommentators throughout the ages have embraced Aaron’s response as a quiet nobility in the face of overwhelming loss. The Midrash even teaches that Aaron was rewarded with prophecy for his restraint. Approaching this episode through the prism of pain, Ramban holds that while Aaron did initially sob loudly, he quickly contained his grief.\nThe Medieval rabbinic commentator Ba’al HaTurim goes in a different direction, pointing out that “Vayidom” appears only one other time with the same spelling in all of Tanakh. Joshua 10:13 reads: “Vayidom Hashemesh” – “Then the sun stood still.” There, “Vayidom” isn’t about quiet; rather, it’s about stillness, the halting of time itself.\nThis other translation of “Vayidom” invites us to look at Aaron’s behavior in a new way. Perhaps what Aaron experienced is less about stoic silence than disorientation in the face of loss.\nAs many of us know, the loss of a loved one can upend our lives and make time lose meaning. Shiva itself can feel both like an eternity and a blink. In mourning, we may not know what to say, let alone move forward.\nNearly 30 years ago, when my father died, it was an unexpected life disruption. Even when we finally embraced that there would be no miracle cure for pancreatic cancer, it still seems hard to fathom that my father would go so quickly.\nJust after my father died, job search season commenced during my last year in rabbinical school. The bitter irony was that I entered into search when I was essentially lost on an emotional level.\nBut I wasn’t the only one. During shiva, multiple family members and close friends pulled me aside. Concerned about my mother, they suggested, “Look for a job in Boston, so you can take care of your mother. Maybe you should take a year off.” Their message was clear: my mother would need support as she shouldered the family business and took her place at the head of the dining room table.\nOne weekend, as my job search unfolded, I came home for Shabbat. Sitting at the kitchen table, my mother and I talked about the future, even though we were barely functioning in the present.\nAfter informing her of job openings in Chicago, LA, and Baltimore, I shared what was percolating inside: “Mom, I’m thinking about staying close to home.”\n“Are there any jobs up here?”\n“No.”\n“Why would you do that?” Her quizzical expression showed she wasn’t buying it.\n“To tell you the truth, some members of our family think you need help, and I want to do my part.”\nI expected relief and gratitude from my mother, but instead, courage and determination glared back at me. Suddenly, I remembered who I was talking to.\nWhen my father proposed to my mother, he said, “If you love me, you’ll move with me to Israel.” You have to understand that up until this time in her life, my mother had barely spent a night away from her parents’ home. Swept away by the man, the dream, and the family they dreamed of creating, this nineteen-year-old and her groom left for Israel two days after their wedding in 1960.\nNext to my gregarious father, my mother appeared to be a quiet, reserved presence. But all along, a courageous soul and humble persistence have guided her path and our family.\nThat night, in a home with palpable grief still lingering in the air, her blue eyes met mine as she asserted, “You have worked your whole life for this. You’re not coming home. Dad wouldn’t want it, and neither do I. You have to go!”\nWhen the conversation ended, I didn’t just get up from the kitchen table, I took my first steps towards healing. With my mother’s strength as my guide, time had resumed.\nIn the Torah, Aaron’s response to loss may have indeed been silence. Not because he was stoic or speechless, but because mourning and loss can be disorienting.\nBut Hashem never lets the story end there. Again and again, our tradition insists that “Acharei Mot”, after death, there will be a new chapter of life. And the first step forward awaits whenever we are ready to take it.\nDedicated in honor of my mother, Linda Mirkin Savenor, for Mother’s Day."}

Iran will be forced to dismantle its nuclear facilities or maybe just cease enrichment; maybe destroy its centrifuges “nicely” or have them blown up “viciously,” or maybe just promise not to use them to make weapons. Anyone trying to follow US President Donald Trump’s sudden and frequent policy lurches will be tempted to reach for the Dramamine. Politicians often change their minds – then-Senator John Kerry was famously for the war in Iraq before he was against it – but it’s safe to say no president has ever executed so many head-spinning, diametric reversals in so short a time. Four months have not yet passed since his inauguration.\nThis chaotic behavior, in my view, has two sources. The first is Trump’s desperate need to see himself as a winner (even if not actually winning). The second is competition for his attention among close advisors with very different views. Most relevant for Israel is the cleavage within his foreign-policy team. Vice President JD Vance, Susie Wiles, and Donald Trump Jr. lead a neo-isolationist cadre that gauges foreign relations in terms of transactional benefits to America. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz advocate a more assertive – and more traditionally Republican – US role in global affairs. Trump also pays attention to media gadflies such as Tucker Carlson and Laura Loomer, who serve as windows to the soul of his political base.\nTrump listens to these discordant voices and decides whose advice is likely, at a given juncture, to make him look like a winner. And he goes with that until it no longer feels like winning. Then he goes with someone else. The underlying merits and the repercussions are secondary or irrelevant. What counts is public perception, or at least how he reads it.\nUpon assuming office for the second time, Trump’s priority was to banish as much global conflict as possible so as to burnish his war-ending persona and draw a favorable contrast from his predecessor. That didn’t work so well with Russia and Ukraine, but like virtually all previous US presidents, he knew he could pressure Israel into supporting American priorities – in this case, a ceasefire with Hamas. It took Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by surprise but didn’t work out too badly for him, since a substantial segment of the Israeli public supported the agreement’s first phase and Netanyahu declined, without backlash, to pursue the far more controversial subsequent phases.\nPresident Donald Trump speaks while meeting with Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni (unseen) in the Oval Office of the White House, April 17, 2025, in Washington, as Vice President JD Vance, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth listen. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\nSince then, Trump has threatened Hamas with “hell to pay” if all hostages – or American hostages, or, right, actually all hostages – were not released; unleashed substantial firepower against Yemen’s Houthi rebels and threatened them with “complete annihilation”; and reimposed “maximum pressure” sanctions against Iran while threatening to destroy their nuclear facilities. These all bear the fingerprints of the muscular foreign-policy cadre.\nHamas neither released any hostages nor faced hell, Iran remained defiant, and the Houthis still managed to mount attacks against ships in the Red Sea, including American naval vessels. Plainly, none of this felt very much like winning. Soon, Trump was engaging in dialogue with Iran, which obliged him by muzzling the Houthis to “build momentum” in the talks – i.e., to hand Trump a win he could boast of and a debt to be collected later. The neo-isolationists now had the upper hand. Unsourced statements suggested Trump might even be considering a return to the terms of Obama’s disastrous nuclear deal with Iran, which would please the neo-isolationists since they don’t perceive Iran as a threat to US shores. But it ignited a firestorm among right-wing commentators, who reminded Trump how mightily he inveighed against that deal before dramatically exiting it in 2018. Manhood check! Trump quickly pivoted to “nicely” or “viciously” and postponed further talks.\nRead: Trump: Iran’s centrifuges will either ‘blow up nicely’ in a deal or ‘viciously’ without one\nWhat happens next? Talks with Iran are back on. The neo-isolationists perceive the vigor of Trump’s manly threats as cover for a renewed effort to accommodate the mullahs. If they can get some concession from Iran that arguably – even if not credibly – extends beyond the Obama deal, they think they can sell it to Trump as a momentous win. They have learned by now that no line he draws in the sand is fixed if its erasure can be spun favorably.\nIn the meantime, Trump’s team has been feeling out the possibility of bringing Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords – a signature Trump win in his first administration. Getting Saudi on board would not only gild that win but achieve what his hated predecessor, Joe Biden, sought strenuously but failed to obtain. The obstacles were, and remain, Saudi insistence on an end to the Gaza war and a pathway to Palestinian statehood as prerequisites.\nJoe Biden and his State Department seemed genuinely puzzled over Israel’s refusal on both counts. But they overestimated the value of Saudi normalization to Israel. The two countries have cooperated fruitfully and quietly since Obama signed his nuclear deal with Iran. The tangible benefits of normalization to Israel would be few, and the risks to the Saudi government significant. Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, is engaged in a long-term project of reforming and modernizing his country in the face of fierce opposition from religious fundamentalists and members of his own royal family. Attempts to placate the Palestinians would make recognition of the “Zionist entity” by the cradle of Islam no less of an abomination to religious zealots. And the Palestinians have always refused to be placated.\nOne can almost imagine bin Salman colluding with Netanyahu to keep the bar to normalization unachievably high, precisely to avoid upending the productive status quo. But Trump needs a win, and facts are beside the point. The Palestinians have had a Jew-free state in all of Gaza since 2005. We know how that experiment turned out. And ending the Gaza war on Hamas’s terms, which have not meaningfully changed since they perpetrated the horrors of October 7, would simply start the countdown to the next pogrom. We have experimental evidence for that proposition as well: Israel is fighting its fifth war with Hamas, having allowed it to survive and thrive after each of the previous four.\nThese are merely facts, however, and Trump needs a win. We’ll see how far he’s willing to go to get it, how eager MBS is to cooperate, and how much fortitude Netanyahu is prepared to show in defending Israel’s core interests. Rumor has Trump preparing to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. The perfidy and self-defeating destructiveness of such a move can’t be overstated. But in a Machiavellian world of princes and winners, nothing is unthinkable."}

The conversation – and the larger one surrounding the Israeli-Gazan conflict – has had a stranglehold over Jewish-American discourse for the better part of two years. I girded myself for the usual talking points. You know the ones. But when the discussion started, my father suggested, almost off-handedly, Trump’s interventions wouldn’t have been necessary “if Jews weren’t such wimps.”\nI blinked.\n“…wimps?”\n“Weak,” he amended. “Y’know – pussies.”\nMy father was born in Far Rockaway, Queens in 1952. It was a more physical world. Activism was sweaty. It played out on the streets, not screens. When he was a teenager, he witnessed the rise of the Black Panthers, the political and community organization founded by Bobby Seale and Huey Newton in Oakland, California in 1966. The group was based on the notion that if you were going to mess with Black America, Black America would mess back. Members were armed to the teeth as they escorted their own down the block, protecting them from police. When the California State Assembly gathered to discuss the Mulford Act – a measure which would ban the public carrying of firearms – Seale and others stood on the Assembly steps, rifles at attention like spears.\n“Why can’t we do that?” my father asked me. “Why can’t there be Jewish Black Panthers?”\nNever mind the more problematic elements of the Panthers – the internal strife, the shootouts with police. What my father really suggested was a new Jewish physicality. A security not in words, but presence.\nWhen I attended the ADL conference in New York in March, I was struck by the pride on display. Israeli actress Gal Gadot headlined the closing ceremony, bringing many to tears with her rallying cry, “my name is Gal, and I am Jewish.” Jewish college students spoke of their fears on campus to many an “Am Yisrael Chai.” When I was interviewed by Jewish comedians Judy Gold and Hughie Stone Fish, they were insistent I take out my chai necklace and show it to the world. This pride was channeled into speaking out on socials, putting pressure on colleges and other institutions to review their security protocols, and generally shed light on the antisemitic experiences faced by so many each day.\nBut not once, during the entirety of the proceedings, was there a call to flood the campuses themselves – no thought that perhaps all the thousands in attendance would better flex their solidarity out there, on the streets, protecting their own, shoulder-to-shoulder. The fervor was left to evaporate. A boiling pool of frustration and fear, steamed off.\n“This is what they’re always accusing us of,” my father said. The they in question doesn’t matter. There’s always a they. “If someone gets in our face, we use the law. We use money. Very different from a ‘fuck you’ and punch to the teeth.”\nThe entire premise of my novel spirals round this idea. When our protagonist, Arthur, discovers he’s part of an ancient line of fantastical Jewish demon hunters, his first response isn’t excitement, but incredulity. “There’s something sexy about a demon-hunting priest,” he muses. “The righteous man of the collar hunting vampires and things that go bump in the night, armed only with his cross, his faith, and a precious vial of holy water. Yet you take that same religious man and call him a Rabbi, arm him with a shofar and Hebrew, and what was once a haunting tale turns comical in the telling.” Jews can’t be demon hunters because that’d mean they have to be cool first.\nThe current of Jewish emasculation runs deep. In his speech to the Second Zionist Congress in 1898, Max Nordau spoke of the need for a new “muscular Jew.” For too long, the Jews had held up a mirror to themselves and saw the reflection the world gave them: passive. Atrophied. We were once inheritors to the great strength of Samson and the Maccabees, but had gone soft. A new virility was needed. “We will develop wide chests, strong arms and legs,” Nordau said. “A brave look.” This, in contrast to the eydlkayt. The bleary-eyed scholar, gentle and wise. The pussy.\nThe Jewish story\nMuch has been made of the Jews as the “chosen people.” Critics use the phrase against us to suggest that we believe ourselves exalted over others. Rabbis have argued we are chosen not to rule, but that together with all people, facilitate a better tomorrow.\nI believe it’s not necessarily Jews, but the Jewish story that is chosen. More than science or faith, narrative is the best tool for meaning-making that all human beings have, and ours is one for the ages. Jewish struggles teach to love the stranger. Jewish triumphs are tales of resilience and hope. For thousands of years we have offered ourselves up as the great story in the hopes others might study it and be better for it. But in the wake of October 7th, many Jews no longer have a stomach for forbearance. We have put our faith in learning and in education, in letters. Yet fresh images of our dead children pile upon the old, and we wonder: why must it be their blood that teaches? Why must it be us on the stage, in the spotlight, our tragedies performed time after time as ritual for mankind?\nHistorically, American Jews have supported the Democratic Party and the ideas it espouses: diversity. Tolerance. Speaking truth to power. The old wisdom held it was these values in which we could take shelter. After all, protecting minorities included ourselves; we would only ever be as safe as our multicultural democracy. It’s not that we didn’t value security, or unity, or tradition, but that those who acted in their names historically did so at our expense. Which is why Trump’s recent crackdowns on collegiate antisemitism have cast a pall of ambivalence over American Jewry. For the first time, the sword of power swings down and it’s them, not us, under its shadow. Them the immigrant. Them the Muslim. And what’s more, the sword falls in our name.\nThe reversal intoxicates and terrifies us. A part of us cheers when our safety is made paramount. No diverse coalition. No hiding our needs behind universalism. This is our pain – ours – and we will end it ourselves. You mess with Jews, Jews mess back. We won’t wait until we’re dead for you to love us. We don’t need your love at all. We’re done asking for it.\nBut of course, we’re not ending the pain ourselves. Trump is. It’s not our sword, but his. Not our voice, our judgement. We are ceding it in the hopes that the blade will never turn on us, even when the others whispering in the president’s ear are antisemites. Are we so desperate to retch up our emasculation that we would arm the man who softened Jewish experiences during the Holocaust, who says nothing of sieg heils at his party convention or assumption of power, who tells us who is and isn’t one of our own? As Wesleyan University president Michael S. Roth recently opined, “these are our defenders?”\n“It isn’t good,” my father said.\n“What isn’t?” I asked.\n“The disappearing of these Hamas protestors. Swarming them on the street. No warrant. Throwing them down in Louisiana or wherever.”\nI agreed, but played devil’s advocate to coax more out. There’s some comfort in knowing a truth, but even more in hearing it echoed back to you.\n“Aren’t the President’s actions showing Jews mean business?” I suggested. “That we’re not wimps?”\nMy father shook his head.\n“If you’re playing ball and the other guy’s frustrating you, the solution isn’t to get the bully to steal the ball. Otherwise, the game’s up. Can’t change the rules of free speech or due process just to feel safer. That’s how Democracy itself goes down.”\n“Such sagely language, Dad,” I said. “Where’d you pick that wisdom up? Getting into scraps in Far Rockaway?”\nHe threw his hands behind his head.\n“Nah. I guess that came from shul.”"}

That regret over the stories never told struck a special chord, particularly as both VE (Victory in Europe) Day and, in America, Mother’s Day, approached.\nDuring the war and afterwards, my mother was involved in US economic intelligence activities. Before her death, she dropped a few hints about what she did. It was only as I researched her life decades later, however, that some details emerged, even as large holes remained.\nOn May 9, 1945, Germany surrendered. Just two months later, my mom, a single woman a few weeks short of her 26th birthday, was granted the equivalent of the military rank of captain and sent to Germany to work with the US occupation government. Her parents, Yiddish-speaking Orthodox Jewish immigrants who’d come to America from Eastern Europe before the First World War, were not happy.\nCharlotte Katz Millenson was one of the super-sharp graduates of New York City’s Hunter College back when it was a women-only school whose free tuition was a magnet to families struggling during the Great Depression. When Charlotte’s parents moved to Washington, DC so her dad to could take over a laundry business, she soon followed.\nI interviewed my mom and dad a couple of years before her death in 1993, a time when her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease made it difficult to speak at length. She mentioned something about analyzing intercepted economic messages where she was working prior to going overseas. Her Civil Service records, which I found in my research, told a more dramatic story. The blandly named Foreign Economic Administration that she joined in 1944 was charged with analyzing thousands of intercepted German communications to help guide Allied bombing raids on economic targets.\nIn 1945, Charlotte transferred to the War Department as a civilian “financial reports specialist.” Shortly after, she was given a pay raise, a rank, a uniform and flown to Frankfurt on a military transport. While working there, she photographed a white building that was the Military Government’s headquarters and formerly housed the headquarters of chemical company IG Farben. It wasn’t widely known then that Farben made the Zyklon B gas used for mass murder in the concentration camps. I wonder what my mother thought later looking at that picture.\nIn January 1946, Charlotte was transferred to Berlin. It was in Berlin that she participated in the interrogation of Albert Speer, the man Adolf Hitler appointed to oversee German’s wartime economy. That interrogation, my research showed, was part of a confidential US project designed both to evaluate the effectiveness of the Allied bombing and to gather German industrial secrets before the Russians could obtain them.\nWhat was it like for Charlotte to come face-to-face with Hitler’s Minister of Armaments and War, knowing the massive destruction wreaked by those armaments? What questions was she allowed to ask? Meanwhile, there’s a photo of my mom posing with a Russian soldier, his left arm around her shoulder, both smiling, as he guarded the ruins of the bunker where Hitler committed suicide days before the war’s end. What were her feelings standing at the entrance to the Führerbunker, literally walking in Hitler’s footsteps? One more untold story. And there were others.\nThough I obviously can’t know for sure why my mom didn’t speak more and in more detail about her experiences, I have some guesses. There was, naturally, the confidentiality component, even years later. Moreover, my mom was often reticent to talk too much about herself; my dad was more the raconteur.\nBut I also think there may have been more personal reasons. After the war, it took Charlotte a while to land a job that wasn’t secretarial. Then, after a few years as a junior economist at the World Bank, she met my father, got married and had my sister, brother and me. Her full-time job became raising three smart, verbal, difficult children on the modest salary of a husband working for the government and a non-profit. It was by no means easy. She did it well and with love. Yet part of her, I think now, remained frustrated. One reason Charlotte may have been reluctant to share more stories about her experiences may have been because of the memories they conjured at a time when “housewife” was the only role she could play.\nIn  the song “Free Man in Paris,” Joni Mitchell sings: “I was a free man in Paris, I felt unfettered and alive.” My mom was, indeed, free in Paris, visiting there twice with friends, and, as a surviving letter to her mom shows, did feel “unfettered and alive,” as the song put it. It was the same in Germany. As Atina Grossman writes in the book Jews, Germans and Allies: Close Encounters in Occupied Germany, for the young men and women in the Military Government, this was “the great adventure of their lives.” Enjoying the benefits of dominance and affluence in a defeated nation, there were dates and parties, “drinking and playing and romancing.”\nI value what I uncovered about Charlotte as an intelligence analyst, and, like those interviewed in the documentary series, wish I’d known more. Had there been more time ­– if she hadn’t fallen ill, if we had reached the point in our lives where we knew better what to ask and how to listen – it might have been different. But the influence that continues to resonate throughout my life is from the love that came from Charlotte Katz Millenson, mom."}

Personally, I find podcasts to be great company during the mundane moments of daily life — whether I’m driving, folding laundry, or chopping vegetables. One of my favorites is “Honestly,” with Bari Weiss, who brings thoughtful and provocative voices to the table. Recently, she interviewed Douglas Murray, a fierce and articulate defender of Israel. During their conversation, she referred to his appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience.” For those unfamiliar, Joe Rogan is one of the most popular podcasters in the world, with over 14 million listeners. With a long afternoon of cooking ahead of me, I queued up the 2.5 hour episode as background for my slicing and stirring.\nIn that episode, Murray joined comedian and political commentator Dave Smith for what was intended to be a civil and productive conversation about the Israel-Hamas war. Predictably, Smith accused Israel of committing genocide and war crimes, painting vivid images of starving children and crying infants trapped beneath Gaza’s rubble. Murray countered with facts and historical context, noting, for example, that the combatant-to-civilian death ratio in this war is lower than in most other modern conflicts. But Smith, instead of engaging with the data, responded emotionally. He asked Murray if he had children, implying that no parent could ever justify what Israel was doing — regardless of military necessity or moral complexity.\nThis line of argument is not new. What struck me, however, was something that was missing — not just from this debate, but from so many others like it. No one talks about the young Israeli soldiers. No one mentions the 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds who would rather be studying in university, learning Torah in yeshiva, going to parties, standing up for social justice, or even just arguing about politics with their family and friends. These are young men and women who generally do not want to put on uniforms, pick up weapons, and enter urban war zones. They do not really want to spend these days of their youth blowing up buildings, destroying property, or facing the trauma of combat.\nBut they do it.\nThey serve because they must — because their families, their friends, and their homeland depend upon them. They are not aggressors; they are defenders. They didn’t start this war, and they pray every day for it to end. They wear their uniforms not out of hatred, but out of love: love for their people, love for their land, and love for the future they hope to help build.\nThirty-eight years ago, my sister-in-law and brother-in-law, Judy and Baruch Sterman, made aliyah and settled in Efrat. Despite the 5,700 miles between us, our families have always remained close, showing up for each other at joyful simchas and at more difficult times. Judy and Baruch are blessed with six sons and one daughter.\nAt the start of this war, three of the Sterman children were called up for service. Eyal, the youngest of the crew, had just completed his training and was serving in Yahalom, an elite combat engineering unit. He later became an officer. It was hard for us to wrap our heads around the idea that our sweet, smiley, good-natured, and still-very-young nephew was now a commander in the Israeli army.\nOne of our favorite memories of Eyal is from the bar mitzvah of one of his older brothers. On Friday night, he stood in the middle of his parents’ living room and practiced singing “Anim Zemiros,” which he would recite the next morning during the synagogue service, with such excitement and heart. He was just a little boy then; how could that same child now be leading other young men into combat? We were so proud of him, and, of course, deeply worried. The fear that something could happen to him, or to his brothers, was constant.\nAs the war went on, Eyal’s brothers eventually completed their reserve duty and returned home, some of that constant anxiety lifted.\nTwo weeks ago, however, we received the devastating news that Eyal had been hit by a sniper in Gaza. At first, we didn’t know how serious his injury was. A fellow soldier on a tank had been shot, and Eyal, without hesitation, ran up onto the tank to help him. That’s when the sniper’s bullet struck his left arm. He fell backwards into the tank, hitting his head, but even so, he managed to apply a tourniquet to his own wounded arm and send a WhatsApp message calling for help.\nDespite his bravery and the quick response, Eyal’s injury was severe. His arm had to be amputated below the elbow.\nSince that day, Eyal has been surrounded by unwavering love and support from his parents, his siblings, and his extended family in the IDF. His courage and resilience have touched the hearts of people from all backgrounds and communities. In his merit, the Book of Tehillim (Psalms) has been recited around the world, tzedakah (charity) has been given, challah has been baked, and countless acts of kindness have been performed. During his time in the hospital, Eyal attended the funeral of another fellow soldier. The emotional pain and the physical loss would seem to be too much to bear for anyone — how can a young person heal inside and out?\nEyal’s is one story, our family’s story, but sadly, his is far from the only one. There are so many families carrying stories like his. Stories of sons, daughters, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews. Young people should be exploring life, not fighting for it. Young people deserve more out of life. They do not deserve the physical and constant emotional sacrifices that the Hamas terrorists and their allies have forced upon us.\nWhen podcasters and news reporters speak about war, when they debate politics or report the latest headlines, do they ever stop to think about the human beings behind the IDF uniforms? The young men and women of the IDF are not faceless figures in a conflict; they are beloved children, siblings, and friends. They are students, dreamers, musicians, and Torah learners. They are people like Eyal, who ran into danger to save someone else. As the world debates Israel’s right to defend itself, let’s remind the world of the emotional and physical cost borne by its holy defenders. Their stories need to be told and heard."}
{"website": "timesofisrael", "url": null, "link": "https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/saying-thank-you-is-not-just-polite-but-holy/", "title": "Saying thank you is not just polite, but holy", "media_type": "blog", "date": "MAY 9, 2025, 3:13 PM", "content": "A few months ago, I noticed that my kids often weren’t saying thank you to people in service roles — baristas, cab drivers, librarians. I tried gentle reminders with mixed results. So one day, I sat them down and explained a concept from Jewish tradition: Kiddush Hashem.\nThe phrase literally means “sanctifying God’s name.” When people observe a committed Jew living with integrity, the Talmud explains, they should declare: “Fortunate is his teacher; fortunate is his God.”\nThis reframe changed everything. Now, when we leave a store or step out of a cab, I whisper “Kiddush Hashem” to my kids and they light up. They say thank you with real gusto, even a sense of purpose.\nAt first, I was just grateful it worked. Only later did I begin to understand why.\n* * *\nI’ve never found “holy” to be a particularly usable word. When someone dies, we speak of them as kind, generous, principled — but rarely as holy. Holiness tends to register as irrational or out of reach.\nThe anthropologist Richard Shweder describes the “ethic of divinity” as a framework in which human beings are seen not just as autonomous individuals, but as vessels of the sacred. In much of the West, this ethic has faded. In its place is the ethic of autonomy: be yourself, and do no harm. In such a framework, holiness is almost unintelligible.\nYet, in the heart of Leviticus — at the beginning of this week’s second Torah portion, Kedoshim — the Torah delivers one of its most radical commands: “You shall be holy.” Not as a dream or as an ideal, but as a duty.\nFor years, I searched Leviticus for echoes of modern sensibilities — the social justice of caring for the vulnerable, loving your neighbor, building a just society. But lately, I’ve been drawn to the ways Leviticus doesn’t fit our categories — the demands it makes that feel unfamiliar or uncomfortable. I’ve begun to ask more seriously: What does it mean to be holy? And why does the Torah demand it?\nThe Hebrew word for holiness — kodesh — is notoriously difficult to translate. It shows up across the Jewish tradition in strikingly different contexts. Shabbat is kadosh, set apart from the six ordinary days that precede it. A marriage is formalized through kiddushin, a ritual that sanctifies exclusivity. In synagogue, we recite kedusha, one of our most central prayers, proclaiming God’s holiness. The opposite of kodesh isn’t evil. It’s hol — mundane, everyday.\nAt the beginning of Kedoshim, Rashi defines holiness as separation from immorality, particularly in sexual conduct. Nachmanides goes further, arguing that holiness means elevating what is permitted — not living coarsely, even when we technically could. The Sages in the Midrash take it in another direction: kedusha means imitating divine traits.\nWith so many definitions, holiness can seem too vague to be useful. But I don’t think it is. My claim is this: despite the diversity of interpretations, there is a thread that runs through nearly every use of the term. Holiness marks something as consequential. Kedusha is what we call something when it matters at a different level.\nShabbat isn’t holy because the weekdays are profane. It is holy because it gestures toward something beyond — a rhythm that interrupts our ownership of time. A marriage isn’t holy because other relationships are meaningless. It is holy because it binds two people in a covenant that is especially consequential.\nAnd the radical claim of our Torah portion is that this can happen not just with sacred rituals, but in nearly any domain of life. Kedusha rests on the belief that everything can be elevated and made meaningful. That we can consecrate conversation, intimacy, even commerce.\nThe Torah’s exhortation of “Kedoshim tiheyu” — You shall be holy — is not a spiritual status we inherit. It’s a charge. A possibility. We can choose to make something holy. The Torah’s version of holiness is one of the most human-affirming ideas we have inherited: that God has given us the ability to make ordinary things matter.\nAnd that, I think, is what Kedoshim is trying to teach us. Holiness isn’t a feeling. It isn’t a private spiritual state, or a label reserved for religious virtuosos. Kedusha is treating life like it matters — the belief that our time can become sacred.\n* * *\nWhich brings me back to my kids. I had thought they weren’t saying thank you because they didn’t know better. But maybe they were just waiting to be told that their small actions matter. That something as quick as a thank you really makes a difference.\nC.S. Lewis once wrote: “How little people know who think that holiness is dull. When one meets the real thing, it is irresistible.”\nHoliness makes life feel thick with purpose. When we encounter the real thing, we don’t want to walk away."}
{"website": "timesofisrael", "url": null, "link": "https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/what-can-rob-lowe-teach-us-about-israel/", "title": "What can Rob Lowe teach us about Israel?", "media_type": "blog", "date": "MAY 7, 2025, 12:47 PM", "content": "I’m a child of the ’80s. I know the soundtrack to Pretty in Pink better than I know my kids’ phone numbers. Back in the day, my walls were plastered with Michael J. Fox and Kirk Cameron “pin-ups,” carefully removed from the middle of Teen Beat. So when I heard about a game show hosted by Brat Pack poster boy Rob Lowe, I was the first to jump on the couch to give it a try. Little did I realize how that bid for nostalgia would end up illuminating some key differences between American and Israeli culture.\nIf you’ve yet to see it, The Floor is a quiz show where players stand on squares in a giant grid. Each contestant picks their category — like Furry Animals, Flags, or ’80s TV shows — and defends their square of territory by competing in head-to-head duels with their neighbors. Win the duel, steal the square. The player with the most territory at the end wins $250,000.\nOnce our family started watching, we realized the challenge is more about speed than smarts. Identifying a glass of water in the Beverage category or the Nike logo in the Corporations category kept us entertained for a bit, as did Lowe’s charm and looks. But neither were compelling enough for long-term loyalty. Just when we were ready to move on, we discovered that Israel had launched its own version of The Floor — and suddenly, we were all in again.\nI thought that HaZira, or The Arena, would help us learn random Hebrew words like “armadillo” or “carbonated.” But there was nothing random about the interactions, categories, and atmosphere of HaZira. Watching it alongside The Floor gave us a crash course in cultural contrasts.\nLet’s start with the hosts, for example. Lowe is friendly, but reserved with the contestants. He aims to connect more with the audience, like with a knowing look to the camera when a contestant doesn’t recognize a movie he starred in, or a “complaint” that People never chose him as its Sexiest Man Alive. He’ll banter with the prettier contestants, but most players get a polite handshake and a formal “Good luck,” as they come and go off the stage. After a contestant wins a tough round, Lowe offers something simple, like “Nicely done,” while the camera pans to contestants watching quietly from their spots on the floor. \nThe contestants follow Lowe’s lead, with comments that sound scripted by ChatGPT: “I came to win!” or “That was intense.” Since you don’t get a lot of genuine emotion or natural humor, the game’s atmosphere feels more like a waiting room than a living room. \nUnlike Lowe, HaZira’s host, Reshef Levi, engages with the contestants like a nosy neighbor. When a contestant whose day job is a delivery driver comes up on stage, Levi ribs him, “Are you sure you know the way? You’re not going to get lost, right?” The contestant banters back, “I’ll find the address before you find a good punchline!” Meanwhile, another contestant from the floor yells out, “Stop talking, I’m so nervous for him!” Everyone laughs together.\nBoth HaZira players and Levi make unscripted jokes. Levi often addresses the loser of a round before congratulating the winner. And winners often hug their opponent with a loud “Kol HaKavod,” in appreciation, as the rest of the players cheer them off the stage. \nLevi also isn’t your typical heartthrob game show host. He is best known as a writer and producer behind some of Israel’s most iconic movies and TV shows, and was also the official playwright of HaBima, Israel’s national theater. One of his biggest TV hits is HaBorer (The Arbitrator), about a crime family whose boss settles underworld disputes by quoting Torah passages. The show became a cultural phenomenon in Israel — and is one of my personal favorites.\nWhile Lowe grew up in a fairly conventional family in Ohio, Levi’s family embodies the struggles and triumphs of Israel’s history. Levi’s father, an immigrant from Yemen, joined the Hagana and other pre-state Jewish defense groups as a teenager. The British jailed Eliyahu Levi when he was 16, and later deported him to an internment camp in Carthago, Sudan. Reshef Levi is one of eight children and has seven children himself. He created a series called Carthago with one of his brothers about their father’s personal story, which he says left a lasting imprint on his upbringing. Another of his brothers, Regev, died when both were in their early 20s, just starting their careers. To honor this brother, Levi signs his written works with the name “Reshef v’Regev Levi,” instead of just his own. \nThese acts of remembrance say so much about Levi himself, but also reflect the deeper cultural contrasts that show up in HaZira. Like how it’s perfectly acceptable for the contestants to wear anything from shorts and t-shirts to Jewish star necklaces to a kippah and even payos. Or how a Haredi contestant might face off against a tattooed guy in a tie-dyed shirt. The winner might go up against a gay, Christian Arab whose family came as refugees from the Lebanese civil war and who works as a pro-Israel advocate. On the other hand, most of the Americans on The Floor come in a uniform of brightly colored clothes likely dictated by producers. Their makeup looks perfect, but we don’t learn anything about their personal family histories.\nThe categories contestants choose also say a lot about each culture. Where The Floor categories are often sterile like “Dog Breeds” or “US Presidents,” HaZira’s more culturally personal categories include “Mizrahi Divas” and “Army Slang.” Answers in the “Holidays” category include Simchat Torah, Sukkot, and Tu B’Shvat. These categories don’t just require knowing random — and often pretty obvious — facts. They require shared experiences and history you can only understand if you’ve lived them. \nIt’s that feeling of connection that’s at the heart of the difference between Israeli and American culture. Where Americans often value individualism, surface-level interactions, and glossy looks, Israelis tend to prioritize community, directness, and stories that reflect real struggle and resilience.\nAmerican style is easier, but it doesn’t typically lead to closeness. Rob Lowe wants you to know about — and maybe even be jealous of — his accomplishments and good looks. Reshef Levi wants you to know about his father’s — and Israel’s — struggle for freedom. He wants to share his success with his late brother. It’s no wonder the US faces an epidemic of loneliness, but Israel does not.\nThis is the difference that sets Israeli culture apart, as Dan Senor and Paul Singer describe in The Genius of Israel. They highlight how emotional honesty, deep personal bonds, and a sense of shared purpose are what keep Israelis moving forward in the face of existential threat. Senor and Singer interview Lior Raz, creator of the hit show, Fauda, who emphasizes how important personal connection is: “Stories are everywhere in this country. It’s how we cope. It’s how we make sense of things.”\nMaybe that’s why someone who writes and produces stories for a living is better able to connect with his on-stage and off-stage audiences than someone who reads scripted lines for a living — even if he does have the prettier face.\nSo sure, I came for Rob Lowe and ’80s nostalgia. But I uncovered a profound lesson: authenticity runs way deeper than even the most sparkly façade. Israel reminds us that the best stories aren’t the most polished ones. They’re the ones we share together."}

One who loves others", "media_type": "blog", "date": "MAY 9, 2025, 2:48 PM", "content": "The fundamental principle of the Torah, according to Rabbi Akiva (Sifra Kedoshim 2), is love of the other: “Love thy neighbor as thyself” (Lev. 19:18). Yet it seems that most of us have the inverse wish: for the other to love us. The path laid down by Rabbi Akiva, as this short story by Hermann Hesse will show, is the way to happiness:\nThere was once an expectant woman who sought out a pious man to bless the fetus in her womb. The pious man promised the woman to bless her with the blessing of her choice, and she asked that all of the child’s acquaintances love it. The pious man hesitated, and asked her if she was certain about her choice of blessing. But when she insisted, he blessed the fetus as she requested. The woman gave birth to a boy, and the blessing was fulfilled: everyone loved the child. Yet, that love made them pardon his bad behavior, and he grew up to become corrupt. One day, he discovered the source of his misery and went to the pious man to reverse the blessing: rather than be loved by all, he asked to love all. Thus he became a happy man.\nA similar point is made by Orson Welles in his seminal film Citizen Kane, whose titular character grows up parentless and becomes immensely wealthy. Throughout his adult life, he uses his money to gain popularity, but ultimately dies alone in his colossal mansion, a single last word on his lips: “Rosebud.” The film follows the doomed efforts of a journalist to find out who or what is “rosebud.” In the end, we learn that “rosebud” is a small object from Kane’s childhood, the sole thing to which he was truly connected.\nIt is a secret known to every parent: generally speaking, parents express love for their children far more than the other way around. Usually it is the parent who is the lover and the children who are loved, yet the exquisite pleasure of this love is experienced by the parent.\nTrue love has value in itself, and when it is not authentic it is worthless. This is an insight that informs our behavior in many ways. Often, people will act or refrain from action, consciously or not, out of concern for their popularity. But when we are guided by commitment to loving rather than being loved, we are free to do the right thing, even if it is unpopular.\nWho Is Loved? One Who Loves Others\nThe truth is that in order to be loved one must love. As the story goes, Rabbi Hayim of Volozhin and his students once had to traverse a dangerous forest. At one point they were accosted and surrounded by brigands who informed them that they were going to steal their money and then murder them. Rabbi Hayim asked the robbers to give him and his students a few minutes to prepare for death, during which he stared into the face of the band’s leader. Soon, the leader yelled, “Run!” and Rabbi Hayim and his students escaped. When his students asked him how he had effected such a miracle, he replied, “When the brigands told us they would murder us, I was filled with anger and hate. But I did not want to leave this world feeling anger and hate, so, in order to overcome those emotions, I forced myself to empathize with the brigands. It appears that no one had ever looked at their leader with such an emotion, for he was unable to harm us.”\nThis insight also appears in Proverbs: “As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man” (27:19). Rashi explains in his commentary on the Talmud (Yevamot 117a): “As with the water that one observes and sees in it a face that is like one’s own – when one smiles it smiles and when he frowns it frowns – so, too, the heart of one human to another human; if one loves the other, the other loves one back.”\nLove for Near and Far\nChristianity took Judaism to task over the verse “Love thy neighbor as thyself,” claiming that it limited the recipients of love to one’s neighbors while, clearly, such love should be extended to all of humanity. That claim is refuted in the same chapter, when the Torah explicitly writes, “And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land…thou shalt love him as thyself” (Lev. 19:33–34). The stranger and the neighbor are mentioned in separate verses in order to give voice to the understanding that love begins from the natural, closer sphere and extends outward from there – from the near to the far.[1]\nIndeed, some people get stuck in the first stage, their love doomed to remain confined within their immediate circle, but it seems that trying to bypass that stage only exacerbates the problem. Absent love for those who are close to us, “love for all” can become an empty, sanctimonious slogan rather than an expression of authentic emotion. The fully egalitarian approach is often permeated with alienation. As the journalist Yair Sheleg once asked: how is it that the more a society talks about humanism, the more its members are alienated from one another?\nThe truth is, the verse teaches us that love must begin even closer to home. The Torah tells us to love the other like “ourselves,” meaning that self-love comes first. People who are not at peace with themselves, who hate and do not accept themselves, will ultimately treat the other in the same vein.\nI Am the Lord\nThe verse that enjoins to “love thy neighbor as thyself” ends with the phrase “I am the Lord.” What is the connection between loving the other and God? According to the Zohar, God is present whenever there is love among friends:\nThose companions, when they sit as one, not separating from each other…. What does the Holy One say? “Look, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell gam yaĥad,” “also together!” – gam, also, including Shekhina with them. Furthermore, the blessed Holy One listens to their utterances and is pleased and delights with them…and for your sake, peace will prevail in the world, as it is written, “For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, ‘Peace be within thee’ (Ps. 122:8).” (Zohar, Aĥarei Mot 59b)\nIn Mishna Avot (3:24), Rabbi Akiva – he who enshrined “love thy neighbor” as the quintessential Torah precept – teaches that “beloved is man, since he is created in the image [of God]. A deeper love – it is revealed to him that he is created in the image, as it says (Gen. 9:6): ‘For in the image of God made He man.’” God’s special affection for humanity is due to its divine dimension, having been created in His image. God dwells within every human being."}

My name is Hallel, and I’m a liberal Zionist activist. I had a safe, legal abortion here in Israel two months ago. So yeah, we’re going to get into it—quickly and unapologetically.\nBecause lately, I’ve seen something deeply concerning: the way abortion rights are being linked with slogans like “Free Palestine” on protest signs, clinic doors, and Instagram carousels. At first glance, it might seem progressive, intersectional, or even brave to the average scroller. But let me be clear—it’s not just confusing. It’s harmful.\nAbortion Clinics Should Be Safe Spaces—Not Political Battlegrounds\nAbortion access is a human right. It’s a critical part of healthcare that must be safe, legal, and accessible to *everyone*. Clinics should be sanctuaries—places where women can make decisions about their bodies without fear, shame, or politicization.\nWhen you slap “Free Palestine” on the front of an abortion clinic, you’re not making that space more inclusive. You’re making it political. And politics—especially when they carry deeply divisive or weaponized rhetoric—have no place in a space meant to prioritize safety and bodily autonomy for all.\nBecause here’s the truth: Muslim women, Jewish women, Israeli women, Palestinian women, women of every identity and belief system—*all women*—need access to reproductive care. And when you politicize that access, you alienate some of the very people you claim to fight for.\nLet’s Talk About the Facts\nHere in Israel, abortion is legal. It’s safe. It’s accessible. There are committees, yes, but nearly all requests are approved. I’m living proof of that. I had access to the care I needed without shame or obstruction.\nUnder the Palestinian Authority? Under Hamas? That care doesn’t exist. Abortion is heavily restricted, if not outright illegal. There are no exceptions for rape. None for incest. None for fetal abnormalities. There’s almost no medical infrastructure, no systemic support. Women often resort to unsafe procedures—if they’re even able to find any option at all.\nSo when I see slogans like “Fund Abortion, Not War” or activists in red triangle t-shirts claiming solidarity with oppressed women by pushing a false narrative that erases the real conditions on the ground, it’s not just annoying. It’s dangerous.\nThat’s not solidarity.\nThat’s not activism.\nIt’s slacktivism.\nIt’s Western, Instagrammable, out-of-touch, and self-serving.\nMy Jewish Values Are Pro-Choice\nJudaism is clear: the life and health of the woman come first. Jewish law doesn’t just allow for abortion—it mandates it when the mother’s life is at risk. And in a world where women’s rights are constantly under siege, that clarity matters.\nI’m proud to say I accessed safe abortion care in the Jewish state. And I’m horrified that, during the same month, women across the United States were being denied that same right. That girls were bleeding out in hospital waiting rooms because doctors were too afraid to treat them. That people were watching their daughters suffer because saving them could cost a physician their license.\nSo if you really care about reproductive rights—about autonomy, about equity—then I ask you to pause. Reflect. And stop using abortion access as a backdrop for your unrelated political agenda.\nBecause no woman should feel unsafe walking into a clinic.\nNot because of protesters on the right screaming Bible verses—and not because of performative allies on the left projecting slogans that erase or distort complex realities.\nIf you want to support women’s rights? Start by making clinics safe again—for *everyone*. That includes Jews.\nAnd as for the rest of your gimmicks?\nThe tees. The slogans.\nThe lazy performance.\nYou can keep them.\nThey’re not helping anyone."}

He was kidnapped from his base during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led onslaught that started the war in Gaza.

The officials who spoke with The Times of Israel said that — contrary to Hamas’s claim — no direct talks were held between the terror group and the US.\nHamas in its statement also said that it was prepared to enter intensified negotiations aimed at reaching a final agreement to end the war, establish a mutually “agreed prisoner exchange, and enable Gaza to be administered by an independent professional authority.”\nHamas uses the term “prisoner exchange” to refer to the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian security prisoners, including terrorists convicted of murdering Israelis.\nPalestinian security inmates released by Israel as part of a hostage release-ceasefire deal with Hamas are welcomed by family members as they arrive on buses to the European hospital in Khan Younis on February 1, 2025.

I look very much forward to that day of celebration!”\nQatar and Egypt welcomed the news in a joint statement, calling it “a gesture of goodwill and an encouraging step toward a return to the negotiating table to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, the release of prisoners and detainees, and ensure the safe and unhindered flow of aid to address the tragic conditions in the Strip.”\nThe US did not brief Israel on the effort to release Alexander until after the deal with Hamas was reached, the source familiar with the details of Alexander’s release told The Times of Israel.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsrael was generally aware that efforts were ongoing, but only knew about them from its own intelligence operations.

(Photo by Jim WATSON / AFP)\nNetanyahu’s office confirmed that the US had informed Israel that Hamas would release Alexander “without any compensation or conditions,” and as a gesture of goodwill to the US.\n“The US conveyed to Israel that this move is expected to lead to negotiations for the release of additional hostages, based on the original Witkoff proposal — which Israel has already accepted,” said the PMO in a statement, referring to a framework that sources have told The Times of Israel was in fact proposed by Israel, under which around half the living hostages would go free in exchange for an extended truce, with the rest being later freed in exchange for an end to the war.\nIsrael was making preparations for the potential release, the PMO continued, adding that “according to Israeli policy, the negotiation will take place under fire, with a firm commitment to achieving all the objectives of the war.”\nEarlier Sunday, multiple reports quoted Netanyahu as telling the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that Hamas could release Alexander during Trump’s visit, and welcomed the possibility, adding: “These are very critical days.”\nA protester holds up a cutout of Edan Alexander’s face at a rally calling for the release of the hostages, at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, March 15, 2025. (Avshalom Sassoni/Flash90)\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement Sunday that the release of Alexander “must be the start of a single agreement that will return all 59 hostages.”\n“There is only one moral, proper and necessary agreement: the immediate return of all the hostages and the end of the war,” said the forum, which has long been calling for the government to agree to a deal that will return all the remaining hostages at once, rather than in phases.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Now is the time to bring about a breakthrough in negotiations. The responsibility lies with the Israeli government,” it added. “Nobody can be left behind.”\nTerror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 59 hostages, including 58 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023. They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF.\nHamas released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals — and the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives during a ceasefire between January and March. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. In exchange, Israel has freed some 2,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners, and Gazan terror suspects detained during the war.\nEight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014.\nThe body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt. Hadar Goldin, is still being held by Hamas, and is counted among the 59 hostages.\nAgencies contributed to this report."}

It stressed that Israel did not agree to a ceasefire or to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Alexander — only to provide a safe corridor to allow for his release.\nIn an earlier statement attributed to an “Israeli official,” Netanyahu’s office said that it was still prepared to accept the so-called “Witkoff proposal” through which Hamas agrees to release half of the hostages up front in exchange for a weekslong truce during which the sides agree to hold talks on the terms of a permanent end to the war.\nRepublican US presidential nominee Donald Trump poses for photos with family members of Edan Alexander, a hostage held by Hamas, after visiting the gravesite of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, October 7, 2024, in New York.

While the group has said it is prepared to forgo control of the Strip to an independent committee of Palestinian technocrats, it has held off on the demand to permanently disarm."}

Avichay Adraee warned those at the Ras Isa, Hodeidah, and Salif ports on the western coast to evacuate.\n“Due to the Houthi terror regime’s use of ports for its terror activities, we urge all those present at these ports to evacuate and stay away from them for your own safety until further notice,” he said.\nA report by Reuters, citing the Houthi interior ministry, claimed that Israel targeted Hodeidah port following the warning. Israeli military sources said no strikes had been carried out as of Sunday night. There were no reports in Houthi media of strikes either.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nOn Friday afternoon, the Houthis fired a ballistic missile that triggered sirens across central Israel. The IDF reported that the missile was successfully intercepted by air defenses.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz warned then that Israel would respond. “The Houthis continue to launch Iranian missiles at Israel. As we promised, we will respond, strongly in Yemen and anywhere else necessary,” he said in a statement.\nThe Friday attack came three days after the US announced that it had reached a ceasefire with the Yemeni terror group.\nHouthi officials made clear that the deal, in which they agreed to stop targeting US maritime activity in the Red Sea in exchange for an end to weeks of intense US airstrikes, did not include any agreement to stop firing at Israel or ships linked to the Jewish state.\nOn Wednesday, the IDF said a missile fired by the Houthis crashed outside Israeli territory. Earlier in the day, the IDF said it had downed a drone launched from Yemen.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe attacks came after Israel carried out two days of heavy sorties targeting infrastructure controlled by the Houthis in response to the missile that struck Ben Gurion Airport. Since Ben Gurion was hit, most foreign airlines have suspended flights to Israel.\nThe fiery reprisals destroyed the international airport in the capital Sanaa, and caused heavy damage to a port in Hodeida and several power stations and a cement factory, officials said.\nThe Houthis — whose slogan calls for “Death to America, Death to Israel, [and] a Curse on the Jews” — first began attacking Israel and maritime traffic in November 2023, a month after the October 7 Hamas massacre.\nThe Houthis held their fire when a ceasefire was reached between Israel and Hamas in January 2025. By that point, they had fired over 40 ballistic missiles and dozens of attack drones and cruise missiles at Israel, including one that killed a civilian and wounded several others in Tel Aviv in July, prompting Israel’s first strike in Yemen.\nSince March 18, when the IDF resumed its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis have launched some 29 ballistic missiles and at least 10 drones at Israel.\nThe sirens warning of missile attacks have sent hundreds of thousands of Israelis rushing to shelters at all hours of the day and night."}

The Houthi missile impacted in a grove of trees alongside an access road close to Terminal 3, several hundred yards from the airport control tower.\n“We are facing a situation where a missile that fell in Ben Gurion Airport could have just as easily fallen a little bit to the left or the right and could have hit an aircraft or a terminal, and that could have had a catastrophic effect,” Adv. Shirly Kazir, head of aviation & tourism practices at law firm FISCHER (FBC) told The Times of Israel. “So foreign airlines are obviously fearful, but even if airlines are willing to consider resuming flights to Israel when the situation calms down a bit, safety and the issue of pricing of insurance premiums come up once again.”\nKazir, who represents 20 foreign airlines operating in Europe and the US, said that the carriers want to resume flight services to Tel Aviv, but for that to happen, they will need more certainty and flexibility on the regulatory situation in Israel to ease costs and financial risk if they have to halt operations again because of the security situation.\nSign up for the Tech Israel Daily\nand never miss Israel's top tech stories\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“If it’s important for Israel to have the asset of foreign airlines flying to Israel, there are solutions the Transportation Ministry can advance that wouldn’t be too costly and that could make a shift in the airlines’ decision,” said Kazir, who has been representing foreign airlines in a proposal to make amendments to the 2012 Aviation Services Law, which protects consumer rights of passengers whose flights have been canceled.\nSmoke in the area of Ben Gurion Airport after a ballistic missile was fired at Israel from Yemen on May 4, 2025 (Screen grab from social media used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)\nAfter the rocket impact near the airport — which followed failed Israeli and American attempts to shoot it down — the Houthis boasted of their success and claimed that Ben Gurion Airport was “no longer safe for air travel.” The Yemen-based terror group threatened to “blockade” Israel’s airspace.\n“The fact that a missile managed to infiltrate and hit around Ben Gurion Airport caused a lot of concern,” said Eyal Doron, partner and head of the aviation department at law firm S. Horowitz & Co. “Had it fallen someplace else, far away from the airport for example, in an open area in the Negev desert, I’m not sure it would have caused such substantive material reaction by foreign airlines.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nInitially, many foreign carriers suspended flights to Israel for short periods of a day or two, while monitoring the situation daily. But by the end of last week, the list of airlines deciding to stay away for longer expanded. Some foreign airlines are postponing their return for weeks or months and, in some cases, indefinitely.\nIn response, the Transportation Ministry said that the government and aviation authorities are continuously working with foreign airlines to bring them back and restore flight services.\nAs of now, the Lufthansa Group — which includes German carrier Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, and Eurowings — has said it will not resume flights to Tel Aviv until May 19. Air India, which operates a direct route between Israel and India, has suspended flights until May 25. US carriers United and Delta airlines have halted flights until May 18 and May 20 respectively. Iberia will not resume flights until June 1, and British Airways not until June 15.\nAmong low-cost airlines, Wizz Air canceled flights until May 14, and Ryanair until May 21. UK carrier Virgin Atlantic at the end of April ceased direct flight services between London and Tel Aviv, after previously pausing the route amid the war.\nAccording to Kazir and Doron, recent flight suspensions by foreign airlines are based on similar considerations that have guided them throughout the war: safety considerations, risk management, insurance policy coverage and the refusal of flight crews to fly to Israel. They both cautioned that many foreign airlines halting their flight services will divert aircraft destined for Tel Aviv to other places, making it harder to resume service.\nAdv. Shirly Kazir, head of aviation & tourism practices at the FISCHER (FBC) law firm. (Courtesy of Ofir Abe)\n“If foreign airlines take their aircraft to a new route and a different destination, the chances of us getting them back for the summer period now are very low,” said Kazir. “Many clients I have, meaning foreign airlines, advise me in confidence that they are not resuming flights to Israel until the summer, which is horrific.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nMany of the airlines had only recently resumed services to Israel after they were canceled for much of the time since Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023, that started the war in Gaza. United had resumed flights in March, while Delta returned on April 1, and British Airways restarted its Israel flights on April 5.\n“Foreign airlines would like to fly to Israel, especially from a business point of view, as they’ve sold tickets [and] they don’t want August 2024 to happen again, faced with a situation where they have to deal with refunds and might again be sued by passengers,” said Doron.\n“Under the current situation, when nothing is clear, as we do not know what’s going to happen even next week, the State of Israel needs to convince foreign airlines that its airspace is safe, the airport is safe, and what happened a week ago was a very exceptional issue… No system is perfect, no system can give you 100% protection,” she said.\nWith foreign carriers absent, the supply of flights low and demand high, ticket prices will surge again, Doron and Kazir warned. Of the dozens of foreign airlines that dominated the local aviation market before the outbreak of war in Gaza, primarily Israeli carriers have maintained regular flight schedules amid the war. In recent days, Emirates, Abu Dhabi’s Etihad, and flydubai also continued flying despite the Houthi attack.\n“As foreign airlines cancel a flight, they already lose money because they can’t reallocate the airplane immediately, and then they have to refund passengers for the cost of the tickets or try to reroute them at a much higher cost — a monetary exposure they have faced throughout the war,” said Doron.\n“Many foreign airlines only resumed their Israel services in March, to end up in a situation where a couple of weeks later, flights are being canceled again, and they are again hit with ticket refunds and compensation. It’s not sustainable for a long time.”\nShe warned that “if the disruptions go on for a long time, my concern is that some airlines could decide that they are not coming back.”\nEarlier this year, Israeli lawmakers agreed to make legal changes to canceled flight compensation rights for air passengers to help ease the financial costs of disruptions to foreign carriers during the war period. The Knesset Economics Committee approved a proposal by foreign airlines to make amendments to the 2012 Aviation Services Law, which will restrict the terms and conditions of compensation paid by airlines to passengers in the event of flight cancellations during an emergency war period. The legal amendment was passed in a second and third reading in the Knesset in February.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDepending on the security situation, the Transportation Ministry, in consultation with the Economy Ministry, will be given the power and authority to temporarily suspend some of the compensation entitlements of consumers, such as limiting the obligation to provide accommodation in the event of a flight cancellation for up to two nights.\nAdv. Eyal Doron, partner and head of the aviation department at law firm S. Horowitz & Co. (Courtesy)\n“If foreign airlines [knew] that they have that flexibility from the Israeli regulation, it would give them more comfort to resume flight services, but for that to kick in, Israel needs to declare a special emergency situation,” said Kazir.\n“Foreign airlines want to know that they don’t sell flight tickets for ‘X’ amount, and then, in the case of cancellations, have to pay 10 times ‘X’.”\nDuring an emergency period, an airline that cancels all of its flights will also have options to offer passengers an alternative ticket, either from a different point of departure or to a different nearby destination such as Larnaca or Athens.\n“Airlines want to know that if they are not flying to Israel because of the security situation, they can bring passengers to nearby Cyprus or Greece instead of being exposed to massive costs that they would have to pay — to mostly Israeli airlines — to get passengers to their final destination in Tel Aviv,” said Kazir."}

But at 10 a.m., the connection was lost. A week later, she was informed of their deaths.\nAn internment ceremony was held on November 9 at a hotel near the Dead Sea where kibbutz residents were evacuated.\nAccording to a eulogy on the kibbutz website, Marina and Igor were both born in Zaporizhzhia, on the banks of the Dnieper River in Ukraine. They married in April 1988 and Katya was born a year later. When the USSR started falling apart, Igor and Marina decided to immigrate to Israel, inspired by the possibility of living in the secular and socialist environment of a kibbutz.\nLeaving their families and friends behind, the three immigrated to Israel in October 1994, moving into a caravan that was waiting for them at Kibbutz Be’eri. Marina worked at the printing press of the kibbutz, loved reading — especially detective novels — and loved looking after the plants at her home, her cats and stray cats. Igor started as a dishwasher at the kibbutz and then moved on to work at the printing house. He carefully tended the mango and citrus trees he planted in the yard of their home, the eulogy read.\nIn a statement shared by the kibbutz, Katya said that because she was an only child, Marina tended to be overly protective.\n“At every stage of my life she helped me, and I could trust her,” she said. “There is no one who did not receive her discreet and devoted care. Everyone knew she could be trusted.”\nHer father, Katya said, was an introvert, a quiet man who made good friends with his co-workers. He loved life in the kibbutz, but he also missed Russian culture. He and Katya used to watch Russian-dubbed cartoons together. He loved to work with his hands and repair things. Both her parents instilled in her a love for studies and a will to succeed, she said.\n“We were a small family, and now we are even a smaller one,” Katya said. “Now the kibbutz will be my family, and that of Kira and Dima.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.

With two friends he later went on to set up Firefly, a highly successful internet cloud management company.\nAfter sheltering from an initial rocket barrage from the Gaza Strip, Genis messaged his wife, Meital, to let her know he was fine. Together with Navon, he prepared to drive home.\nHowever, another rocket hit near their car and the two injured men were forced to again take cover in a public bomb shelter where there were already two women, Meital told Channel 12.\nHe continued sending messages to her and others, warning of the increasingly perilous situation as the rocket fire was replaced by the sounds of terrorists on foot shooting victims.\nThe last message he sent was “I love you” with a heart emoji, Meital recalled.\nThree weeks after the attack, one of the women who was hiding in the shelter, identified only as Alina, called Meital to explain what happened next, praising the pair of friends as “angels” who had saved her life.\nAlina said that as the four huddled in the shelter, they heard a terrorist approaching outside. She described the friends looking at each other in the eyes and then, without a word, together charging out to face the attacker, unarmed, in an effort to grab his gun.

His keenness to attend the party was an example of his “drive and passion for life” and his desire to “succeed and conquer the world,” she said.\n“And he did it,” Hadas added.\nIn a post to X (formerly Twitter), the Firefly company wrote, “Our Firefly family is heartbroken over the loss of our co-founder, Sefi Genis.

Shachaf, an active IDF reservist, had also been called up for reserve duty that day but was killed before seeing the message.\nShachaf was missing for a week following the Hamas attack, until his family was finally informed that his body had been found. Little is known about the circumstances surrounding his final moments.\nHe was buried in Tel Aviv on October 14. He is survived by his parents, Shlomit and Dov and his siblings Yaakov, Tal and Levona.\nBorn and raised in Kibbutz Alumim near the Gaza border, Shachaf was heavily involved in all kinds of sports throughout his life, according to a local eulogy. He played soccer and basketball, matkot (paddle ball) at the beach, practiced yoga and above all was a devoted runner, regularly racing around the kibbutz fields in the early morning hours before work. He also volunteered as a guide to run in partnership with those with impaired vision.\nIn 2009, Shachaf enlisted in the Orev unit of the Nahal Brigade’s elite reconnaissance unit, first training as a paramedic, according to an Orev eulogy. After his release, he remained an active reservist, always showing up when called for duty, most recently in August 2023, when he received a notation of excellence for his service.\nShachaf studied hydraulic engineering and worked overseeing the irrigation of crops. After living most of his life in Alumim, Shachaf moved to Kfar Aza a few years before his death but continued to work in the agriculture of Alumim. He was remembered as a doting uncle to his nieces and nephews, a caring friend who was always on hand with his pickup truck to help people move, and a devotee of physical fitness.\nOn what would have been his 34th birthday, his sister, Levona, wrote on Facebook that they went to celebrate the day “at the sea because we probably would have found you here in the middle of summer — sitting in the shade of the Otentik [sunshade] on a comfy beach chair, then getting up to play matkot and then running into the sea, jumping into the water.”\nLevona wrote, “This is your 34th birthday, but you will remain 33 forever… I hope everyone here can take something from Shachaf, the friend he was, the endless generosity, his unique hobbies, his full enjoyment of life, because as Shachaf himself said at some point in 2009 — ‘It doesn’t matter how many years there are in life, it matters how much life there is in the years.'”\nHis brother, Yaakov, wrote on Facebook marking a year since he was killed, noting all the times and places Shachaf’s absence was strongly felt.\n“In all of our apartment moves, my hand went to press your name in my phone and ask for help — who else could I request help from without feeling bad, who would come and advise us how to pack and unpack things and do everything with a smile with a huge heart,” he wrote. “Your absence is felt in long conversations with our parents, in every conversation with Mom and Dad I think, ‘Where is Shachaf when you need him?’ To talk to Mom for hours, to tell Dad good morning at the start of every day in the fields.”\nWhen things got busy with the kids, Yaakov wrote, “I would imagine you here, lightening the load, taking the kids anywhere they asked… Going to the desert without you, out on a trek doesn’t compute, the trips and the nature isn’t the same anymore.” When their sister Tal got married, “you weren’t at the chuppah, not on the dance floor… it was so easy to imagine you there in the middle, drinking a little, smoking a little but mostly smiling and happy, as you always were.”\n“But the place you are most missed is inside me.

His car was later found near Magen, but he was nowhere to be seen, and his loved ones believed he had been kidnapped.\nAfter close to 10 days, his family was informed that his body had been found.\nAs a member of the kibbutz’s local security team, he was posthumously recognized as a fallen soldier with the rank of sergeant major in the reserves.

Along the way they engaged in battles with terrorists on the side of the highway, killing many of them. Inside the kibbutz, they engaged in a fierce firefight, and even after being wounded, Lavi kept fighting until he was killed in battle.\nLavi, a Negevist, was in the middle of a squad commander’s course when he was slain in Kissufim alongside five others in the course: Staff Sgt.

After high school, he completed a year of national service with an agricultural group in Moshav Talmei Elazar in the north.\nIn December 2022, he enlisted in the IDF for his mandatory service, and though he had dreamed of serving in the Shayetet 13 elite Navy unit, he was ultimately placed in the Paratroopers Brigade. His family said that Lavi had been planning his army service for years and was dedicated to playing a meaningful role in the military.\nHe was undergoing a squad commander’s course at the time he was killed, and was also planning to later pursue an officer’s course, his loved ones said.\n“Lavi was a smiling and sarcastic boy, he stood out for his love of the country and his dedication to the people important to him and was prepared to go above and beyond for them,” according to an online eulogy written by his family. “Lavi loved the country, and from a young age, he was looking forward to enlisting and having a meaningful service in the IDF as a combat soldier.

That’s already a cliche,” he added. “To say what a hero you were, everyone already knows, to say you were such a good person, special and wonderful, everybody already knows.

That helped him have as much fun as possible, with things that did good for him and the family. He always wanted to take part in as many experiences as possible, to do the most good for those around him and to enjoy life.”\n“Dad taught me many things that I will take with me for the rest of my life,” he continued. “One of them is that we get one chance to live here, and you have to take advantage of the good things.

Cohen was never heard from again.\nHe was buried on October 10 at the Yarkon Cemetery in Petah Tikva.\nHe is survived by his mother Orna and sister Talya. He was predeceased by his father, Tsion.\nAfter 52 days of searching, his family was finally able to track down video footage of his final ever DJ set at the party, recovered from the phone of a partygoer who was also murdered that day.\nRoy Zinger, a festival and music producer who worked with Cohen, told Ynet that he was a “trance music creator who combined the modern and old school worlds. He had an incredible passion for it, his music was very joyous. Every time I listened to his music there would be a smile on my face.”\nHis friend Aviv Cohen told Haaretz that the two of them “sat for many hours in the studio together, jamming.

I never understood why he liked doing reserve duty so much, but his friends who came to the shiva [mourning period] told me how much he loved it and about the music he would bring.”\nOrna told Haaretz that his family wasn’t super enthusiastic about his chosen field, but supported him when he started studying music: “In recent years, what interested him were friends, music and the Florentin neighborhood in Tel Aviv where he lived. A lot of friends who play music came to the shiva.

He is thought to be the first police officer slain that day.\nThe Sderot police station became the site of fierce battles throughout the day as Hamas gunmen stormed the building and holed up inside. Ultimately, Israeli forces razed the building to kill those remaining inside and end the standoff.\nEliyahu was buried on October 9 in Ashdod. He is survived by his wife, Hodaya, their three daughters, Lia, Ofri and Noya, his parents, Racheli and Yitzhak, and his six siblings, Efrat, Rivka, Aviya, Elhanan, Hila and Batsheva.\nBorn and raised in a Haredi household, Eliyahu enlisted in the Israel Police in 2020 through the Shahar program designed as a framework for the ultra-Orthodox to complete their mandatory service. He later signed on to remain in the police force.\nIn the wake of Eliyahu’s death, his younger brother, Elhanan, decided also to join the police force in his memory.\n“There’s no way to describe my brother’s heroism… He went out first, fought, wanted to save as many lives as possible,” Elhanan told the Kan public broadcaster. “I’m continuing in his path… He was really a guide for me, in every way.”\nTheir father, Yitzhak, told Kan, “We were proud to be the parents of Eliyahu.

That’s how we were raised.”\nShe was in training at the police academy when he was killed, but said she had no doubts about continuing along that path after his death: “It was Eliyahu who sent my resume; Eliyahu knew what I wanted to do, which was to help Haredi women who couldn’t easily approach and speak out because it’s very difficult for crime victims to talk about difficult things… This is Eliyahu’s will: Eliyahu made sure that I joined the Israel Police – and he took care of me well, because they take good care of me – and for me, I’m here out of duty.”\nShe never forgets, she said, her husband’s bravery, and makes sure to always memorialize him: “Every day I talk about it, whether it’s with people, with my daughters, or even with myself.

Roy Elias, was killed fighting in south Gaza on December 23, and buried next to Gali.\nElias’s sister, Hadar, told Ynet that when her brother heard about Gali’s death on October 7, “The first thing Roy said to me was, ‘What will I do without Gali?’ He wrote me on Whatsapp: ‘I can’t do it anymore, I see him everywhere I go.’ He was really shattered by it, he didn’t stop visiting his grave.”\nGali’s aunt, Isabel Shakotai, wrote on Facebook a tribute to “our Gali, with your big, kind smiling eyes, which were like a window into your huge heart, which was full of good, only good. You left us a hole in our hearts, our hero, beloved boy. But don’t worry, we will fill that hole, with all the beautiful memories you left us, which nobody can take from us.”\nA eulogy read at his funeral on behalf of the community of Tzofar described him as “a young man of love. A boy and a teen with bright eyes who managed to instill confidence and pure joy of life in every child and adult he encountered. Until his last day, Gali chose to do and to act on behalf of others. He had the ability to make people happy, to make them laugh, and to extend a sensitive and warm hand to every friend who needed him.”\nGali, the eulogy read, was “a child of the desert who loved the desert that his yard overlooked. At every opportunity and at every gathering with friends he would choose to go outside, sometimes on his ATV which would make noise in the desert and sometimes with friends, and they would load up with wine and their coffee maker and sit and love — they loved this life with the endless spaces where they grew up.”\nGali’s cousin, Aviv, wrote on Facebook about “Gali of the Arava and of nature, who loved animals and had encyclopedic knowledge, Gali who loved to fool around, who tested every boundary, who created from nothing — no matter where I look in Rubi and Osher’s yard I see something that Gali made or found and fixed up.”\nAviv wrote, “I would ask all the time for him to take me around on the ATV and introduce me to cool and secret places in the Arava, and Gali, who was dead tired, who had just come back from the army or from national service — and who has the strength to entertain a cousin asking for a favor? But you would say yes, because that was the size of your heart. You made everyone feel special and important to you.”\nAs the memorials and tributes poured in, Aviv wrote, “I thought to myself how very alive you were, how can it be that a person like this died just like that? You empowered this world with your emotion and your energy, your endless curiosity which gave you a sum of experiences that would normally take a lifetime — at least that’s what I want to tell myself.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

Nathanel Young, 20, a lone soldier from the United Kingdom serving in the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, was killed in action on October 7 at the Yiftah IDF outpost next to Zikim.\nHe is survived by his parents, Chantal and Nicky, and his older siblings Gaby, Eliot, Daniel and Miriam.\nYoung emigrated to Israel two years ago to join the Israeli Defense Forces. The youngest of five siblings – three of whom live in Israel – he was a former student at JFS, a Jewish school in Kenton, north London.\nHis sister Gaby told LBC radio that in his actions on October 7, “We understood from a few people that he saved lives, that he saved a kibbutz from being infiltrated by terrorists. That is a heroic action.”\nHis brother, Eliot, told Sky News, “Nathanel always had strong Jewish pride. From a young age he has always wanted to play an important role in defending his country — it’s something he talked about a lot.”\nEliot added that “Nathanel was also a bubbly guy who my two little daughters loved playing with and were always so excited to visit. When Nathanel could have taken his days off to sleep and re-energize, he instead found out where we were, which wasn’t always so close to him, and came to join us.”\nAt his funeral at Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem on October 9, Eliot eulogized his younger brother: “Nat said, from the age of 10 or 11, that he wanted to serve in the IDF and protect Israel. He had such a deep connection to the country.”\nHis sister Gaby also paid tribute to him: “He arrived and managed to continue to follow his passions by dog-sitting, working out on the beach, getting a job as a DJ at one of Tel Aviv’s most famous clubs, and joining the IDF. He found true happiness in Israel and it was infectious. His selfless kindness was so rare, and I aspire to be as kind as him.”\nIn the middle of the funeral, blaring rocket sirens interrupted the service, as the Iron Dome air defense system could be heard intercepting rockets from on high. The funeral continued after the sirens ceased.\nHundreds turned out to pay their respects to Young, most of whom did not know him personally, including Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion.\nCol. Yoav Mordechai, former commander of the Jerusalem Brigade, addressed the mourning Young family at the funeral: “Be proud of Netanel, he was a hero. We, the Golani Brigade, are your family, now and forever. You will forever be a part of the Golani Brigade.”\nShortly after the one-week mourning period, Young’s parents, Chantel and Nicky, followed in their children’s footsteps and moved to Israel.\n“We need to be in the place where our son is, in the country that he fought for,” they said in a statement. “Nathanel realized his dream to protect the State of Israel with bravery and determination. We are all so proud of him and miss him so.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

They were all slain inside the shelter along with dozens of others when Hamas terrorists threw grenades inside and opened fire on the huddled partygoers.\nTwo brothers in the family headed down to the Supernova site to try and find their loved ones that Saturday morning, encountering roadblocks, cops and IDF troops who tried to convince them to turn around. They searched for hours and hours but kept coming up empty handed.\nFor a week, the family couldn’t find any trace of the three despite constant searching. A week after the massacre, Shenhav’s body was identified, and a day later Liel and Shoham were also confirmed killed.\nShoham was buried in Herzliya on October 15, and Shenhav was buried next to her a day later, on October 16. Liel was buried in Beit Shemesh on October 16.\nThe sisters are survived by their parents, Rachel and Neria Yehiel, and their seven older siblings, Dudu, Avishag, Dvir, Sapir, Ohad, Elad and Hadas.\nLiel is survived by his parents, Dudu and Nardit, and his younger siblings Adir, 14, Itay, 9 and Shaylee, 7.\nBorn and raised in the Kiryat Yovel neighborhood of Jerusalem, Liel focused his high school studies on cyber communications, and was slated to soon enlist in the IDF, aiming for a spot in the prestigious 8200 intelligence unit.\n“He really loved computers, he was always on the computer,” his father, Dudu, told a local Jerusalem news site. “He was supposed to join 8200 and all his future was ahead of him. He had a big future, he was an excellent student. A smart kid, kind and quiet.”\nDudu said Liel’s younger siblings “loved him so much. He was a true firstborn, he would take care of them, talk to them, advise them. He was a role model for them, he was modest, not one who partied much, even though he was murdered at a festival.” His father said, “I miss his smile, his laughter, the nonsense he loved. I think about him all the time, about his positive spirit and his joy for life.”\nEleven months after he was killed, Liel’s mother, Nardit, wrote on Facebook to “my angel in heaven.”\n“It’s already a year without you, a year of longing and endless pain, a year that your voice has been silent,” she wrote. “You left an empty space and a hole in my heart in the shape of you, my beautiful angel… Liel, my heart breaks anew every day. I miss you so much.”\nShoham and Shenhav were very close to each other and the rest of the family, were huge fans of the Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team and loved to go out partying together, their loved ones said.\nAvishag, their older sister, told Israel Hayom that Shoham and Shenhav lived every moment of their short lives to the fullest.\n“Shoham was very serious on the one hand, but also loved to laugh, to live big and to take life by storm. She dreamed big. She was a personal trainer and a nutritionist, it was important to her to instill in others a healthy lifestyle. She dedicated her life to exercise and even learned boxing,” said Avishag.\n“She was always working on herself, she took big trips to faraway places. During our happiest moments, during holidays and vacations, she was the family photographer, she captured every moment,” she added.\nShenhav, the youngest of the nine siblings, was “our baby, who arrived after four brothers and four sisters,” said Avishag.\n“She saw day-to-day life as boring and she had big dreams,” she said. “She wanted to explore the world, to fly to Australia for a long period. She was an incredible baker, for every birthday she would make my daughter a gorgeous cake. She also planned to open a bakery.”\nThe two sisters, she said, “were the centers of our lives, they were so close to each other from childhood until the moment they were murdered. They were opposites who completed each other, the sun and the moon — each of them lit up the world in their own way.”\nHadar Cohen, a niece to Shoham and Shenhav, wrote on Instagram how hard it was to come to terms with the fact that “the aunts who were always there for me, and always hung out with me, and took care of me, and made me laugh, and were my best friends — but so much more — are no longer here.”\n“My aunts who were the most beautiful, kindest, successful and funny are not around anymore,” she added. “Those who raised me and also sort of grew up with me, Shenhav who tried unsuccessfully to teach me Justin Bieber songs, and Shoham who would drive even an hour so I could braid her hair before she’d go to a festival.”\n“My aunts who taught me what unconditional love was, who always took care of me and wanted the best for me — they’re not coming back and I didn’t even get to say goodbye,” she added.\n“We miss Shoham and Shenhav and Liel all the time, at every holiday, at every event,” their brother and uncle, Ohad, told i24 news in August. “Their loss is strongly felt in every moment of our lives. Our family will never return to what it was.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

Martin Kyzmickas, 46, a company commander in the National Enforcement Unit, from Sderot, was killed on October 7 while battling Hamas terrorists at the Sderot Police Station.\nAccording to Israel Hayom, Martin had just completed an overnight shift and returned home when the attack began. He heard the sounds of gunfire and headed back toward the police station where he was killed in the battle.\nThe police station was the site of heavy battles as Hamas terrorists stormed the building and holed up inside. Ultimately more than two dozen officers were killed, and the next day security forces demolished the building, killing the remaining terrorists inside.\nDeputy Commissioner Amir Cohen told Israel Hayom that just minutes before he was shot dead, Martin turned to him and said: “Commander, this is what I’ve been waiting for, to battle terrorists.”\nMartin was killed just a few weeks before what would have been his 47th birthday.\nHe was buried in Tel Aviv on October 10. He is survived by his wife, Svetlana, their three children, Alisa, Mark and Tom, as well as his mother, Irena and a sister.\nBorn in Vilnius, Lithuania, Martin moved to Israel in 1995 at age 18. He joined the Israel Police in 2005 and remained in the force until his death more than 18 years later.\nCommander Eyal Raon, the head of Martin’s division in the police, said that when he couldn’t reach him that morning, “the first thing we said was of course, he’s gone out to fight. It’s in his DNA… he was a hero.”\nDanny Shtein, who served in the IDF with Martin, wrote on Facebook that he was the “most Rambo soldier I know. He raised his hand to volunteer for everything, from the most junior to most insane. A quiet soldier. Didn’t complain, not a conversationalist. To be with him in battle or in training and to see him on autopilot with his MAG rifle was incredible.”\n“Martin was a warrior in every inch of his being. He was tough and quiet. Didn’t talk, didn’t argue or get into fights,” Shtein added. “Everybody loved him. Everybody wanted to be Martin.”\nIn a video put out by the Israel Police in his memory, his wife, Svetlana, said he headed back out to fight that day “because that was his choice, because he’s a viking.” Back when they met, she said, he was a fighter, “he was a warrior in his blood.”\nSvetlana said when he headed back out early that morning, “I just heard the door close behind him. He didn’t say goodbye. We didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.”\nAt his funeral, she noted that her husband was not a particularly smiley man, “but when he smiled, he smiled. He smiled from all his heart.” In each of their three children, she said, “there is half of him. So I have a Martin and a half.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

Even so, they were calm at first, taking selfies in the safe room that they even uploaded to Facebook with the caption, “Bunker Time.”\nWhen the terrorists entered the shelter, they shot and killed two of the students. They then threw two grenades into the space. Joshi threw one of the grenades away, but the other exploded, injuring several people in the room.\nAt that point, some of the Thai workers and Nepali students fled to other hiding places, while Joshi and several others tried to rescue those who were wounded.\nHe also sent several messages to his cousin in English, writing, “If something happens to me you have to take care of my family. Be strong and always see the future.”\nAnother terrorist then ordered Joshi and three Thai workers to walk out the door. One Nepali who was hiding heard one of the Thai workers saying, “Thailand, Thailand.”\nThey also heard the terrorist shouting, “Run, run.”\nIt was the last time that anyone saw Bipin alive.\nAs of November 11, the Nepali government still hadn’t confirmed whether Bipin is alive.

Kosher, the most recognizable kosher certifier in the United States.\nThe callers were all anxious about the potential implications of the policy change on the kosher status of milk. Since 1954, most kosher-keeping American Jews have relied on an influential rabbi’s determination that government oversight of milk production is sufficient to render commercially produced milk kosher.\nThe rabbi, Moshe Feinstein, was dealing with an age-old problem of Jewish law when he made his ruling.\nAccording to halacha, or traditional Jewish law, milk is only kosher if it comes from a kosher animal. One way to ensure that is the case is to consume only milk produced in a facility where Jews oversee every step of the process — relatively easy to accomplish in the pre-modern world, but less practical in the contemporary United States.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nFeinstein — considered one of the most important Jewish legal authorities of the 20th century — addressed the challenge by ruling that government regulations could effectively take the place of some aspects of Jewish supervision. Because the US government both requires that only cow’s milk be called milk, and because inspectors are regularly dispatched to milk production facilities to ensure that all legal requirements are upheld, Jews could assume that commercial milk does not contain milk from non-kosher animals, Feinstein concluded.\nHis opinion was so decisive and pivotal that the Orthodox Union cites it on its landing page for queries about milk. But what happens if the federal government overhauls or abandons its oversight of milk?\nNothing, at least for now. That’s what Gordimer and his team have concluded after seeking to understand just what has changed at the FDA.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“This development has no impact whatsoever on the kosher status of ‘chalav stam’ [regular commercial milk] that Rabbi Feinstein permitted in the US, as the primary oversight of farms and dairy factories is performed by state governments; the FDA is a mere secondary body for this purpose,” he said by email.\nWhat’s more, Gordimer said, the testing that Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended is meant only to detect certain contaminants and prohibited additives. Physical inspections, which he said are continuing uninterrupted, are different, and key to Feinstein’s ruling.\n“There has been no change in inspections, which are ongoing,” Gordimer said.\nIllustrative: US President Donald Trump speaks to the press after signing an executive order, alongside US Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (L) and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick (R), at the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, on February 25, 2025. (Jim Watson/AFP)\nPlus, the law prohibiting anything other than cow’s milk from being sold as “milk” remains on the books.\nStill, the reports about changes have prompted concerns from kosher consumers. “Are we seeing the first step in the end of chalav stam…” one person asked in the Facebook group Great Kosher Restaurant Foodies.\nSome Jews have rejected Feinstein’s opinion and instead limited their consumption to cholov yisroel milk, which is overseen by Jews throughout the production process. But it tends to be harder to find and more expensive.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA kosher-keeping critic of US President Donald Trump tweeted about the regulatory changes, “If I have to go cholov yisroel because of Tronald Dump my head might explode.”\nEven as OU Kosher — as well as health experts — says the current changes are no cause for concern, the scaling back of milk testing offers an early sign that kosher supervisors will need to pay attention to sweeping changes underway under the Trump administration. Kennedy has broad and unorthodox views on a number of topics and has promised to shake up everything from fluoridation in water to vaccines to food additives.\nThis week, he announced plans to ban synthetic food dyes. Mounting concerns about synthetic dyes, which are widely used in commercial food production, have caused producers to turn to natural alternatives — such as cochineal extract, a derivative from parasitic bugs that is a powerful substitute for red dyes.\nWorkers pour harvested female insects known as Dactylopius coccus onto a sifter to make cochineal dye, or carmine, east of Mexico City, August 24, 2023. (AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo)\nCochineal extract, called carmine, is not kosher, meaning that kosher supervisors may need to retract certification of some items if their producers opt to replace synthetic reds with it. That happened with some forms of Tums, the heartburn relief medication, in recent years, according to a 2021 alert from the Chicago Rabbinical Council, which like the OU certifies products and offers guidance to kosher consumers.\nBut it’s also possible that producers will keep kosher-keeping customers in mind as they adjust to Kennedy’s decrees. Paulaur, which produces sprinkles and other food toppings, recently dropped its use of Red 3, a synthetic dye, the Wall Street Journal reported last month — but turned to beetroot juice and purple sweet potatoes as coloring agents so it could continue to sell kosher products."}

Healy wrote that the Times seeks to avoid Nazi references in the essays it publishes, but felt David’s piece “is not equating Trump with Hitler. It is about seeing someone for who they really are and not losing sight of that.”\nDavid joined other critics of Maher’s conciliatory description of his Trump meeting. “Bill is just the latest in a whole series of people who get had by the personal charm, if you will, of some really bad people,” said Democratic strategist James Carville on his “Politics War Room” podcast.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn a segment on “Real Time,” Washington Post global security analyst Josh Rogin told Maher he was a “prop” in Trump’s “PR stunt.”\nIn the David piece, the narrator banters amiably with Hitler, who laughs at his jokes. “I realized I’d never seen him laugh before,” he writes. “Suddenly he seemed so human.”\nMaher said something similar about Trump in his monologue: “Just for starters, he laughs! I’ve never seen him laugh in public. But he does, including at himself. And it’s not fake.”\nIn his editor’s note, Healy writes that “David, in a provocation of his own, is arguing that during a single dinner or a private meeting, anyone can be human, and it means nothing in the end about what they’re capable of.”\nA history of satirical Holocaust references\nDavid, who skewered conservative policies on his long-running HBO show, has often used Nazi references in his satire. As a standup comedian, he would goad audiences by saying “The one thing about Hitler that I admire…” before suggesting that the dictator had no patience for stage magicians.\nHe and Jerry Seinfeld created the “Soup Nazi” character on “Seinfeld,” and “Curb” featured a memorable clash between a Holocaust survivor and a contestant on the reality show “Survivor” who too considered himself a victim.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSuch jokes have divided audiences, and even individual critics. In an essay criticizing David for a Holocaust joke he told while hosting “Saturday Night Live” in 2017, Jeremy Dauber praised the “Survivor” episode on “Curb.”\n“In that ‘Curb’ episode,” writes Dauber, a professor of Jewish literature at Columbia University, “David is searchingly moral, flaying a kind of ethical vacuity and historical relativism about the Holocaust.”\nDavid’s piece is also reminiscent of a 2003 skit by the Jewish comedian Jon Stewart, who imagines Hitler being interviewed by the late Larry King, the ingratiating CNN talk show host.\nIn his Max monologue, Maher, who positions himself as a centrist truth-teller between political extremes, anticipates the blowback he was sure to receive as a result of his dinner with a deeply polarizing president. “You can hate me for it, but I’m not a liar. Trump was gracious and measured, and why he isn’t that in other settings, I don’t know,” he said."}

He also took an internship with Sen. Carl Levin, a Jewish Michigan Democrat, during which a visit to the Library of Congress first planted the idea of History by Mail.\nWhile there, he encountered a handwritten letter from Abraham Lincoln, and said the experience made him realize that the best way to learn about history was through primary source documents. He was also inspired by the stories of his grandfathers, who both served in World War II.\nPart of the “unconscious” impetus behind History By Mail, Siegel said, was the way Jewish learning centered on the study of primary sources, such as the Torah and Talmud.\n“We are used to, in a Jewish context, learning from primary sources, but out there in the world, people don’t typically learn that way, and so it’s sort of bringing a Jewish style of learning to the general public,” said Siegel.\nHe began sending replicas of historical documents to friends and family, and from there he launched his business in 2019.\nSiegel said his great-great-grandfather immigrated to America in 1881 and started a watchmaking business and jewelry store and passed down his entrepreneurial spirit.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“There’s something in the Jewish culture or DNA that is very much about entrepreneurship,” said Siegel.\nIn his “Shark Tank” pitch, Siegel presented each judge — known in the show’s parlance as a Shark — with an edition of History By Mail.\nTwo Jewish Sharks took a pass on Siegel’s pitch: Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks minority owner whose edition focused on the history of basketball, and Lori Greiner, the TV personality who got a version about Annie Oakley.\nDallas Mavericks team owner Mark Cuban walks to his seat during the first half of an NBA basketball game against the Houston Rockets in Dallas, November 28, 2023.

As he prepared for his episode, Siegel said he successfully pushed back on the studio when they initially scheduled his taping for Shabbat.\nSiegel and Lubetzky finalized their business deal this year on the Jewish holiday of Tu Bishvat, and Siegel said he put out KIND Bars for his guests as an homage to his new business partner.\n“He made his fortune on fruits and nuts, and this is the holiday of fruits and nuts, and it just like happened to be that I came to the terms of the deal with him on that day, which was amazing,” said Siegel."}

But we also recognize that America won’t make that decision as to how Israel will approach Judea and Samaria — it will be a decision made in Israel by the Israelis.”\nIn the Channel 13 interview, Huckabee also spoke about the ongoing nuclear talks between the US and Iran, and was asked whether Washington would support Israel carrying out military action against Iran if such a deal is signed, should the Jewish state still deem it to be a threat.\nUS Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee holds a press conference at the US Embassy in Jerusalem, May 9, 2025.

If the Houthis want to continue doing things to Israel and they hurt an American, then it becomes our business.”\nAsked to clarify whether he meant that the US would only intervene to fight the rebel group if a US citizen was hurt by a Houthi missile, the ambassador said: “It’s a matter of what becomes our immediate business.”\nHis remarks echoed those made by Trump, who, when asked about the Houthis pledging to continue attacking Israel notwithstanding their agreement with the US, responded: “I’ll discuss that if something happens.”\nHuckabee noted that “the United States isn’t required to get permission from Israel to make some type of arrangement that would get the Houthis from firing on our ships.”\nSmoke in the area of Ben Gurion Airport after a ballistic missile was fired at Israel from Yemen on May 4, 2025 (Screen grab from social media used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)\nAsked about the many reports that Netanyahu was caught off guard by the announcement of the US-Houthi deal, the former Arkansas governor told Kan: “I don’t know what he knew and when he knew it.

Israeli officials were reportedly surprised by the deal, and Netanyahu vowed to “defend ourselves alone.”\nTrump has also reportedly pressured Israel to let aid into Gaza, following a two-month stoppage.\nOn Thursday, Reuters reported that Trump was no longer demanding that Saudi Arabia recognize Israel as part of a broader pact with the United States — leaving a deal that would have been Netanyahu’s holy grail by the wayside.\nFinally, on Friday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth scrapped his planned Israel trip to instead accompany Trump on his Middle East sojourn.\nCritics and supporters of Netanyahu and Trump alike are noticing. On Thursday, the front page of Yediot Aharonot, an Israeli daily seen as critical of Netanyahu, blared that Trump had a “policy of surprises” when it came to Israel. Below it was a political cartoon showing Trump cooking up a soup for Netanyahu, who sits, with a shocked expression, at a restaurant table behind the president.\n“The Americans are advancing a deal with the Saudis, advancing a deal with Iran, advancing a new regional outline… but the Americans don’t take Netanyahu or Israel into account,” tweeted Yair Golan, head of The Democrats left-wing party. “President Trump, whom Netanyahu saw as a strategic partner for his survival, understands today that Netanyahu isn’t an asset but a liability.”\nNetanyahu’s allies have also expressed concerns — or even taken a threatening tone. Nissim Vaturi, a lawmaker in Netanyahu’s Likud Party, tweeted that Trump “is an important friend of Israel. He should remember that he was elected to the presidency riding on the wings of support for Israel.” He later deleted the tweet.\nOther voices are framing Trump’s actions as a bane not just for Netanyahu but for Israel. Avraham Ben-Tzvi, a scholar of US-Israel relations and columnist for the right-leaning daily Israel Hayom, pointed to a “bitterness” toward Israel in Washington.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The main expression of this bitterness is the sidelining of Israel, and an American effort to advance along routes that bypass Jerusalem,” he wrote Wednesday, asking “whether a new Middle East order is indeed forming before our eyes, without Israel as an official partner.”\nIn the United States, Halie Soifer, head of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, wrote Friday that the trend shows what she and other critics of Trump have long warned: “Despite the false perception that Trump is an ally of Israel, it has become increasingly clear that Trump’s ‘America First’ foreign policy does not prioritize Israel.”\nThe apparent shift in Trump’s approach may be more consistent than it seems, according to Michael Koplow, chief policy officer of the Israel Policy Forum. Using an analogy from “The Godfather,” Koplow wrote that Trump may be telling Israel, essentially, that if it wants to keep fighting in Gaza, it can. But in that case, Trump will distance himself from Israel and does not want to be involved in its plans.\n“Trump will give Israel all of the support it wants, provided that it doesn’t cost too much and doesn’t require tradeoffs elsewhere,” wrote Koplow. “Trump is not going to Israel because he doesn’t see any upside to going there and does not want to be dragged into Netanyahu’s Gaza mess.”\nThe seemingly fading prospects of Saudi-Israeli normalization are especially notable because it appeared to be a rare area of consensus: Trump, Biden, Netanyahu and centrist Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid had all voiced support for an Israel-Saudi Arabia agreement.\nPeople walk past an electronic billboard that shows US President Donald Trump, left, shaking hands with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with the pro-normalization message ‘We are ready,’ in Tel Aviv, February 3, 2025. (AP Photo/ Ariel Schalit)\nThomas Friedman, The New York Times columnist and frequent Trump and Netanyahu critic who reported on prospects for an Israel-Saudi deal under Biden prior to Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack, placed the blame on Netanyahu — and congratulated Trump. The title of his column Friday, written as a letter to Trump, was “This Israeli Government Is Not Our Ally.”\n“Netanyahu put his personal interests ahead of Israel’s and America’s,” Friedman wrote, dooming an Israeli-Saudi accord that would have “opened the whole Muslim world to Israeli tourists, investors and innovators, eased tensions between Jews and Muslims the world over and consolidated US advantages in the Middle East.”\nHe continued: “After Netanyahu’s spinning everyone for two years, both the Americans and Saudis have reportedly decided to give up on Israel’s involvement in the deal — a true loss for both Israelis and the Jewish people.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nTrump’s actions have sparked some pushback on Capitol Hill. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Israel supporter and Trump ally, has said he will only support a deal with Iran that dismantles its nuclear program, and has continued to call for normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel.\nA bipartisan group of lawmakers wrote Trump a letter “to express our serious concern over the agreement reached on May 6 with the Iranian-backed Houthi forces in Yemen, which halts US strikes against Houthi targets without addressing the threat to Israel.”\nBut even within Trump’s own party, support for Israel is showing signs of slipping. A recent poll by the Arab American Institute found that nearly half of Republican respondents agree that Trump should place greater pressure on Israel to end its occupation and allow a Palestinian state.\nMany of Trump’s plans have yet to be finalized. But the Israeli-American writer Sarah Tuttle-Singer of The Times of Israel posted to Facebook that whatever happens in the end, Trump has engaged in “a dizzying turn of whiplash diplomacy” to Israel’s detriment.\n“Trump courts deals with our enemies,” she wrote. “He negotiates with Iran, signs understandings with the Houthis and redraws lines in the region with Israel conspicuously left out of the room.”"}

(Evan Vucci/AP)\nIsrael-Saudi normalization seemed just around the corner before the Hamas onslaught of October 7, 2023, that started the war in Gaza. Two Israeli ministers made unprecedented state visits to the desert kingdom in the weeks before the shock assault that sparked the war in Gaza. But the prospect of normalization faded as anti-Israel sentiment reached new heights in the Muslim world amid the war.\nDuring his first term, Trump brokered the Abraham Accords normalization agreements between Israel, the UAE, Morocco, Sudan and Bahrain, partly in exchange for Israel backing away from a plan to annex the West Bank, the seat of the Palestinian Authority.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTrump in his first term also proposed a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that would have seen a truncated Palestinian state established in parts of the West Bank, Gaza and the Negev Desert. The plan was rejected outright by both the PA and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s pro-settler coalition partners.\nIsrael has long accused the PA of inciting violence against Jews in its school system and through stipends paid to families of Palestinian terrorists detained in Israeli prisons. Abbas ordered an end to the so-called play-to-play system in February, less than a month after Trump took office for the second time.\nFrom left, Bahrain Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, then-US president Donald Trump, and United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, sit during the Abraham Accords signing ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House, in Washington, September 15, 2020. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\nThe meeting in Riyadh on Tuesday comes as Trump has reportedly expressed frustration over the failure to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, which has been devastated over 19 months of war. The PA had previously threatened to cut ties with Trump over a plan he announced in February to take over Gaza, oust its residents and rebuild the devastated Strip as a coastal resort.\nA rival Egyptian plan for postwar Gaza would have ultimately handed the Strip over to the PA, but Netanyahu has rejected any role for the unpopular body in Gaza’s postwar governance.\nSeparately, Israel has maintained troop presence and carried out military strikes in southern Lebanon following the ceasefire with Hezbollah in November, and ib the Syrian side of the Golan Heights following Sharaa’s ouster in December of Syria’s Iran-backed president Bashar al-Assad. Both Lebanese President Aoun and Syria’s Sharaa have demanded that Israel withdraw from their respective countries."}

(AP/Evan Vucci)\nIsrael has set Trump’s trip as the deadline for a ceasefire deal with Hamas before launching a planned major offensive in Gaza.\nTrump has, however, taken an increasingly hands-off approach, although the United States says it is working with Israel on a US-led plan to get aid into the blockaded enclave, which hasn’t received aid in over two months, since a ceasefire-hostage deal collapsed. Israel and the US say Hamas diverts the aid and uses it to maintain control over the Strip.\nThe war in Gaza began when Hamas-led terrorists invaded southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza, 58 of whom remain captive in the enclave. The body of an additional IDF soldier who was kidnapped a decade ago is also being held by Hamas.\nDue to the ongoing war, efforts to get Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel, which Trump also sought during his first term, are likely to stay on the burner, as Riyadh says it first needs to see progress toward a Palestinian state, which has been a nonstarter for Jerusalem.\nTrump told Time magazine last month that Saudi Arabia will join the Abraham Accords— the series of normalization agreements that his previous administration brokered between Israel and several Arab states. “That will happen,” he said.\nReuters reported this week, however, that the US is no longer demanding Saudi Arabia normalize ties with Israel as a condition for progress on civil nuclear cooperation talks.\nEarlier this month, the US gave initial approval to sell $3.5 billion worth of air-to-air missiles for Saudi Arabia’s fighter jets, the latest proposed arms deal for the region ahead of Trump’s trip.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe sale will likely be one of several heralded by Trump on his visit to the kingdom, AP reported, noting that Saudi Arabia has already said it wants to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years.\nPeople walk past an electronic billboard that shows US President Donald Trump, left, shaking hands with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with the pro-normalization message ‘We are ready,’ in Tel Aviv, February 3, 2025.

I have no intention of doing it.”\nShem Tov said he managed to stay on his captors’ good side by amusing them and performing menial tasks. One night in captivity, however, when the IDF was operating nearby, he decided to carry out a plan to kill his captors and escape. “There was no other way,” he said.\nWhen all his captors were asleep, Shem Tov said, he quietly took hold of one of their weapons.

The terrorists opened fire, according to Shem Tov. He recalled one coming up to him, grabbing him by the shirt and tossing him to the ground before beginning to beat him. He could also see terrorists remove Itay and Maya from the car, both with bullet wounds in their legs. Maya’s leg was “just dangling in the air,” said Shem Tov.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe and the two siblings were loaded onto a pickup truck and driven to a small storage unit in Gaza, Shem Tov said, recalling the shouts of “Allahu Akbar” he could hear from outside. In the storage unit, Shem Tov was ordered to climb down into a hole in the ground. Once underground, he was met by an armed terrorist and was made to lie on the floor.\nOri Danino (Courtesy)\nShem Tov said his first instinct was to make nice with the terrorist. “I ask him, ‘What’s your name?’ And he tells me his name, and then I tell him my name,” recalled Shem Tov, adding that the terrorist had not asked.\n“I say to him, ‘I’m Omer,’ and then he says to me, ‘Do you know Eden Ben-Zaken?'” Shem Tov said, referring to the Israeli pop singer.\n“I told him I do, and he says: ‘Sing me a song.’ So I sing Queen of Roses,” Shem Tov chuckled, referring to Ben Zaken’s 2015 hit. “Just the chorus… he even continued after me.”\nFrom there, Shem Tov was taken to his first cell. He said the first thing he thought of there was Gilad Shalit, an IDF soldier whom Hamas kidnapped in 2006 and released five years later in exchange for over 1,000 Palestinian terrorists, many of serving life terms for murder — including Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, who masterminded the October 7 onslaught. Shem Tov said he thought at this point that he, too, would remain in Gaza for five years.\nIsraelis visit the site of the October 7, 2023, Reim-area Nova music festival massacre, on October 6, 2024. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nForty minutes later, terrorists brought in a heavily bloodied Itay Regev, said Shem Tov, adding: “I said, thank God, I have Itay now.” After a few minutes, Shem Tov said, the terrorists also brought in Itay’s sister Maya, but removed her two minutes later to an adjacent room.\nADVERTISEMENT\n‘We’ll be back in a week’\nShem Tov recalled asking the captor who stayed in his room how many Palestinian prisoners he would be worth in an exchange. The captor said fifty. The answer gave Shem Tov hope, he said.\n“I look at Itay and I say to him, ‘Oh that’s great, it’s all good,'” said Shem Tov. “‘Gilad Shalit was like a thousand, we’ll be back in a week, it’s all good.'”\nOne night, Shem Tov recalled, he and Itay were awakened by the whistle of a bomb. Moments later, there was a massive boom, and the window of their cell shattered, Shem Tov said. He and Itay clutched onto each other’s hands, Shem Tov. “I think we even fell asleep like that,” he added.\nThree days after the air raid, Shem Tov and Itay were moved to a new apartment. But their new quarters were also rattled by air raids, Shem Tov said, recalling one night when he was sure the building would collapse and kill him. When the building stopped shaking, a terrorist covered in dust came in and informed them that ten buildings were felled in the raid, Shem Tov said.\nThe captor in that apartment had a television in the next room, which played Al Jazeera. Shem Tov said one night, the door of his room was left slightly ajar and he was able to watch a speech by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the Gaza war.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seen walking in the Knesset in Jerusalem on November 27, 2023. (Chaim Goldberg/FLASH90)\nThe premier’s message, Shem Tov said, was that “the main goal is to destroy Hamas.”\n“He didn’t say, ‘we’ll bring them back home.’ He didn’t say, ‘there’s a deal.’ He didn’t say anything like that,” said Shem Tov. “When it was over, I went back to Itay, and he said, ‘What, what did he say?’ he recounted. “And I told him, ‘Everything’s fine, he said they’ll bring us back home.'”\n“And then I started thinking about… my parents, my family,” said Shem Tov. “The suffering they are going through now.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nShem Tov would remain alone in captivity after the November 2023 ceasefire, which saw Hamas release 105 women and children in exchange for 240 Palestinians detained in Israel. Itay Regev, who was 18 at the time, was released days after his sister, leaving Shem Tov alone.\n“Suddenly, there was silence in the apartment,” said Shem Tov. “And then began… the fears, the feeling of loneliness. I felt that I was going insane.”\nReleased Gaza hostage Itay Regev is embraced by his mother at the Hatzerim airbase, November 30, 2023. (IDF Spokesperson’s Unit)\n‘Could see the bones of my shoulders and ribs’\nWhen the fighting resumed after the first hostage deal, Shem Tov was moved a third time. “We walk underground for something like 50 minutes, and we reach a kind of cell, with bars. They open the cell, put me inside and close it,” said Shem Tov. “I immediately had an asthma attack. The moment I got there I wasn’t able to breathe.”\nOne of his captors there was a doctor, Shem Tov said. “I was able to explain to him that I have asthma and won’t be able to be here without an inhaler, and they got me an inhaler.”\nShem Tov was held in this tunnel in pitch-black darkness, with a light that could hold for barely a couple of hours, “and even that gradually decreased,” he said, adding that he would disconnect the lamp to conserve energy so he could eat with light.\nShem Tov’s diet in captivity dwindled from two pitas a day to a biscuit and a small amount of salty water, he said. “I was extremely thin, extremely, I could already see the bones of my shoulders and ribs,” he said. Ahead of his release, he said, his captors fattened him up with chocolate, chicken and rice.\nIllustrative: This image released by the IDF on November 23, 2023, shows a Hamas tunnel entrance inside a mosque in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya. (Israel Defense Forces)\nHe said he passed the time by trying to sleep as much as possible so that he could dream of his family and friends. In his waking hours, he would talk with God.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Everyone asks him for stuff but nobody asks how he’s doing,” said Shem Tov. “So I would always start with, ‘Are you okay?’… and then first thing, I would express thanks… for being alive, for breathing, for the food I have.” Then, he said, he would make requests: “Put me on the right path, help me get home safely… keep my family safe.”\nShem Tov was later taken to a larger cell — “from my perspective, the paradise of the tunnels” — where he would be held for some 400 days until his release. For the first time, he was able to shower.\nAfter so much time without bathing, “You can really peel the filth off of you, from the chest and neck… black as coal,” Shem Tov said.\nHe was allowed to eat with his captors, and recalled his captors taunting him for the way he scarfed down his first meal. “They look at me as I’m eating, and I hear them saying, ‘pig, pig, Jew pig,'” said Shem Tov. “And I’m eating, I don’t care.”\nIDF troops operate inside Gaza during the ongoing ground offensive against Hamas, November 21, 2023. (IDF Spokesman)\n“One day we’re eating and I say to them, I’ll clear” the dishes, said Shem Tov. From that, he said, there developed “kind of an unspoken agreement that… I do things, and you just be nice to me. And I ended up spending most of my time in the kitchen there.”\nHe said he soon took over cooking and some basic maintenance tasks in the tunnel — so much so that ahead of his release his captors asked him for tips about the place’s upkeep. He also made his captors laugh: When one asked what he wanted to work as, Shem Tov said he wanted to be an actor. The terrorist then asked Shem Tov to imitate him. The imitation delighted the captor.\n“The fact that I connected with him saved me,” said Shem Tov.\nShem Tov was among the last hostages to be released in the latest hostage release and ceasefire deal. The agreement’s first phase saw Hamas release 33 women, children, civilian men over 50 and those deemed “humanitarian cases.” The first phase expired on March 2, a day after Shem Tov was released, amid Israel’s refusal to negotiate the second part, which would have required the IDF to fully withdraw from Gaza.\nHamas sparked outrage in Israel by holding propaganda ceremonies when handing over the hostages to the Red Cross. At his ceremony, Shem Tov was forced to kiss the head of the terrorists next to him.\nIsraeli civilian hostage Omer Shem Tov, center, wearing an approximation of an IDF uniform, is flanked by armed Hamas fighters before being handed over to the Red Cross in a propaganda ceremony in Nuseirat, central Gaza Strip, February 22, 2025.

It should be everyone,” said Shem Tov. He added that he did not think military force would get the hostages out.\nAsked why there were still captives in Gaza, he said: “I think it’s a political issue.”\nTerror groups in Gaza are still holding 59 hostages, including the remains of a soldier killed fighting in the 2014 Gaza war. At least 35 captives have been confirmed dead."}

(Sue Surkes/Times of Israel)\nKibbutz Gvulot, just over 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) from the Gaza Strip, was not invaded on October 7. Lacking rifles, security team members who had pistols went to help fight terrorists in Kibbutz Holit, about a 15-minute drive away.\nIt is nevertheless one of 66 localities within the Gaza border area — including the city of Sderot — whose security teams are undergoing one day of training per month over the course of a year, for a total of 12 days. Eight of those sessions will count toward the participants’ military reserve duty and are being funded by the IDF, while the remaining four days are paid for by a private NGO, Magen Yehuda, and its program, Magen 48.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFirst-response security teams on Israel’s borders are the responsibility of the army, with each community required to have at least 24 members who are trained and armed by the IDF. These members, however, are volunteers, often fathers in their 30s and 40s who have completed compulsory military service and are willing to be on call to defend their villages and towns. One of them is appointed commander and may also serve as the civilian security coordinator, whose salary is paid by the army and the local authority.\nThe group from Kibbutz Gvulot, which hopes to double in size, represented the spectrum of Israeli society. Members included a farmer and a history teacher, and served in a range of combat units such as the Golani and Paratrooper infantry brigades as well as the elite Navy Seals. Many had chalked up hundreds of days of reserve duty in Gaza during the ongoing war against Hamas there.\nLocked out, under-equipped, and poorly coordinated\nUntil the October 7 massacre, the IDF provided men like these with two yearly sessions of limited training, usually at a shooting range.\nWhen Hamas invaded and the army was initially overwhelmed, defense fell largely on the shoulders of these first response teams, 46 of whose members were murdered in the line of duty.\nBeryl and Doreen Eckstein (center and right) pose with a kibbutz electrician outside the weaponry store at Kibbutz Kfar Aza, close to the Gaza border, January 3, 2024. (Sue Surkes/Times of Israel)\nAlong the Gaza border, none of the teams had been trained in pistol use. Some lacked assault rifles or were unable to access locked armories. According to a series of IDF post-October 7 probes, the training of these teams was not standardized and coordination between them, the army, and other organizations was often poor.\nIn August 2022, following a series of break-ins and gun thefts, the army instructed all Gaza border security teams to return their assault rifles. It conditioned their return on the installation of safe storage places, either at home or in local armories. The decision left many unable to defend themselves against the massive waves of well-armed invading terrorists.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBecause these were not installed in Sderot by October 7, for example, the security team there was not prepared to help defend the city. In all, 53 people were killed in Sderot that day, including 37 civilians, 11 police officers, two firefighters, and three IDF soldiers.\nIn Be’eri, the two security members with keys to the armory were killed before they could open it, and in Nahal Oz, the armory remained locked when power went out and the only man with a key for manual use was killed.\nPresident Isaac Herzog meets the security team of Kibbutz Ein Hashlosha near the Gaza border in southern Israel on October 7, 2024. (Koby Gideon)\nThe secret of Kibbutz Erez\nImmediately after October 7, Ra’anana-based Australian immigrant Ari Briggs teamed up with his long-time friend Elan Isaacson to understand what had happened so that he could brief Jewish communities overseas.\nAri Briggs. (Courtesy)\nBriggs is a business consultant and former director of the international department at the right-wing Regavim organization. Isaacson, who moved with his family from South Africa to Israel as a child, spent decades growing flowers on an agricultural cooperative near the Gaza border. After the last major flare-up with Hamas in 2014, Isaacson traded chrysanthemum cultivation for the job of security chief at the Eshkol Regional Council.\nTraveling between farming communities with Isaacson, Briggs discovered that the security team at Kibbutz Erez had fared better than elsewhere, managing to prevent the terrorists from entering the community and avoiding civilian casualties.\nOne member of the security team, Amir Naim, was killed during the fighting. The team gathered at the highest point in the kibbutz, from which they could see two pickup trucks full of terrorists heading their way, Ben Sadan, another member of the squad, told Ynet. They opened fire on them and a ferocious gunfight ensued, with “grenades, RPGs, insane gunfire,” he said. Naim was critically wounded and died in battle.\nDuring his visit to Kibbutz Erez, Briggs asked the team how they survived, and they said, “‘Ehud Dribben’s training.’ So I chased Ehud down,” he said.\nDribben, a counterterrorism instructor who has worked with the IDF and police forces and militaries around the world, established the NGO Magen Yehuda (Shield of Judah) in 2004 as a vehicle through which to voluntarily train 64 first-response teams, many of them in the West Bank.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe trained the Kibbutz Erez team before October 7, having been contacted by a mutual friend of one of the team members.\nDanny Epstein, a member of the Kibbutz Erez security team. (Courtesy)\n“We had had one to two days of practice each year, mainly at shooting ranges,” recalled Danny Epstein, a member of Kibbutz Erez’s security team who helped fight Hamas terrorists on the kibbutz fence for three hours on October 7, sustaining a gunshot to his throat.\n“We felt the difference as soon as Ehud came in. He told us what the aim was, his security perspective, and what he expected from us as a security team, from working as individuals to members of small cells to a group.”\nDribben had them operating under scenarios of live fire, explosions, smoke, and more, and in simulations with wounded people and hostages.\n“We carried out exercises that were relatively complex within the kibbutz,” Epstein said. “It created a better bond between us. We know how to work better together now.”\nNo standardized training\nBriggs and Dribben conceived of Magen 48 this past August. The name was based on the understanding that 48 security team members had fallen on October 7. Confusingly, the IDF’s Gaza Division, with which Dribben worked on the details of the program, decided to call its project to improve civilian-military relations Magen 46, as two of the fallen were not from the Gaza border area.\nElan Isaacson, head of security at the Eshkol Regional Authority in southern Israel, photographed at the authority on March 25, 2025. (Sue Surkes/Times of Israel)\nAn IDF spokeswoman said the army had taken inspiration from the NGO’s name, adding, “These are two separate programs with the same name, with the same aim, and wherever we can, we will help.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nBoth the IDF and Magen 48 denied that the army has effectively outsourced part of its training to the private sector.\n“It’s a trial that the Gaza Division Commander has approved to upgrade the civilian first response teams,” said Isaacson. “The army is taking responsibility, and we are supplementing it.”\nKey to the project are tailored defense plans, 23 of which have been produced so far. These are made after a reserve lieutenant colonel has toured the community with the local security liaison to understand the layout, where attacks are likely to come from, and how it should be defended. Exercises based on the defense plans are conducted twice in conjunction with the IDF. According to Briggs, seeing that the IDF is involved in such a professional initiative is key to rebuilding confidence in the military that was shattered on October 7.\n“People said it’s [a job] for the bigger organizations, the government to deal with,” Briggs quipped. “But I’m the crazy Australian, and I know that the government comes in once a program is successful.”\nMembers of a security team during a Magen 48 training exercise. (Magen Yehuda)\nThe standards for the training are the same in all communities, Dribben said, although the trainings are shaped to suit the location that’s being defended.\nThe course includes tactical skills, communication, various forms of target training, drone reconnaissance, emergency medical strategies, and team leadership training focused on real-time decision-making. Security teams, to which women had also signed up, required the same level of rifle competency as homefront combat soldiers and combat support personnel.\n“Every exercise, in every scenario, is timed, measured, and given marks,” Dribben said. “The whole system must be rebuilt in a long-term and professional way.”\nEhud Dribben (right) stresses a point with a volunteer security team member. (Magen Yehuda)\nBriggs has been visiting US Jewish communities, urging them to twin with the security teams of different Gaza border settlements to finance four of the 12 training sessions.\nIt costs $26,000 for one year, 20% less for the second year, and half that sum for the third, as the teams become more experienced. So far, he has raised support for 18 communities.\nIsaacson, a keen supporter of the new training scheme, said, “You can have the best schools, the best of everything, but if you don’t have the basics — security — it will be hard to bring the communities back and keep them there.”\n“It’s 100% the army’s job to defend us,” he went on. “But that’s not enough after October 7. Wherever you live in Israel, you need to take responsibility for your family and community.”\nBriggs added, “You don’t have to be Rambo to defend your community.”"}

The staff, she said, has had to write them.\nSince then, as the war in Gaza has dragged on, Sheba Medical Center has treated 46 people who were released from captivity. Shilo is now in charge of the hospital’s Returning to Life Center, a special unit dedicated to hostages and their families, where the staff is still learning how to navigate the mostly uncharted waters of caring for returning hostages.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“We’re learning and relearning and unlearning something very needed and unknown,” Shilo said.\nThe Times of Israel spoke with Shilo as well as staff members at Beilinson Hospital and Schneider Children’s Medical Center, which took in some of the 139 hostages released since the war began, to understand how the medical centers developed protocols to care for people who, Shilo said, “overcame the unthinkable.”\nProtesters demand the release of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, at a rally at Hostages Square, Tel Aviv, April 19, 2025. (Lior Rotstein/Hostages and Missing Families Forum)\nTrans-disciplinary teams\nIn the days following October 7, when Shilo first heard about the hospital’s initial preparations for taking in released hostages, she discovered that no internist was involved in the project.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“You have to have an internist,” Shilo recalled telling the hospital management.  She felt a “very strong internal instinct” telling her that she had the tools needed for the project.\nAs the war continued to rage, she thought, “I’m not a combat soldier. I’m not a trauma expert, but this is the one thing I can do.”\nShilo joined the team. As preparations continued in earnest, the hospital hired two actors for a simulation about what it might be like to receive the released hostages.\n“The only instructions for the actors were to sit in a wheelchair and look sad and moved,” Shilo said.\nThen came the temporary truce at the end of November 2023, when 105 hostages were released. Sheba Medical Center treated 30 hostages during that deal, and in another wave of releases during the first few months of 2024, it treated 16 more.\nDr. Noya Shilo, head of the Return to Life Center at Sheba Medical Center, awaits the arrival of the helicopter carrying returned hostages in January 2025. (Courtesy/Sheba Medical Center)\nThe physicians work together in what Shilo calls a “trans-disciplinary” team.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“I go with a psychiatrist to see patients,” she said. “I check their heart and take blood tests, and we talk about everything. Very interesting things come up, like shortness of breath, which is very physical, but then when we talk, we realize that this very physical shortness of breath becomes worse when the patient goes in an elevator, because it’s very crowded. So we get a much deeper and more integrated version of the story of what’s going on, and that’s the way you address it.”\nShilo said the staff referenced Dr. Zahava Solomon’s longitudinal study of 1973 Yom Kippur War prisoners of war in the decades following their release, finding that the “aftermath of the trauma can reveal itself years after.”\nWith Solomon’s study in mind, the staff has continued to focus on ways to maintain the health of the hostages for the long term.\nMost of the hostages are young people, Shilo said, so the goal isn’t “just preventive medicine.”\n“We’re working with longevity experts,” she said, and then “we’re telling the hostages, ‘You have to live until you’re 100. We want you to live long, healthy, happy lives, and we’re with you.’”\nFreed hostage Emily Damari being prepped for surgery on her left hand at Sheba Medical Center on March 2, 2025, after she was shot on October 7, 2023, and not given proper medical care during 15 months of Hamas captivity in Gaza. (Credit Pomi Ofi Tal)\nShilo also talked about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which is well-known, when “people sometimes get stuck or locked in their trauma, and they have ongoing symptoms which basically ruin their lives.”\nPost-traumatic growth\nBut PTSD has a “less well-known sister,” Shilo said, Post Traumatic Growth, or PTG, a term coined by American psychologists Richard Tedeschi and Lawrence Calhoun in the early 1990s.\n“People who went through severe, extreme trauma, the worst of traumas, can somehow not just learn to overcome it, but actually become stronger and find a more meaningful life,” Shilo said.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“You see enormous, enormous strength in overcoming and surviving this unbelievable atrocity,” she said. “We saw the post-traumatic growth from the beginning. We’re there to make room for it, and to do whatever we can to help each hostage on their own path, in their own pace, to get to the best place that they can.”\nShilo said it has been a “great responsibility and privilege” to work with the released hostages.\n“To see them reunite with their families, reunite with their lives, taking in the unbearable pain of their losses, taking in the unbearable pain of what happened to the State of Israel, and to see them not just coping, but finding meaning in what happened — the only way I can describe my task as that I’m doing it with holy reverence,” Shilo said.\nPsychological first aid for children\nIt is estimated that across the globe, some 2,500 to 4,000 children are abducted each year by non-state armed groups for the purposes of retaliation, intimidation, forced labor, recruitment by armed forces and sexual violence, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund.\nProf. Silvana Fennig, Schneider Children’s Medical Center (Courtesy/Schneider Children’s Medical Center)\nBut Prof. Silvana Fennig, a pediatric psychiatrist and director of the Schneider Children’s Hospital’s department of psychological medicine, told The Times of Israel that there are no guidelines available for treating children who have returned from captivity during a war because “it is extremely rare.”\nDuring the hostage deal completed in November 2023, 19 children and seven mothers were treated at Schneider Children’s Medical Center.\nThe staff used the principles of Psychological First Aid (PFA), which is designed to help people after crisis events, but they modified the guidelines to treat children.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFennig and four other researchers recently published their findings in the peer-reviewed journal Child Abuse and Neglect.\nFennig said one of the most important ideas they learned was to give the hostages a “transitional space, a place that isn’t fantasy and isn’t reality, but it’s not captivity.”\nShe stressed that they need “somewhere safe because life continues to be difficult.”\nAt first, the staff believed that the released hostages should leave the hospital and go home as soon as possible.\n“But these captives had no home to go to,” she said. The staff learned that the former captives needed time to get back “into balance and routine,” and time “to adjust to their new reality.”\nWith children, she said, “It’s also very important to figure out a way to communicate bad news.”\nEmilia Aloni, 5, is reunited with her grandmother after she was held hostage in Gaza, November 25, 2023. (Schneider Children’s Hospital)\n“We learned we had to work with the families to decide who would tell children who is alive and who is dead,” Fennig explained. “Telling the news itself is also traumatic. You have to give the task to someone they know, not a therapist.”\nFennig said that the children who coped the best in captivity had a caregiver.\n“Caregivers were very protective because they had to defend their kids,” she said.\nIt also surprised the staff that the children wanted to continue with the same routines they had while in almost two months of captivity.\nAgam Goldstein-Almog, left, and her little brothers Gal and Tal, in a Gaza tunnel on October 8, 2023, in a photo apparently obtained by the IDF (Instagram used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)\n“They wanted to wear the same kind of clothes that they wore in captivity,” she said. “If they were wearing short-sleeve shirts in captivity, they wanted to still wear short-sleeve shirts.”\nThis gives them continuity and a feeling of routine, “like reading the same story before bedtime,” Fennig said.\n“It’s not as obvious to kids where they are,” she said. “Even if it’s not logical for the staff, we understood and we went with it.”\n“Despite the deficiencies and the weight loss, the children did not experience anything physical that might be irreversible,” Fennig said. “However, the psychological damage is not always reversible.”\nDoron (right), and Yoni with their children Raz, left, and Aviv; Doron, Raz and Aviv were taken hostage by Hamas terrorists on October 7, 2023 and freed on November 24, 2023 (Courtesy/Schneider Children’s Hospital)\nIn a study of the released child hostages immediately after their release, Dr. Noa Ziv, a senior physician in the hospital’s pediatric department, and hospital staff members Dr. Yael Mozer-Glassberg and Dr. Havatzelet Yarden-Bilavsky, found the former hostages exhibited “the effects of psychological terror due to warfare strategies that included isolation, intimidation, lack of food and water, and emotional abuse.”\nThe long-term effects on children are still unknown.\n“I cannot tell what the future holds for them,” said Fennig, “but generally speaking, children who suffer post-traumatic stress disorder might experience anxiety and depression even years later.”\nCustomizing protocols\nDr. Michal Steinman, director of nursing at Beilinson Hospital, also emphasized that preparing for the returning hostages was like “detective work.”\nDr. Michal Steinman, director of nursing at Beilinson Hospital (Courtesy/Rami Zarnegar)\n“We combined a team of physicians, nurses, nutritionists, mental health workers, social workers, and whoever we thought should be part of this unit,” she said. “We went system by system, ears, eyes, mouth, hair, skin, kidneys, urine, whatever it is, muscles, to think what is happening to a person who is under those conditions of captivity.”\nFrom there, the staff customized protocols for 100 days in captivity, she said. But after 100 days, “we sat together again and built them for 200 days in captivity, and then for 300 days in captivity, and for 400 days in captivity, and so on.”\nIn February 2024, when the hospital received nine hostages, “I’m very proud to say that we thought about everything. There were no surprises. We were ready for everything. They are good protocols, but I hope for humanity that no one will ever have to use them again.”\nShe said that staff of the six hospitals that received the released hostages — including Soroka Medical Center, Sheba Medical Center, Wolfson Medical Center, Ichilov Hospital, Shamir Medical Center, and Schneider Children’s Hospital — shared their knowledge and worked together.\nFormer hostages and soldiers are in rehabilitation together\nAt Beilinson, the staff “made a custom-made treatment for each hostage,” Steinman said. “They still come to the hospital twice a week, and we’re still working with them personally.”\nSome of the released hostages are also working with the soldiers who got injured in Gaza while trying to release them, Steinman said. “So now the hostages and the soldiers are doing rehabilitation together,” she said.\nThe entrance to the tunnel in northern Gaza where the bodies of four Israeli hostages – Itzhak Gelerenter, Amit Buskila, Ron Benjamin and Shani Louk – were discovered in May 2023. (Lazar Berman/Times of Israel)\nThere are 59 hostages currently being held captive in Gaza. It is estimated that 21-24 of them are still alive.\nSteinman said that in tandem with their own rehabilitation, the released hostages are “fighting for their brothers and sisters still in Gaza.”\n“Some of the days that they are supposed to come to the hospital, they go abroad to speak with [US] President [Donald] Trump or other places,” she said. “They are not 100% in their rehabilitation process because of the other captives.”\nShe said that although set free, the hostages “always will have a part that stays in Gaza. When you have 500 days in captivity in Gaza, part of you will always stay there.”\nReleased hostage soldier Agam Berger meets her four comrades, Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, and Liri Albag, at Rabin Medical Center, January 30, 2025. (Israel Defense Forces)\nAs much as the staff helps the hostages, they have also taught the staff “many lessons,” said Steinman.\n“How to survive and use your intelligence and all the tools that you have to survive another 24 hours, and not get crazy,” she said. “It’s amazing all the methods they developed and how they did it. They are the real meaning of a strong human spirit.”"}

The UN and international organizations briefed on the plan issued a statement earlier this week saying they won’t cooperate with the initiative, saying it fails to sufficiently address the humanitarian crisis and “weaponizes” aid.\nMaj. Gen. Ghassan Alian, who heads the Coordinator for Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer’s aide Moran Stav, visited the UAE Thursday to meet with Emirati Minister for International Cooperation Reem Al Hashimy, hoping to convince Abu Dhabi to back the plan, the senior official said, confirming reporting by the Walla news site.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nHashimy told the Israeli officials that the UAE would not be able to provide such financial support because the GHF initiative — as it currently stands — does not properly address the humanitarian crisis, the official said.\nThe official stressed that Abu Dhabi’s position could change if the initiative is adapted to properly meet the moment.\nA Western diplomat told The Times of Israel earlier this week that GHF was planning to go public with the roll-out of its new initiative this week, but the lack of international support appears to be delaying the announcement.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOrganizers sufficed with a press conference held Friday by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, where he said the effort was already underway, but offered minimal details on how the initiative would work while calling on the international community to back the program.\nPalestinians struggle to obtain donated food at a community kitchen in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, Friday, May 9, 2025. (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)\nIn the meantime, the Trump administration is pressuring international humanitarian organizations to cooperate with the new plan, three sources familiar with the matter told The Times of Israel this week.\nAmid this pushback from various groups, the Trump administration has indicated to these organizations — including the World Food Program — that their US funding could be slashed if they do not cooperate, a staffer at an international aid group, a senior Western diplomat and an Israeli official told The Times of Israel.\nA GHF memo obtained by The Times of Israel on Thursday acknowledges that civilians in Gaza are currently “enduring extreme deprivation,” but says the “Secure Distribution Sites” (SDS) it will establish to distribute aid will initially only serve 1.2 million people, while the population in the Strip is about 2 million people.\nThe memo states that the four SDSs will have the “capacity to expand past 2 million,” but it doesn’t specify how long the initial phase will last.\nMoreover, GHF acknowledges that it will take time for each of the four SDSs to even meet the initial goal of serving 300,000 individuals.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAn Israeli official told The Times of Israel Wednesday that Israel is hoping that some countries will begin to take in Palestinians, which would help minimize the discrepancy between the aid initiative’s initial capacity and Gaza’s total population.\nBut no countries have volunteered to date, and while Israel touts the emigration option as “voluntary,” countries in the region are increasingly viewing it as forced, given that Israel’s military operations are ongoing and expected to significantly intensify shortly if a ceasefire and hostage deal is not reached by the end of US President Donald Trump’s trip to the region next week.\nA Palestinian man eats flat bread made with ground lentils during a flour shortage, as a woman bakes a new batch in the Jabalia camp in the northern Gaza Strip on May 6, 2025 (Omar AL-QATTAA / AFP)\nThe Israeli official said that the IDF recognizes that Gazans are “nearing starvation,” given that aid has not entered the Strip since the collapse of a ceasefire with Hamas on March 1. Accordingly, the Israeli plan is to resume aid in the coming days or weeks.\nStill, the goal of the new initiative with GHF is to ensure that aid is not diverted by Hamas, something Israel says it hasn’t succeeded in doing since the start of the war.\nCritics have argued that the government’s refusal to stand up a viable Palestinian alternative to Hamas has allowed the terror group to remain a dominant force in Gaza, even if it has taken debilitating blows due to Israeli military activities.\nThe aid distribution hubs, or SDSs, will be established in a new humanitarian zone that Israel is creating in southern Gaza between the Philadelphi Corridor, along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, and the newly established Morag Corridor that is located roughly five kilometers north. The area largely constitutes the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Those entering the zone will pass through army checkpoints, in what the IDF hopes will prevent Hamas fighters from reaching the area.\nAid will be distributed from the SDSs in boxes that will contain 50 1,750-calorie meals, hygiene kits and medical supplies, according to the memo. Five to six thousand vetted representatives will be allowed to travel by foot to the aid hubs once every week or two in order to pick up a roughly 40-pound (18-kilogram) box of food for their families, said officials briefed on the plan.\n“To ensure the integrity and safety of aid delivery, GHF’s logistics subcontractors will utilize armored vehicles to transport supplies to and from SDS locations,” the memo states. The subcontractors will include American security firms, such as UG Solutions and Safe Reach Solutions, which helped secure the Netzarim Corridor earlier this year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe IDF will not be stationed at or near the SDSs in order to “maintain the neutral and civilian-facing nature of operations,” the memo said. Instead, they will secure the perimeter of the humanitarian zone.\nPalestinians try to receive a hot meal prepared by volunteers in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, May 6, 2025. (Abed Rahim Khatib/Flash90)\nAn international aid group staffer briefed on the plan told The Times of Israel earlier this week that it does not take into account the current reality in the Strip, where hungry Gazans desperate for food are likely to flood the aid hubs once they are opened.\nThe staffer also took issue with the mechanism’s plan to only facilitate the entry of 60 trucks into Gaza each day from one crossing, saying the amount does not come close to what will be needed to feed the already-malnourished Gazan population.\nUS special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff briefed ambassadors of Security Council countries on the aid initiative on Wednesday in New York.\nGHF is still working to put together its leadership, after it was established earlier this year, but Israeli and US officials have been in talks with former World Food Program executive director David Beasley about heading the foundation, a Western diplomat said.\nThe Axios news site cited a source close to Beasley who said the former WFP chief and Nobel laureate is negotiating the urgent reintroduction of aid in Gaza as a condition for him coming on board."}

Israel has said the Hamas terror group has previously stolen much of the aid entering the territory, using it to maintain control over the population.\nIsrael and the US both indicated in recent days that they were preparing to restore aid through mechanisms that would bypass Hamas.\nAmbassador Mike Huckabee said Friday that several partners had already committed to taking part in the aid arrangement but declined to name them, saying details would be released in the coming days.\nHuckabee also rejected the notion that Washington was “pulling away” from close ties with Jerusalem or that it was trying to sidestep the Israeli government, describing the relations as very close, the day after a report claimed that the Trump administration was no longer demanding that Saudi Arabia recognize Israel as part of a nuclear pact with Riyadh.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“Under Trump, the special relationship has never been stronger,” he told reporters at the US Embassy in Jerusalem.\nUS Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee holds a press conference at the US Embassy in Jerusalem, May 9, 2025.

Two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters Thursday that ties with Israel were no longer an American prerequisite.\nHuckabee did not comment on the report specifically.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe ambassador also argued that it was “wholly inaccurate” to describe the humanitarian aid initiative being launched in Gaza as Israeli, saying media reports characterizing it as such were “off the mark.”\nHuckabee confirmed that the aid operation “is ongoing” but said Israel’s involvement will only be “on the perimeters” in securing the aid distribution zones.\n“They’re not bringing the food or distributing it,” he said, adding that the Israelis “are supportive” of the plan. “They care very much about humanitarian aid to Gaza, but they also care that Hamas doesn’t steal the aid.”\nOfficials familiar with the plan have told The Times of Israel that the Israeli government and military have been heavily involved in putting together its details, even if a new international organization — the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — will be the one managing the initiative and the Israel Defense Forces won’t be the one to distribute the aid.\nAsked by The Times of Israel how a potential ceasefire with Hamas could affect the initiative if it requires an IDF withdrawal to buffer zones, Huckabee said that “any ceasefire still requires security,” and the focus in any case will be getting the food to the Gazan population. He also said that humanitarian aid wasn’t dependent on the existence of a ceasefire.\nHe stated that the key elements of the plan were to get food distributed efficiently and safely, and prevent the Hamas terror group from getting its hands on it and stealing it. He panned Hamas as “100% responsible for the horrific situation” in the enclave, accusing the group’s leaders of “starving their people” and preventing a solution. He urged unanimous international condemnation of its “torturing of hostages in tunnels.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nHuckabee said the aid initiative involves many groups, nonprofits and agencies, not all of whom can be named.\nBut he acknowledged that alongside the “good initial response,” many challenges remain and an “extraordinary amount of planning” is required.\nSmoke rises following an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip, as seen from southern Israel, May 8, 2025.

However, the US ambassador acknowledged that the initiative “won’t be perfect — especially in its early days.”\n“It is a logistical challenge to make this work,” he said.\nMeanwhile, Hebrew media reported Friday that US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had canceled a visit to Israel that had been planned for the coming days.\nAn Axios report earlier this week said Hegseth was intending to arrive in Israel on May 12, a day before Trump begins his trip to Saudi Arabia, followed by Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It would have been Hegseth’s first trip to Israel as defense secretary, and he was slated to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz.\nBut several outlets said the visit had been canceled, though no explanation was given.\nOn Thursday, Huckabee told Israel’s Channel 12 news that US actions against the Iran-backed Houthis depended on whether they harm American citizens. His comments followed Trump’s surprise announcement on Tuesday of a bilateral ceasefire agreement, after which the rebel group vowed to continue its attacks on Israel.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsrael was caught by surprise by the agreement, officials said, leading to further speculation as to the state of Israel-American ties. It was announced by Trump two days after a Houthi missile impacted the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport, lightly injuring several people and prompting most foreign airlines to halt flights to Israel.\n“The United States isn’t required to get permission from Israel to make some type of arrangement that would get the Houthis [to refrain] from firing on our ships,” Huckabee said in a clip from the full interview, set to air on the network this weekend.\nAt the same time, he added, “There’s 700,000 Americans living in Israel. If the Houthis want to continue doing things to Israel and they hurt an American, then it becomes our business.”\nSmoke in the area of Ben Gurion Airport after a ballistic missile was fired at Israel from Yemen on May 4, 2025 (Screen grab from social media used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)\nAsked by Channel 12 to clarify whether he meant that the US would only intervene to fight the rebel group if a US citizen was hurt by a Houthi missile, the ambassador said, “It’s a matter of what becomes our immediate business.”\nHis remarks echoed those made by Trump, who, when asked about the Houthis pledging to continue attacking Israel notwithstanding their agreement with the US, responded, “I’ll discuss that if something happens.”\nOn Wednesday, the Houthis fired a drone at Israel, which was intercepted. They fired a ballistic missile on Friday, which was also destroyed en route.\nThe Houthis — whose slogan calls for “death to America, death to Israel, a curse on the Jews” — have been firing at Israel and on shipping routes in the Red Sea since November 2023, saying that they are doing so in a show of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza amid the war there, which erupted when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed southern Israel on October 7, 2023, to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHouthi attacks on commercial shipping largely ceased six months ago, though this was after many international companies rerouted their vessels to avoid the Red Sea. Attacks on Israel and other military targets were halted for several weeks earlier this year, but restarted when a ceasefire in Gaza collapsed in early March.\nThe US intensified strikes on Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis earlier this year to stop attacks on Red Sea shipping, after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli ships passing through the Red Sea and Arabian Sea, the Bab al-Mandab Strait and the Gulf of Aden.\nThe missile attack on Ben Gurion Airport on Sunday prompted sweeping Israeli airstrikes on Yemen’s Hodeidah port and other Houthi infrastructure targets on Monday. The strikes were followed on Tuesday by further attacks that the Israeli military said had “completely disabled” Sanaa International Airport in the Houthi-controlled capital.\nNava Freiberg and agencies contributed to this report."}

(Charlie Summers/Times of Israel)\n“Out of despair and her survival instinct, the mother throws her eldest son — maybe the wolves will be satisfied with him — but their hunger only intensifies. She throws her second son, then the third, and in the end when she alone remains, the wolves devour her,” Odeh recounted. “This is exactly how fascism works. It pursues the opposition, and the opposition, frightened, rushes to sacrifice us all.”\nOdeh likened the panicked mother to the anti-Netanyahu opposition, which he claimed gave up on peace with the Palestinians, and soon after, on partnership with Arab Israeli leadership.\n“I want to put before you a crucial proposition — the historic role of Arab citizens. Without us, it is possible to build a dictatorship, but without us, it is impossible to build a democracy,” he said.\n“Even during this excruciating and bloody war, Jews and Arabs — you all — continued to have faith in each other and believed that only together we can win,” he continued, invoking the well-known wartime slogan."}

Additionally, during the second ceasefire between February 1 and March 17 of this year, 4,259 Gazans — including patients, wounded individuals, and their family members — were evacuated from the Strip for medical treatment abroad.\nLeaving Gaza requires international intervention\nIsrael’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the body under the Defense Ministry responsible for coordinating the movement of Gaza residents, has maintained that the only criteria for exiting Gaza — both before and throughout the war — are severe illness or injury, or foreign citizenship. In all cases, residents cannot apply directly to COGAT; an international organization must submit the request on their behalf.\nIt is notable that many countries accepting patients from Gaza during the war, including the UAE and various European states, have clarified that these are temporary stays for medical treatment and that the individuals are expected to return afterward.\nRelated: Almost half of Gaza Palestinians willing to ask Israel to help them leave — poll\nSince the war began, the World Health Organization has been responsible for coordinating the evacuation of patients and their companions from the Gaza Strip.

Following the Israeli ground operation in Rafah on May 6, 2024, the crossing was closed.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn June 2024, Israel began allowing patients to exit Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Israel and then into Jordan by vehicle via the Allenby Bridge.

Since last February, some Gazan patients have been allowed to fly directly from Israel via Ramon Airport in the Negev in the south of Israel. (Until then, Ramon Airport in southern Israel was not used for international flights.)\nThe WHO publishes an online chart that is updated every few weeks to show the number of individuals evacuated from Gaza. According to the data, from the collapse of the ceasefire on March 18 until May 6, a total of 310 people — patients and companions — were evacuated.\nForeign nationals still waiting to exit\nTo exit Gaza as a foreign citizen — including dual citizens —  during the war, the individual’s country must submit a formal request to COGAT and provide proof of citizenship and presence in Gaza. Gazan residents cannot request exit permits from Israel directly.\nWhen the Rafah crossing was open from November 2023 to May 2024, foreign nationals used it to reach Egypt. Most were asked to pay between $2,000 and $5,000 per person to Egyptian companies managing the crossing.\nNotably, even Gazans without foreign citizenship were able to leave by paying the same amount, including senior Hamas figures such as the Hamas-run health ministry spokesperson, Ashraf al-Qudra, who reportedly exited the Strip this way during the war.\nA Palestinian stranded in Egypt waits to cross Rafah crossing to the Gaza Strip at Rafah, Egypt, after a temporary truce came into effect, November 27, 2023.

COGAT confirmed to The Times of Israel that eligibility was strictly limited to holders of foreign citizenship, not those with visas or other legal residency forms.\nPalestinians wait to board a bus at Al-Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis after permission from the Israeli authorities was given for 11 children suffering from cancer to leave Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing to receive treatment in Jordan, August 15, 2024.

His wife and two daughters live in Europe, where he has resided for the past decade. He requested that his full name and identifying details not be published.\nIn September 2023, Ahmad traveled to Gaza for a family visit. Once the war broke out, he attempted to leave and return home. His first attempt via Rafah was denied by Israel on the grounds of “security concerns.” Later, with legal assistance from Gisha, he petitioned Israel’s High Court of Justice to leave. Israel responded after long months that it had no objection to his departure, and a week after the petition was withdrawn, his exit via Kerem Shalom crossing was coordinated.\nAhmad left Gaza after 15 months of trying, despite holding foreign citizenship and having immediate family abroad.\nIn a WhatsApp conversation with The Times of Israel, Ahmad described the experience as deeply frustrating: “Throughout the process, the official bodies responsible for handling this had failed. The citizen is the last priority.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nGazans leave following requests by foreign governments\nDespite official Israeli statements asserting that only foreign nationals or individuals in need of urgent medical care are allowed to exit Gaza, approximately 290 Gaza residents have left the Strip since the March collapse of the ceasefire. According to foreign media reports, official statements, and a source familiar with the issue who spoke with The Times of Israel, they left through foreign government intervention and not for medical reasons, and some of them did not have foreign citizenship.\nAlthough COGAT told The Times of Israel that the only valid exit criteria are illness, injury, or foreign citizenship, several Gazans have traveled to Europe over the past two months without meeting these conditions. For example, 13 students left for Ireland on student visas, and several individuals traveled to France, including Gazans who had worked for French institutions in Gaza, their relatives, academics granted scholarships, and students with study visas.\nWhen The Times of Israel asked which documents were required for these exits to be approved, the embassies of Ireland and France in Israel declined to respond. However, the French embassy confirmed that it had worked for several months to secure the departure of those Gaza residents.\nAmong them were the 13 students accepted to academic institutions in Ireland, along with family members of Irish citizens. The Irish embassy in Israel declined to specify the total number of evacuees. One Irish newspaper reported that among them was a 74-year-old woman, the mother of an Irish citizen, who had waited 18 months to leave Gaza.\nPalestinians flee Beit Lahiya, in the northern Gaza Strip, March 25, 2025.

A source familiar with the matter, who spoke to The Times of Israel on condition of anonymity, said that additional Gazans had left for Canada — likely relatives of Canadian citizens — as well as for the UK. The Canadian and British embassies in Israel did not respond to inquiries regarding the exact number of people evacuated.\nExcept for one instance — a March 31 flight that took 33 German nationals and their relatives directly to Germany — all others were transferred from the Kerem Shalom crossing through Israel to Jordan by vehicle and then flown onward to Europe.\nMany of these individuals had reportedly been trying to leave Gaza for months, some since the start of the war. Following the March 31 evacuation to Germany, German officials acknowledged: “We would have preferred to do this sooner — it took us time.”\nIn total, at least 284 people are confirmed to have left Gaza for foreign destinations. The exact number is unknown, but given the significant restrictions imposed by foreign governments and Israel, it is unlikely to be much higher.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross helped coordinate the exit of these residents and foreign nationals through the Kerem Shalom crossing. It declined to tell The Times of Israel how many people it assisted over the past two months.\nPalestinians leaving Gaza arrive in the Egyptian part of the Rafah border crossing, November 12, 2023. (AFP)\nIsraeli statements contradict reality\nThe Israeli organization Gisha reported that it had recently received inquiries from 150 Gaza residents who had been accepted to study abroad but were still unable to leave the Strip. COGAT has stated that acceptance to academic programs overseas does not meet the criteria for exit.\nShai Greenberg, spokesperson for Gisha, told The Times of Israel: “Since the beginning of the war, thousands of people have been trapped in the Gaza Strip — including foreign nationals, patients in need of life-saving medical treatment unavailable in Gaza, students accepted into graduate programs abroad, and individuals eligible for family reunification in various countries.\n“This is part of a systematic violation of fundamental rights — including freedom of movement and the right to family life for both those trapped and their relatives in Gaza and abroad — as well as the rights to health, bodily integrity, education, and livelihood,” Greenberg stated.\nAhmad, who left Gaza in February after 15 months of effort, told The Times of Israel he knows many foreign nationals who remain stuck in the Strip.\n“I know a lot of people with foreign citizenship or permanent residency abroad who are still trapped in Gaza — some of them are close friends. Only one of them managed to leave, about 20 days ago,” he said.\nPalestinians in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, hold anti-war signs as a man chants slogans in support of the people of Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, who have been protesting against Hamas, March 26, 2025.

The budget will not be an obstacle — if we remove 5,000 people a day, it will take a year,” he said.\nThe data, however, appears to be in stark contrast to official Israeli rhetoric promising and encouraging the emigration of Gaza residents. Even under Israel’s strict criteria — limited to foreign nationals and those requiring urgent care — only a small number of Gazans have successfully exited the Strip."}

(res.) Ran Cohen Rochverger noted that the decision not to strengthen enforcement against evaders has largely benefited the ultra-Orthodox community, which constitutes the bulk of draft evaders in Israel.\nAccording to Rochverger, some six weeks after October 7, the IDF implemented a new, stricter enforcement policy “significantly lowering the threshold for prosecution” for desertion so that “even relatively short\nabsences” from service, which would previously have been grounds for non-judicial punishment, would be grounds for criminal charges.\n00:00 / 23:33\nThis led to a significant increase in the number of indictments filed against reservists in the period before the termination of this policy in late April 2025.\nIn one case listed by Rochverger, an IDF reservist was sentenced to 90 days in prison after being absent without leave for six weeks, although he was suffering from a mental condition that resulted in the lowering of his service profile.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nMany IDF reservists have gone through multiple rounds of duty, totaling hundreds of days, leading to severe economic stress.\nIsraeli Infantry reservists during light arms training in the Golan Heights before heading south to the Gaza Strip, October 8, 2023. (Michael Giladi/Flash90)\nAt the same time as it bolstered the punishment for desertion, the IDF “avoided lowering the standard criminal prosecution standard in relation to evaders,” Rochverger wrote.\nThe army has stated that it currently needs some 12,000 new soldiers to meet manpower needs amid the ongoing war, 7,000 of whom would be combat troops.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCurrently, approximately 80,000 Haredi men between the ages of 18 and 24 are eligible for military service and have not enlisted. The IDF has sent out 18,915 initial draft orders to members of the Haredi community in several waves since July 2024, but, as of late April, only 232 of those who received orders have enlisted — 57 of them in combat roles.\nSpeaking with The Times of Israel on Wednesday evening, Rochverger asserted that while the IDF’s policies do not explicitly reference Haredim, and enforcement is the same against all draft evaders, this is not the whole story.\n“Draft evaders are treated in a much more lenient way than deserters,” he said. “And of course there are still secular draft evaders, but there are many, many Haredi evaders, so… the Haredi evaders did not suffer at all according to this enforcement policy,” he said.\nFor draft dodgers classified as deserters, “the courts did increase the severity of punishments, but to a much more moderate and limited extent,” and not as part of any overarching military policy, he added.\nAsked for comment, the army told The Times of Israel in a statement that it “enforces the law against the phenomenon of absenteeism, without any distinction regarding the identity of the accused who commit the offense or their affiliation with one or another population group.”\n“Since the beginning of the war, and in light of the severe consequences of this phenomenon, the Military Prosecution Office has updated its policy regarding absenteeism, and, among other things, has requested more onerous punishment, due to the severe impact of the phenomenon on the war effort,” the IDF stated.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA military police officer speaks with imprisoned Israeli soldiers at Prison Four, Israel’s largest military prison, located at the Tzrifin military base on April 26, 2018.

There has also been a tightening of the disciplinary policy with respect to draft evaders, and this is implemented consistently, taking into account the circumstances of each individual case,” it said.\nAddressing the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Wednesday, Brig. Gen. Shay Tayeb, head of the IDF Personnel Directorate’s Planning and Personnel Management Division, said that the IDF has three main enforcement mechanisms: stopping people at Ben Gurion Airport, random police checks, and dedicated operations against evaders.\nSuch operations have been limited over the last year-and-a-half as the bulk of the military police’s resources have been tied up in imprisoning captured terrorists, he stated.\nAs of early February, arrest warrants had been issued for 1,212 Haredim who ignored enlistment orders, a number that has likely increased in the interim.\nThe consequences of being declared a draft evader include receiving a “no exit order” — being barred from leaving the country — and during any encounter with the police, the draft dodger can be arrested.\nThe IDF Military Police does not actually carry out arrests of those who do not show up to induction centers, but instead waits until they are declared draft evaders and leaves it to law enforcement.\nAt the same time, the IDF seems determined to increase enlistment of the ultra-Orthodox, with Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir on Tuesday ordering the IDF Personnel Directorate to immediately provide a plan to “expand and maximize” the number of draft orders sent to young ultra-Orthodox men — enraging the Haredi community.\nUltra-Orthodox Jews are dragged by police while demonstrating against the IDF draft outside the Jerusalem enlistment center, April 28, 2025.

The panel responsible for the “7 October Parliamentary Commission Report” was chaired by Andrew Roberts, a renowned historian, biographer and expert on warfare, from the Battle of Waterloo to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\nIt isn’t simply Roberts’s longstanding support for Israel that led him to agree to chair the commission, but his concern over continuing attempts to whitewash Hamas’s atrocities — an effort he compares to Holocaust denial.\n“There’s a movement afoot on behalf of Hamas and its sympathizers to pretend that October 7 never happened,” he tells The Times of Israel. The report’s aim was to compile “a large amount of unimpeachable evidence to prove that it did.”\nWith an eye on history, Roberts also wanted to gather irrefutable proof to ensure that, in future decades, “the deniers” can still be challenged, even in the absence of living eyewitnesses.\nRoberts, who is not Jewish, does not underestimate the scale of the challenge.\n“It took decades for Holocaust denial to really get going,” he says, “but October 7 denial started while the actual massacres were still going [on].”\nHe recognizes that Hamas’s denial of its crimes contains multiple grim ironies. Pointing to the GoPro cameras worn by the terrorists as they perpetrated murder, torture and rape, he notes the group and its allies are “attempting to deny something that they themselves have provided the best evidence for.”\nRoberts also believes that Hamas is trying to “have their cake and eat it.”\n“They are trying to celebrate something they deny happened, and deny something that they’ve celebrated happening,” he says. “It’s unlike anything else, really. Speaking as a historian, you’ve got to come down on one side or the other about an occasion [or] a big historical event like October 7, and you’ve got to say that either it happened, and it was terrible, or that it didn’t happen.”\n“You can’t have it both ways, and yet that’s what Hamas and its supporters in the West are trying to get,” he adds.\nDepravity of human nature, filmed in real-time\nRoberts, who sits as a Conservative member of the House of Lords, and fellow members of the panel — who include Labour and Liberal Democrat parliamentarians and a former UK chief prosecutor — visited Israel and the scenes of some of the October 7 attacks. Roberts says it was both the “breadth as well as the depth” of the assault that struck him — not just the murder of some 1,200 people and abduction of 251, but the “depravity of human nature that was seen, the sheer cruelty, the sexual violence and the humiliation.”\nRoberts speaks of the “bloodlust” displayed by the assailants — they killed a 10-month-old baby and a Holocaust survivor in his 90s — as well as the “premeditation of the cruelty.”\nBlood is seen splattered in a child’s room following a massive Hamas terror onslaught on October 7, 2023, in Kibbutz Nir Oz, October 19, 2023 (AP/Francisco Seco)\nHistorically, he says, this is unusual. “Bloodlust happens a lot in history, but it’s very rare that it’s been set up so diligently and with such foresight — ‘malice aforethought’ as it used to be called,” he says.\nThe report of the 7 October Parliamentary commission, which was established by the All Party UK-Israel Parliamentary Group, isn’t an official publication of the House of Commons or the House of Lords. Roberts accepts that it has already been written off by some on social media as “Zionist propaganda” — the internet, he jokes, has become “the universal lavatory wall” — but he believes it cannot easily be “intellectually and rationally written off.”\n“Bloodlust happens a lot in history, but it’s very rare that it’s been set up so diligently and with such foresight — ‘malice aforethought’ as it used to be called”\nThe panel was careful to stick to verifiable facts, avoid speculation and focus simply on the events of October 7, he says.\n“We were not attempting to do what other reports could do better, which is to look into the intelligence failures and everything else that happened in the background to it,” Roberts says.\nThe report argues that Hamas knew that “military victory was unlikely” and instead sought to trigger an Israeli retaliation, which would isolate the country internationally and spark global outrage. However, Roberts disputes the notion that, on these terms, Hamas has already emerged victorious.\nIsraeli soldiers at the forensic center in the Shura military base near Ramle, where hundreds of bodies arrived after the October 7 Hamas onslaught, October 24, 2023. (Yossi Aloni/Flash90)\n“In terms of the propaganda war, I think they have won in that on these disgusting, ridiculous social media sites, like TikTok and Instagram, you’re getting… 10 times more anti-Israel propaganda than pro-Israeli facts and truth,” he acknowledges.\nBut, he continues, the war itself is not over and it won’t be possible to say either side has won until both sides have stopped fighting — a prospect that seems some way off. Indeed, quoting Winston Churchill’s famous words upon becoming UK prime minister in 1940, Roberts believes that Israel will eventually prevail, but it will take “a lot more blood, toil, tears and sweat.”\nCheckered history of surprise attacks\nRoberts’s belief that Hamas can be vanquished rests in part on the checkered history of surprise attacks. They may give the attacker a momentary advantage, but, with a “very few” exceptions — such as the 1967 Six Day War, when Israel launched a preemptive strike — they rarely lead to ultimate success. The Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Yom Kippur assault on Israel in October 1973, Argentina’s invasion of the Falkland Islands in April 1982, and Saddam Hussein’s grab for Kuwait in August 1990 did not see the aggressor triumph.\nWhile undertaking a surprise attack “seems like a good idea at the time… ultimately, it leads to a much worse situation for the people who launch [it],” believes Roberts. “If you launch a barbarous and vicious surprise attack, you shouldn’t be surprised about the response,” the historian says, noting the “holy rage and fury” that is stirred on the part of those who have been attacked.\n“If you launch a barbarous and vicious surprise attack, you shouldn’t be surprised about the response”\nThe author of an acclaimed biography of Churchill, Roberts has previously compared Israel’s position to that of Britain in 1940.\n“In that 12-month period from June 1940 to June 1941, Britain and her Commonwealth formed the tip of the spear against ‘the menace of tyranny,’ just as brave Israel today represents the tip of civilization’s spear against the tyranny and barbarism of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism and exterminationism,” he wrote in the Jewish Chronicle last October.\nRoberts readily admits, however, that Britain, which had not yet been joined by the US and Russia but had strong backing from the Empire and Commonwealth, was less alone than Israel is today. With the exception of the US, he says, “it’s difficult to look around the world and see countries that are really four-square behind Israel in what is essentially a struggle between civilization and barbarism.”\nHe worries that people in the West “enjoy attacking ourselves… and berating ourselves” for “perfectly reasonable” responses to surprise attacks such as 9/11 or October 7. He contrasts the response to Pearl Harbor.\nA handout photograph released by the UK Parliament shows Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, making a statement on the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 and the situation in the Middle East, in the House of Commons in London on October 7, 2024 (JESSICA TAYLOR / UK PARLIAMENT / AFP)\n“Nobody attacked FDR [who was US president at the outbreak of World War II], or, indeed at the time, [US] president Truman [under whose administration a nuclear bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki], for punishing the attack on Pearl Harbor as condignly as they did, whereas today, everybody seems to be leaping up and down, criticizing the West for punishing these equally horrific attacks,” Roberts says.\nNonetheless, Roberts is convinced that Churchill would have recognized and sympathized with Israel’s position today.\n“He was a Zionist. He didn’t subscribe to [the] antisemitism that so many of the people of his age, class and background did. He was a supporter of the Balfour Declaration and believed that the ‘Judeo’ side of Judeo-Christian civilization… gave Christianity its ethics and its positive moral angle,” he says.\nRoberts says that Churchill’s daughter had once warned him never to assume what the former prime minister would have said about any event after his death in 1965, but he is happy to wager an opinion.\n“It strikes me as very clear that he would have been as outraged as any other decent, rational, logical human being about what had happened on October 7, and he would certainly have been in favor of a terrible punishment raining down on Hamas,” Roberts says. “He was a humanitarian and so he’d have wanted to have minimized the civilian casualties in Gaza, and I believe that the IDF have done that to the best of their ability.”\nPerhaps, like Roberts, Churchill would also have seen a commonality between the enemy he defeated and that which Israel faces.\n“The overlap between Hamas ideology and Nazi ideology is so well colored in on the Venn diagram”\n“The overlap between Hamas ideology and Nazi ideology is so well colored in on the Venn diagram,” Roberts says.\nOf course, he adds, it is always “difficult and dangerous” to draw direct historical analogies. Hamas’s murderous rampage cannot be compared with the industrial-scale killing carried out by the Nazis, even if the former wore GoPro cameras and broadcast their “monstrous actions” on Facebook while the latter tried to cover up their crimes and destroy the gas chambers in 1945.\n“The analogy between Hamas and the Nazis strikes me as completely obvious one,” Roberts says. “I think you’d have to be deliberately obtuse not to see the connections.”\nThe Hamas attacks of October 7 and the ensuing conflict have confirmed Roberts’s belief that launching a war is a “profoundly immoral” act.\n“Wars are truly terrible things, which is why you shouldn’t start them,” he says, “and why you should fight them in as humanitarian a way as you can, which I think is what Israel has done.”"}

A February report by the Community Security Trust (CST), a nonprofit that monitors antisemitism and provides security for UK Jews, reported 3,528 antisemitic incidents in 2024, a figure that is second only to the 4,296 incidents recorded the year before. A separate study by UK-based Campaign Against Antisemitism found that only one-third of British Jews believe they have a long-term future in the United Kingdom, and half have considered leaving Britain in the past two years due to antisemitism.\nThe report by the UK arm of StandWithUs, an international Israel-education organization, included findings from an April 2024 survey of more than 1,000 non-Jewish students across 20 universities. It found that 64% of students were unwilling to call the October 7 attack “terrorism,” and 29% said they believed it was an “understandable act of resistance.” Meanwhile, 38% of students agreed that students who publicly support Israel should “expect” abuse on campus, while just 31% clearly rejected that notion.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“[This report] is littered with examples of loud and virulent support for Hamas and Hezbollah,” noted Lord John Cryer during the public debate. “These are both proscribed as terrorist organizations, and expressing support for proscribed organizations should be met with the full force of the law.”\nThe report documented numerous incidents of harassment, intimidation, and physical threats.\nProtesters attend a march against antisemitism in London, England, December 8, 2024. (Campaign Against Antisemitism)\nA student at King’s College described how he was nearly assaulted as an event focused on dialogue and understanding was shut down by anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian students who stormed the space. “Campus security later told me it was the worst violence they had seen since the encampments last year,” the student said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA student at the University of Manchester said he spoke out after he saw other students celebrating the October 7 attacks on social media. “They responded by taking screenshots of my message and posting my full name, Instagram handle, and even my address online,” he testified. “What followed was terrifying: I received hundreds of messages, many of them threatening and abusive. I was harassed, doxxed, and publicly vilified simply for speaking out.”\nOther students said they were told, “Your people should not be alive,” and that “There is no space for Zionists on campus, not now, not ever.” One recalled how they were shouted at simply for walking past the library, while another said she needed her brother to escort her to class for fear of being attacked.\nMembers of the House of Lords expressed shock at the report’s findings.\n“Let me be clear: Denying Jewish students the right publicly to identify as Zionists, when for many Zionism is a core part of the Jewish identity, is a form of religious and cultural discrimination. It’s also probably illegal,” said Lord David Wolfson of Tredegar. “It boils down to this: a university where Jewish students are either not welcome or are made to feel that they are not welcome, is an institution which has entirely forfeited its right to call itself a university.”\nThe report concluded with a set of recommendations for universities and\npolicymakers to restore a sense of safety for Jewish students on campus.\nThese include acknowledging the link between anti-Zionism and antisemitism, clarifying universities’ responsibilities, establishing clear consequences for misbehavior, and expelling students who promote or incite hate and violence.\nThe report also recommended establishing oversight mechanisms to monitor and evaluate university responses to antisemitism, conducting thorough investigations into reported incidents of antisemitism, and engaging Jewish and Israel-supporting students in the creation of safety policies."}

The comic, called “Dry Bones,” starred a Ziggy-like character named Shuldig, a bald and bristly everyman, and his dog Doobie.\nI first read Dry Bones in Hebrew school, when it served as an American Jewish teen’s introduction to the mild kvetching and occasionally pointed political musings of an average “Anglo” Israeli — that is, an immigrant from an English-speaking country, like Kirschen.\nUp until nearly the day he died last month at 87, Kirschen kept at it, portraying such Israelis — for good and for ill — to a mostly English-speaking audience.\nA typical “Dry Bones” cartoon was sparsely drawn, with Shuldig speaking directly to the reader or chatting with Doobie. “With ten terrible plagues we were brought out of Egypt,” Shuldig says in one cartoon, to which Doobie replies, “…and the UN was not there to condemn us?”\nHe would occasionally include political figures, like a more recent panel featuring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu walking a tightrope between “Public Outcry” and “Iran.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nAs is the case with many newspaper comics, even popular ones, most individual “Dry Bones” panels were instantly forgettable. But as they kept on coming over the next 50 years, they formed an indelible visual vocabulary of Israel and Israelis. Or at least they did for me, a big fan of the comics page. On my first visit to Israel, shortly after college, I expected to run into people like the sardonic Shuldig; or the sun-tanned and playful sabras like Srulik, the kibbutznik character created by the Israeli cartoonist known as Dosh; or the hilarious stereotypes — bearded Hasids, hairy-chested taxi drivers, Tel Aviv hipsters — drawn by Michel Kichka. And in fact I did.\nKirschen was born in Brooklyn in 1938, studied art at Queens College, and, after a few years of cartooning for Playboy and other outlets, moved to Israel in 1971. At its peak, “Dry Bones” appeared in some 35 newspapers in Israel and abroad, including a number of American Jewish weeklies. In recent years, appearing in the right-leaning news site Jewish News Syndicate, they took on a sharper and more hawkish edge, lionizing Donald Trump and ridiculing Israel’s critics. But for many years, Kirschen was an equal-opportunity satirist, and the sort of Jew who takes antisemitism as a fact of life and Jewish defiance as a point of pride.\nKirschen’s cartoons included pointed political commentary and often featured his characters Shuldig and Doobie, at right. (Wikipedia; The Dry Bones Project via JTA)\nHis work extended beyond the four-panel cartoon and included a “Dry Bones” Haggadah, graphic novels and, in 2004, The Dry Bones Project, a nonprofit to combat the “lies and ugliness” of anti-Semitism through humor. (In 2006, he gave out “Shmendrik” awards to those who “have most distinguished themselves by their seemingly unwitting support of anti-Semitism.”) In 2014, he won the Bonei Zion (Builders of Zion) prize from Nefesh B’Nefesh, a group that encourages Jewish immigration to Israel.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn 1994, Kirschen found an unexpected audience when born-again Christians embraced his graphic novel “Trees… The Green Testament.” The book is a history of Israel told from the perspective of its trees, and, according to a front-page article in the Wall Street Journal, unintentionally illustrates “several biblical signs that evangelical Christians believe will presage the Second Coming. Among them: Jews will return to Israel, Israel’s hills will be planted with trees, and its barren land will bloom.”\nKirschen, something of an agnostic, was baffled by but ultimately grateful for the attention, appearing on Christian radio and television shows.\nThe Kirschen cartoon I remember best was drawn during the First Gulf War, when Israelis were issued gas masks and built air-tight “safe rooms” against the possibility of a chemical weapons attack by Saddam Hussein. Israel was targeted with missiles but ultimately spared, and Kirschen imagined a new Jewish holiday in which worshippers wear replica gas masks and have a big dinner in rooms symbolically draped in plastic sheeting. Considering the actual Jewish holidays that turn near annihilation into festive ritual — essentially, as the old joke goes, all of them — the idea was not as far-fetched as it seemed.\nKirschen’s increasingly nationalist politics were not to everyone’s liking, but until the end he captured the Israelis and American Jews who either never accepted or have grown weary of “peace” talk, are angry at the Israelis and outsiders who criticize the government and are convinced that the current war is another chapter in the existential fight for Jewish survival.\nHe expressed all of this in the wake of the Hamas onslaught of October 7, 2023, but also drew a few panels with a more wistful tone — expressing confidence that the war had united Israelis with a sense of common purpose.\nKirschen suffered a stroke earlier this year, and on his blog, his wife, the artist Sali Ariel, chronicled his health challenges and decline. With the help of a graphic designer friend, “Yaakov is keeping on occasionally doing his cartoons,” she wrote on April 14. “He feels the calling to be able to help fight for the cause of the Jewish People with his satirical cartoons.”\nHe died later that day at a hospital near his home in Kfar Saba."}

He was one of several security guards at the Re’im-area Nova music festival who saved festival-goers’ lives when the terrorists attacked.\nBraslavski, who was working while on break from the military, brought two young women to safety, was wounded in both hands and continued trying to save others, despite having the opportunity to escape, according to survivors who saw him. He was last seen in the early afternoon, several hours into the attack, helping a young woman out of a garbage container where she was hiding.\nRom Braslavski was taken captive by Hamas terrorists on October 7, 2023 from the Supernova rave (Courtesy)\n“That fits,” his father told Haaretz recently. “He’s always thinking of others. A good kid. Heart of gold.”\nThere had been no information regarding Braslavski’s fate until March 6, 2025, 517 days into his captivity, when returned hostage Sasha Troufanov said he and Braslavski had briefly been held together.\nSpeaking to the Walla news site last month, Braslavski’s mother Tami said her son was injured in his hand when he was abducted and suffers from an allergy that could cause shortness of breath.\nNimrod Cohen\nNimrod Cohen, 20, is an IDF soldier from Rehovot. He has a twin sister and an older brother.\nHis mother, Vicky, describes him as sensitive and quiet, with a huge heart.\nCohen and his tank crew were abducted as they fought Hamas terrorists who had infiltrated the Nahal Oz base.

Omer Neutra, the commander.\nThe IDF has confirmed the deaths of Dahan, Daniel and Neutra, but there have been several signs of life from Cohen.\nHe was most recently spotted in a video Hamas published March 1 of released hostage Iair Horn parting with his brother Eitan, who remains in captivity.\nNimrod Cohen was taken captive by Hamas terrorists to Gaza on October 7, 2023 (Courtesy)\nThough Cohen’s face was blurred in the video, his family recognized him by the tattoo on his forearm. In the video, Cohen could be seen walking.\nHis mother told The Times of Israel last month that a returning hostage reported seeing Cohen alive, though in poor physical and mental shape, some eight months ago.\nCohen’s father told Channel 12 in February that a recently returned hostage conveyed a message from his son: “I’m okay. Don’t worry. Love you.”\nAriel Cunio\nAriel Cunio, 27, is one of four brothers born and raised in Nir Oz. He was kidnapped along with his long-time girlfriend Arbel Yehoud — who was released on January 30 — from their home in the kibbutz.

Cunio, an electrical engineer, met his wife Sharon Aloni Cunio while acting with his brother Eitan in the 2013 film “Youth.”\nAt the Berlin Film Festival last month, the film’s director Tom Shoval debuted a new project, “A Letter to David,” in which Cunio can be seen hanging out with his best friend Yarden Bibas — released from Hamas captivity on February 1 — and Bibas’s future wife, Shiri Silberman.\nDavid Cunio was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, 2023 (Courtesy)\nCunio and his wife were kidnapped along with their 3-year-old twin daughters Yuli and Emma, Sharon’s sister Danielle Aloni and Aloni’s 5-year-old daughter Emilia, who were visiting for the holiday weekend.\nAll but David were released in the November 2023 deal.\nThere had been no sign of life from David until last month, when one of the returning hostages reported seeing him alive.\nAloni Cunio told Channel 12 at the time that “There is no way to describe how much happiness I’ve been feeling from the moment that we heard the news. It gives us renewed strength to fight until he is returned, until everybody is returned.”\nFour of the Cunios, brother Lucas (far right), Ariel Cunio, David Cunio and Eitan Cunio prior to October 7, 2023, when David and Ariel Cunio were both taken hostage to Gaza (Courtesy)\nEvyatar David\nEvyatar David, 24, is the second of three siblings from Kfar Saba.

The two met in kindergarten and served in the army together.\nOn February 22, Hamas published a propaganda video showing David and Gilboa-Dalal forced to watch as other captives were freed. The two friends, gaunt with buzzed hair, could be seen begging to be saved.\nThe video was the first public sign of life from David since his abduction.\nHis sister Yeela wrote on Instagram that the video showed Hamas “monsters” had put her brother and his friend “in the most horrifying and evil situation there could be.”\n“There is no limit to the messed-up cynicism of these monsters,” she wrote.\nEvyatar David, then 22, was kidnapped by Hamas from the Re’im-area Nova music festival on October 7, 2023.

It warned that some have been isolated for the majority of their 550 days in captivity, increasing the chances of severe psychological distress, and that many of them were likely suffering from digestive problems, prolonged dehydration and serious infections.\nFifty-eight of the 251 hostages seized during the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, onslaught remain in the clutches of Gazan terror groups. Hamas is also holding the body of a soldier killed during the 2014 Gaza war, bringing the total number of captives to 59. Of that number, 24 are thought to be alive.\nThe testimonies from hostages released during the recent ceasefire from mid-January to early March reveal proof of “severe shortages of food, water and medical care, leading to malnutrition, severe weakness and the deterioration of their health,” the forum said.\nOn top of that, they are undergoing “physical and mental torture,” it said,  including “strangulation, being tied up, being hung by the legs, burns and deliberate starvation.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nSome of the hostages are chained up, “for weeks or months at a time,” and they are all being held in tunnels underground “without natural light and air,” the report said.\nImages of those held captive in Gaza are displayed at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, on March 31, 2025. (Miriam Alster/FLASH90)\n“Captivity survivors held for long periods of time described conditions of complete isolation, with no contact with other Israelis, or knowledge of their loved ones’ conditions,” the forum said.\n“Many suffered from severe malnutrition and deteriorating health due to the lack of proper medical care. Some battled serious infections or illnesses without any access to medical care, and sometimes remained wounded, without bandages or painkillers.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsrael has received proof of life for 20 of the 24 hostages since the start of the war, the forum said, but information about their health is still lacking. Of the remaining four, it said “concerns for their safety are growing.”\nThe remaining captives are a mix of soldiers and civilian men — many of whom are treated by Hamas as soldiers because they are still within the age range eligible for IDF reserve service.\nReturned hostages have recounted experiencing “particularly severe torture” if their captors determined that they were IDF soldiers or other “key figures,” the forum said. Many of them were subjected to “prolonged isolation, sleep deprivation and frequent beatings.”\nPhysical condition of the hostages\nThe report noted that at least five of the living hostages had pre-existing health conditions, including asthma, allergies and skin diseases.\nAt least eight are suffering from physical injuries, it said, including burns, infections, and injuries to the eyes and nose.\nAll 24 are suffering from malnutrition, it said, and many have lost drastic amounts of weight.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Additional evidence suggests that some of the hostages frequently suffer from vomiting and diarrhea, symptoms that indicate severe digestive problems and a risk of dehydration.”\n“This distress is likely due to the complete lack of sanitation, poor nutrition and undrinkable water,” the report stated.\nDeclining mental health\nAll 24 of the living hostages are suffering from “serious psychological disorders,” the forum said, “including anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.”\nIt noted that, in addition to being held alone for long periods, some of the hostages were separated from family members snatched along with them on October 7.\n“Sleep deprivation, threats and constant intimidation are worsening their mental states,” the report summarized.\nPeople protest against the Israeli government and call for the immediate release of the Gaza hostages, Tel Aviv, March 22, 2025. (Gili Yaari /Flash90)\nThe report also provided an overview of the health of most of the living hostages, based on testimonies shared with their families, statements from released hostages and videos released by Hamas.\nIt noted that it only published information on individual hostages with the express permission of their families. As such, several hostages were not named in the report.\nAlon Ohel\nThe forum said Alon Ohel, who was abducted from the Nova music festival, is suffering from eye injuries, leaving him with limited vision, and a risk of losing sight in his second eye as well.

This death would be a ‘preventable death,’ meaning a death that could have been avoided through proper intervention.”\n“The date in this report leaves no room for doubt — time is running out,” the four said. “Urgent action must be taken to bring them back before it is too late.”"}

We must stop delaying and launch the decisive attack. To occupy the entire territory of the Gaza Strip, and to encourage the migration of Gazans to countries around the world.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nSmotrich and Ben Gvir’s comments, however, appeared at odds with recent statements by senior American officials.\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff arrives for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin (not in picture) in Moscow, Russia, April 25, 2025.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago / Getty Images via AFP)\nAlexander, a dual citizen who grew up in New Jersey, was serving in the IDF’s Golani Brigade at the time of his abduction. He was kidnapped from his base near the Gaza border community of Nirim, known as the White House post, during the October 7 onslaught.\nIn a statement, Hamas announced on Sunday its decision to release Alexander after recent talks with US officials and “intensified efforts to achieve a ceasefire, open border crossings, and allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the US informed it of Hamas’s intent to release Alexander “without compensation or conditions” and that the step is expected to lead to negotiations on a truce.\nNetanyahu’s government was angered by US direct talks with Hamas earlier this year that led to a Hamas offer to release Alexander and the bodies of four other hostages if Israel recommitted to a stalled ceasefire deal. Days later, however, Israel resumed the war.\nUS President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff told AP that Hamas’s goal in releasing Alexander was to restart talks on a ceasefire, the release of additional hostages and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza before Israel carries out a threatened total takeover of the territory.\nIndirect talks between Hamas and the US began five days ago, an Egyptian official and a senior Hamas official told AP, with both describing the release of Alexander as a goodwill gesture.\nAlexander will be the first male hostage soldier abducted by Hamas on October 7, 2023, to be returned to Israel by the terror group.\nOn October 7, Hamas took 19 male soldiers hostage — not all of them on duty — and seven female surveillance soldiers, the latter of whom have all since been returned to Israel (five in a deal with Hamas, one rescued alive, and the body of one recovered by troops.)\nCurrently, Hamas is holding 14 male Israeli soldiers hostage, eight of whom have been declared dead, among them the body of Lt. Hadar Goldin, who was killed in 2014.\nThe apparent pause comes as Israel has been pushing ahead with its military operations in Gaza.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Israeli Air Force struck over 50 targets in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, the military said, including cells of terror operatives and buildings used by terror groups to plan and carry out attacks.\nAdditionally, the IDF said ground forces targeted a Hamas command center, caches of weapons, and sniper positions.\nHamas authorities reported 19 killed and dozens wounded during the previous 24 hours. The toll could not immediately be verified and did not differentiate between civilians and gunmen."}

The British and German foreign ministries were not immediately available to comment.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to diplomats and a document seen by Reuters, the E3 countries may trigger a snapback by August if no substantial deal can be found by then. The window closes on October 18.\nRelations between the E3 and Iran have worsened over the last year despite sporadic meetings, against a backdrop of new sanctions imposed on Tehran over its ballistic missile program, its detention of foreign citizens and support for Russia in its war against Ukraine.\nIran, which has long denied having nuclear weapons and insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, has breached the 2015 pact’s nuclear curbs since 2019, including “dramatically” accelerating its enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% level that is weapons-grade, according to the UN nuclear watchdog."}

It wasn’t clear what the official was expecting Israel to do.\n“The ceasefire agreement with the Houthis is just a prelude, and if Israel doesn’t wake up, the ‘Deal of the Millennium’ will also be finalized without it,” the official reportedly said, adding that “We hope Israel will get on board this historic train that’s already left the station.”\nThe official’s warning of a weakening alliance between Israel and the US greatly worried the families of the hostages, said the report, as US mediators play a major role in the ongoing negotiations to reach a hostage-ceasefire deal that could potentially set their loved ones free.\nSell more oil\nRiyadh wants to build nuclear generation capacity because it seeks to diversify its economy away from oil.

Russia’s state nuclear firm Rosatom, which built a nuclear plant in Egypt, has also signed preliminary cooperation agreements with Riyadh. Other potential contenders include South Korea, which built reactors in the neighboring United Arab Emirates, and France.\nThe choice of partner will likely depend on technological offerings, financing, and geopolitical alignment, including conditions related to nuclear fuel handling.\nUranium enrichment\nA key issue is whether Washington might agree to build a uranium enrichment facility on Saudi territory, when it might do so, and whether Saudi personnel might have access to it or it would be run solely by US staff in a “black box” arrangement.\nWithout rigorous safeguards built into an agreement, Saudi Arabia, which has uranium ore reserves on its territory, could theoretically use an enrichment facility to produce highly enriched uranium, which, if purified enough, can yield fissile material for bombs.\nAnother issue is whether Riyadh would agree to make a Saudi investment in a US-based and US-owned uranium enrichment plant and to hire US companies to build Saudi nuclear reactors.\nThere are diplomatic issues too: Washington’s top regional ally Israel has repeatedly voiced opposition to the idea of a Saudi civil nuclear program."}

The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIf there is “new information being kept from us, give it to us immediately,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an advocacy group, said Wednesday.\nSome 5,600 Hamas-led terrorists killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 251 during their invasion of southern Israel on October 7, 2023. Elkana Bohbot and dozens of others were grabbed from a music festival, where more than 300 people were slaughtered.\nIsrael responded with a military offensive to destroy Hamas, topple its regime, and free the hostages.\nThe Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 50,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though the toll cannot be verified and does not differentiate between civilians and fighters.\nIsrael says it has killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.\nIsrael’s toll in the ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza and in military operations along the border with the Strip stands at 416.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraeli hostage Elkana Bohbot speaks in a Hamas propaganda video issued on March 29, 2025. (Screenshot: Telegram)\nHamas has published three videos of Elkana Bohbot in the past months which were filmed under duress. In the most recent video, from mid-April, Elkana holds a fake telephone conversation with his wife, Rivka; their son, Re’em; his mother; and his brother — pleading with them to help him get out of Gaza.\nWhile the videos were a sign of life, Bohbot knows that they don’t guarantee that her son is still alive. Hearing the government’s approval this week to expand operations in Gaza deepened her concern about the fate of her son and the other hostages. Israel is “failing so utterly” to rescue the hostages, she said.\nIsrael’s decision to freeze all humanitarian aid likely meant her son also wasn’t getting food, she said. Humanitarian aid is the primary food source for 80 percent of Palestinians in Gaza, the World Food Program said in its monthly report for April, though that figure has likely risen in the past month.\n“I just want to imagine that he’s holding on and that he’s okay for now, that’s my hope and that’s my belief right now,” she said.\nIsrael stopped allowing aid into Gaza on March 2 after the first phase of a ceasefire and hostage release deal ended, leading many organizations to warn of severe malnutrition and hunger in Gaza. Jerusalem argued that Hamas diverted much of the aid that entered during the six-week truce, but said that the 650 trucks per day were enough to feed the population for an extended period. Israel says it won’t allow food, fuel, water, or medicine into the territory until it puts in place a system giving it control over the distribution.\nThe IDF reportedly plans to transition away from wholesale distribution and warehousing of aid and to instead have international organizations and private security contractors hand out boxes of food to individual Gazan families, according to Israeli and Arab officials familiar with the matter. The UN and aid groups have rejected the proposal.\nRuhama Bohbot, mother of hostage Elkana Bohbot, has a picture of her son on display at her home in Mevaseret Zion, Israel, May 7, 2025.

Her family is still paying rent on a stall at a market in Tel Aviv, where Elkana had been planning to open a gourmet ice cream shop.\nThe family will mark Re’em’s fifth birthday next month – his second during his father’s captivity. Re’em has started saying things like “if my daddy comes home,” to which the family gently corrects him – “your daddy is coming home, just wait a little bit longer,” Bohbot said.\n“He has binoculars that he made in kindergarten, he goes out occasionally and takes a look in the binoculars to look for his father,” Bohbot said."}

The IDF, she believed, was the strongest army in the world, and the private and public bomb shelters found in most apartment buildings and around cities would offer protection if the need arose.\n“All that changed on October 7,” she told The Times of Israel during a recent interview. “Something broke in my heart. I no longer felt safe in my own country. Already before that, my husband and I were really scared about Israel’s future, especially its democracy, due to the legal revolution the [Netanyahu] government tried to do.”\nAs the magnitude of the disaster became known — thousands of Hamas-led terrorists slaughtered some 1,200 people in southern Israel and abducted 251 to the Gaza Strip in an unprecedented invasion that left the Gaza envelope in ruins — Foux and her family left their home in Kfar Saba and flew to Athens, Greece, where they lived until moving to Toronto.\nWhen they arrived last spring, they were among the estimated 5,000 Israelis who moved to Toronto in the wake of the October 7, 2023, onslaught. It was Foux’s first time in Canada.\nThe family decided on the country after hearing it had introduced a special initiative for Israelis — the Special Measures Open Work Permit initiative — which provided a legal pathway to living in Canada. Foux and her husband chose Toronto because it was already home to about 60,000 Israelis, an increasingly large segment of the area’s 200,000-strong Jewish community.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nIn 2024, according to Canadian government figures, nearly 11,000 Israelis received either work permits under a special program or regular temporary residence status. The number of Israelis applying for temporary residence (often a step toward permanent residence or official immigration) more than tripled in 2024 compared to the previous year, from 3,153 to 9,753. Toronto was the most popular destination, by far.\nMost Israeli newcomers do not seem overly concerned by the drastic rise in antisemitism in Canada since October 7. Newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney, has — much to the consternation of many Canadian Jews — said little about the problem.\nIt is an issue for Jews in Toronto, where the police just released sobering new statistics, showing that reported hate crimes increased 19 percent in 2024 compared to 2023, of which Jews were the leading target (40%), despite representing less than 4% of the city’s population. Likewise, a lengthy recent Israeli Diaspora Ministry report stated, “In 2024, Canada earned the dubious distinction as ‘champion of antisemitism.’”\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, for many Israeli transplants, the embrace of the Toronto Jewish community has more than made up for any yet-to-be experienced hate crimes.\n“Toronto’s Jewish community has been amazing, like one big welcoming family,” says Foux, who worked as a schoolteacher and tour guide in Israel. “They made our landing much smoother.”\nRotem Foux. (Courtesy)\nIsraeli newcomers are a top priority for the Prosserman JCC and Schwartz/Reisman Centre.\n“Since October 7, we’ve welcomed a significant influx of Israeli families seeking stability and connection in Toronto,” says Prosserman JCC and Schwartz/Reisman Centre CEO Andrew Levy. “We’ve responded by creating programs, services, and a warm, supportive community where they can rebuild and find a sense of belonging.”\nLike other immigrants to Canada, Israeli newcomers face many challenges, including housing, employment, schools for children, administrative and bureaucratic requirements, language and cultural differences, and the fabled Canadian winter.\nThey receive help from various Jewish agencies, whose funding comes largely from the UJA Federation of Greater Toronto, the city’s main Jewish community organization.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPresident and CEO of the UJA Federation of Greater Toronto Adam Minsky. (Courtesy)\n“After October 7, we quickly identified two segments of Israelis who were especially vulnerable in Greater Toronto,” says Adam Minsky, UJA President and CEO. “The first were those visiting Toronto [during the High Holidays] when the war began, and couldn’t return to Israel due to travel restrictions and limited flights, or they lived in the affected war zone, or other reasons. The second were Israelis who came to Canada after the war began, seeking short-term or longer-term respite from the trauma and crisis that were unfolding there.”\nHot before it was cool\nWell before October 7, some Israelis already had their eyes on Canada.\n“For a long time, moving here was on my mind,” says Elad Shtamer, 40, a dance and music teacher and computer programming tutor. “After the birth of my daughter in 2020, the idea became more present in my life. Then, when the Canadian government made it easier for Israelis to get work permits after October 7, it became more real.”\nAt the time, he, his wife, and their daughter were living in Tzlafon, an agriculture cooperative 35 kilometers (roughly 22 miles) east of Ashdod. Subsequent events ultimately led them to move to Toronto last June, where they welcomed their second child a few months later.\n“What influenced us was the ongoing war over our heads,” adds Shtamer. “We lived in a village where we could hear the bombings of both Hamas and the IDF and we needed some peace and quiet, especially for our daughter.”\nElad Shtamer. (Courtesy)\nMany Israelis moving to Toronto contact JIAS (Jewish Immigrant Aid Services), some even before arriving. It provides useful information and orientation sessions, assistance navigating Canadian bureaucracy, connections with Jewish community bodies, housing and social and professional opportunities, mental health/well-being programs, and language support.\nAs manager of community engagement at JIAS, Jodi Block works with Israeli newcomers. She helps with housing needs and oversees the 150 volunteers from the community who have assisted Israelis post-October 7.\n“The work we did with Ukrainians arriving in Toronto following the Russian invasion in 2022 made us better prepared for the arrival of Israelis over the past 19 months,” says Block, who has worked at JIAS since 2004. “We formalized a kind of crisis handbook as a turn-key response plan, which provided a framework for our response starting October 7.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nShe does not pass judgment on those who leave Israel.\n“Mobility is part of 21st-century life and people choose where to live for different reasons,” adds Block.\nThere to stay\nElinor Aichenblatt and her family arrived in Toronto last May. On October 7, she, her husband and two young daughters were living in Sderot, where Hamas terrorists killed dozens of people that day.\n“It was horrible,” says Aichenblatt, 40, who was then five months pregnant. “It really felt like the Holocaust. We locked ourselves in our bomb shelter, knowing we had to be quiet, which was nearly impossible with small children. We really feared for our lives.”\nElinor Aichenblatt. (Courtesy)\nThe next day, while Hamas terrorists were still in the area, Elinor and her family fled north to the center of the country, moving several times before settling in Kfar Saba.\n“It was extremely difficult,” adds Aichenblatt. “We had to show our daughters everything was okay. I had to function while I was completely broken, physically and mentally. I couldn’t breathe anymore. The pressure and sense of insecurity overwhelmed me. There was a feeling of mourning, fear, and sadness. I knew people who were murdered, kidnapped, and died during the war.”\nAfter her husband learned of Canada’s special visa program for Israelis, he told Aichenblatt about it.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“At first, I thought he was crazy,” she says. “We had already gone through so much and now again to move, and to another continent? But deep down, I wanted it. I felt it would be the right step for me and my family.”\nBoth Aichenblatt, who worked as a nurse in Israel and has a background in IT and medical products sales, and her husband, an architect and software engineering manager, still seek employment. Nevertheless, she has no regrets about the move.\n“I needed it,” says Aichenblatt. “I’m breathing again. It’s so quiet and peaceful here, stress-free and beautiful. It’s what I need these days.”\nWhen asked if she would consider moving back to Israel if the war in Gaza ended and the border with Lebanon stayed quiet, she’s definitive.\n“No way!” Aichenblatt insists. “We lost faith and trust in the notion of peace. And after settling down in a different country with our kids, we’re not leaving at this stage. That’s probably the case for most Israelis who’ve moved here since October 7.”\nThe surge in interest in Toronto from Israelis has led to grassroots initiatives and commercial services offering assistance to newcomers and those exploring such a move.\nMichal Harel and her husband Avital Epstein show the website they set up to help Israelis navigate a move to Canada in Oakville, Ontario, Canada, December 4, 2024.

We found ourselves talking on the phone for hours every day, explaining Canadian immigration rules and life here. Eventually, realizing we couldn’t keep talking on the phone all day, we built a website about moving to Canada.”\nSince its inception, the Hebrew website, which includes guidance on Canadian bureaucracy, immigration regulations, employment, health and community life and recommends immigration consultants and realtors, has had more than 100,000 visitors, of which 5,000 have either emailed or phoned Ovrim to Canada. Every day, the non-profit receives queries from Israeli families and individuals of all ages and socioeconomic levels.\nA Hebrew language Rosh Hashanah event at the Schwartz/Reisman Centre in Toronto, October 2024.

His real estate agency and his website Canada Soft Landing mainly find rental housing for Israelis and give advice on employment, where to live, schooling for children, opening a bank account, obtaining a Canadian driving license and connecting with Jewish community support agencies. As he is paid by landlords for finding new tenants, Adivi does not charge newcomers for his services.\nStav Adivi. (Courtesy)\nMost Israelis contact Adivi before arriving, finding his Hebrew-language website via Facebook, Google or word-of-mouth. Over the past year, he has averaged 10 to 15 emails or phone calls from Israelis every week, significantly more than before October 7. Adivi, a Toronto resident since 2006, following three years in the US after leaving Israel, expects the numbers to rise before the special visa program ends on July 31.\nToronto has particular appeal.\n“The majority come to the Toronto area because its large population provides a strong economy and better job market, and also due to Jewish community support and networking with other Israelis for social and professional needs,” says Adivi. “Many, if not most, Israelis like to be near other Israelis as consolation for leaving behind family and friends back home.”\nLess of a stigma\nFormer Jerusalemite Galya Sarner (full disclosure: Sarner is married to this article’s author) has long worked closely with Israelis in Toronto.\n“It’s sad to see how many Israelis have left Israel since October 7 and moved to Toronto,” says Sarner, who, as director of Israel engagement at the Prosserman JCC and Schwartz/Reisman Centre, oversees events and projects to integrate newcomers into the community. “They may now be far from Israel, but you can’t take Israel away from them. They’re incredible ambassadors for Israel, bringing the Israeli flavor and culture at its best.”\nIsraelis attend a Hebrew language Rosh Hashanah event at the Schwartz/Reisman Centre in Toronto, October 2024. (Courtesy)\nToday, expatriate Israelis face less stigma back home than in the past.\n“My family and friends were all supportive of my decision, even my parents,” says Aichenblatt. “They understood and encouraged me to take that step. They knew how hard it was for me in Israel after October 7.”\nFoux faced a much more mixed response.\n“My family was very supportive, much more so than some of my friends,” she says. “Initially, after we first moved to Greece on October 7, most of my friends were really encouraging and told me I was doing the right thing. But once we decided to stay on there [before moving to Toronto], some friends dramatically changed their attitude, saying all Israelis need to stay in Israel. I felt a lot of hostility from some of them.”\nGusti Yehoshua-Braverman, who heads the Jerusalem-based World Zionist Organization’s department focusing on Israelis overseas, participated in a recent WZO conference in Florida of representatives of Israeli communities in North America.\nFor Yehoshua-Braverman, the priority is reinforcing the connection between expatriate Israelis and their homeland and ensuring Israel always has open arms for them.\n“No one knows how long these Israelis will live outside Israel,” says Yehoshua-Braverman. “Some will stay for a lifetime. Others will return. One thing I know for sure from our experience, and I say this representing a national, Zionist institution, is that being a Zionist doesn’t necessarily mean living in Israel. What’s important is to keep the bond between Israelis living abroad and the state of Israel, and to keep them rooted in Judaism and the Hebrew language.”"}

A passerby with a flannel shirt tied around her waist snapped a furtive photo of the woman, and a man began to tail her from the opposite side of the street, noting the precise time and location of her stops and movements.\nAn hour later, all three were debriefing in a nearby conference room. The woman in black was a trainer for the Community Security Service, a nonprofit that trains volunteer synagogue guards throughout the US, and the two surveilling her were participants in a training program. The exercise was part of a three-day course for 10 CSS volunteers at the organization’s new facility in Westchester County.\nThe facility, the first in the US dedicated to training synagogue guards, is part of the group’s expanding efforts to protect Jewish institutions, as American Jews build out an array of connected security measures amid a global surge in antisemitism.\nCSS granted The Times of Israel exclusive access to the training facility on the condition that it not divulge the building’s location, volunteers’ identities, or certain details of the group’s protocols, due to security concerns.\nCSS was established as a non-profit by several congregants at a New York City synagogue in 2007.

At the start of the training, the group watched a short documentary on a deadly shooting at a Jewish school in Toulouse, France.\n“We never thought that in the United States people would start feeling that way as well. We always thought that this is something that happens in Europe, in the Middle East, but there are two places where Jews are safe. One is Israel,” Priem told the guards at the start of the training. “The other was the United States, and we’ve seen now that’s no longer the case.”\nFlowers surround Stars of David in a makeshift memorial outside the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on October 31, 2018, four days after a gunman killed 11 people attending services there. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File)\nSecurity efforts for US Jews gained steam after the Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh in 2018. More deadly attacks on Jews followed, in Poway, California; Jersey City, New Jersey; and Monsey, New York. The October 2023 Hamas assault on Israel and ensuing wave of antisemitism was another shock to US Jews.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCSS expanded as those fears grew, and now counts around 5,000 active volunteers in 25 states. In the past five years, CSS’s staff has grown from two to 20.\nOne of the guards at the course, a woman in her 50s from New York, started with CSS eight years ago. She saw attitudes toward security start to change with the Tree of Life shooting.\n“That really brought it home. It could happen to any synagogue, any school,” she said. “When I first started, people didn’t take it as seriously. ‘Why do we have to do this? Why do you have to check my bag?’ It was a pain. Over the years, people are used to it and they appreciate it.”\nCSS trained local leaders on an ad hoc basis, using a one-on-one mentoring model in their communities. Those local leaders would then pass the training on to rank-and-file volunteers.\nAs the group grew, its leadership realized it needed a more formal training system, an established curriculum, and a central location to bring together volunteers from around the US for more advanced training. In 2022, CSS started hosting annual retreats. The first year, 50 volunteers showed up. Last year’s retreat in Pennsylvania brought in more than 200 applicants, but could only accommodate 75 trainees.\nThe training facility located in CSS’s headquarters, is the next step in building the group’s infrastructure. CSS opened the headquarters, housed in a nondescript office building, in December to streamline its operations and bring in groups of volunteers from around the US year-round to train as synagogue guards.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSecurity personnel search peoples’ bags and clothes as they arrive for an interfaith service at Park East Synagogue in New York, Wednesday, October 31, 2018. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\nThe participants are expected to bring those lessons back to their local communities, where a vast majority of the training still takes place. CSS held around 700 training sessions throughout the US last year, Priem said.\nThe synagogue guards, who work with local law enforcement and often volunteer alongside paid armed guards hired by individual synagogues or provided by local federations, are meant to be part of an interlocking system of Jewish security organizations that has developed over the years.\nThe array includes the Secure Community Network and the Community Security Initiative, which collect intelligence, with CSI focusing on the New York region.\nThe Anti-Defamation League does research and advocacy. Groups such as Guardian Self Defense teach Krav Maga. The organizations collaborate with each other and with law enforcement. CSS volunteers train in Krav Maga with Guardian Self Defense, and the group receives threat alerts from other partners, for example.\nThe cohort last week was the fourth group to train at the facility.

(Luke Tress/Times of Israel)\nLocal volunteer leaders identify rank-and-file members from their community with leadership potential and refer them for the advanced training. During the three-day course, the trainees learn security skills and how to lead security teams in their communities.\nThe guards train in surveillance, questioning, intelligence, decision-making, security planning, and Krav Maga, both at the office and at synagogues in the community that lend space to CSS.\nSix men and four women attended the training session. The volunteers came from New York, Florida, California and Massachusetts. They included a college student, a retired lawyer, a Coast Guard veteran and an ex-fireman, ranging in age from their mid-20s into their 60s. Some were secular and others were Orthodox.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMost were there to learn how to guard their local synagogue, though a few of the younger volunteers were there as part of a separate CSS group, called ROAM, which dispatches young professionals to secure Jewish community events in the tri-state area.\nThe trainers included a veteran of an Israeli infantry unit with around 15 years of post-army experience securing Israeli diplomats and consulates, and Chuck Berkowitz, a former senior detective for the New York City Police Department.\nOne of the trainees, a woman in her 20s from New York, said she had joined ROAM after looking for community security programs following October 7.\n“It feels like I’m making a tangible difference,” she said. “You can go to bed knowing that there was a Jewish event that did not get blown up, that was protected, was safe.”\n“That’s felt more constructive for me than getting stuck in my head, thinking how much the world hates us. You can do something,” she added.\nCSS volunteers practice security questioning at a synagogue in Westchester County, New York, April 28, 2025. (Luke Tress/Times of Israel)\nAt the start, the group trained in “red teaming” — getting in the head of a bad actor to probe their own vulnerabilities.\n“We’re going to think like an attacker. We’re going to try to put ourselves in their shoes, in terms of operational planning, so we can deter and detect and disrupt them,” one of the trainers said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe street surveillance drill was not meant to train the guards in doing surveillance, but to teach them how it feels to do “hostile reconnaissance” in a live environment, the kind of surveillance a would-be attacker might perform while on a synagogue. The experience is meant to help the trainees identify bad actors carrying out surveillance, the instructors said.\nEach group was assigned a target — one of the trainers — and instructed to observe them without being caught, take notes about their movements, and look for patterns. Berkowitz led the drill, which was coordinated with local law enforcement.\nIn the next exercise, a CSS intelligence staffer trained the group in open-source intelligence techniques. Trainees were made aware of their own online exposure and vulnerabilities.\nThe guards also practiced questioning, with some volunteers role-playing while others questioned them. The drill trained the guards to identify suspicious behaviors, to learn access control and effective screening.\nA CSS volunteer prepares for a mock attack on his colleagues during a training session at a synagogue in Westchester County, New York, April 28, 2025. (Luke Tress/Times of Israel)\nThe guards left the facility to train emergency responses at a local synagogue. The trainers separated them into two groups — one charged with protecting the synagogue, and the other role-playing as bystanders or attackers. The trainers laid out a scenario for that group to surprise the guards. The instructor repeatedly told the guards to act with urgency, to practice going “from zero to 100 in a split second.”\n“I need you to take control of a situation,” he said. “It’s a mental change you need to work on.”\n“Every time I go on shift, I’m thinking, ‘Today something is going to happen,'” Priem told the group.\nIn one scenario, the guards questioned the role-playing community members as they lined up at the synagogue door. One of the entrants told a guard, “I saw something weird by the bushes,” where the trainers had stashed a fake explosive wrapped in cloth. The guard told his associates via radio that he was going to check. After he left his post, a shooter with a fake gun emerged from behind a cherry blossom tree bursting with pink flowers, opened fire, then retreated. Two people dropped to the ground, wounded.\n“Lockdown, lockdown. Active shooter,” the guard said into his radio. Another guard slammed the synagogue door shut.\nAfter the exercise, the instructors debriefed the participants, giving them pointers on how they could have responded more effectively.\nA downed “attacker” during a CSS security drill at a synagogue in Westchester County, New York, April 28, 2025. (Luke Tress/Times of Israel)\nAntisemitism has spiked in the US and internationally in recent years, and in the US, authorities have foiled repeated attack attempts on Jewish communities.\nIn the past year, authorities arrested a suspect who threatened a New York synagogue, after receiving a tip from the Community Security Initiative; detained an armed man in Florida for planning an attack on the American Israel Public Affairs Committee; arrested a college student who planned a terror attack on the Israeli consulate in New York City; detained a suspect in Canada who was attempting to enter the US to attack a Jewish center in Brooklyn; and indicted a neo-Nazi for planning to distribute poisoned candy to children at Jewish schools in New York.\nCSS and other security groups have proven their worth in recent years. In 2022, a CSS volunteer noticed a threat on social media and sent the information to CSI, which sent the threat to law enforcement. Police arrested a pair of suspects armed with a knife, a handgun and a Nazi armband.\nA year earlier, volunteers in the Bronx pursued and snapped a photo of a suspect who had carried out a string of vandalism against Jewish institutions in the area, leading to his arrest. In 2023, in Washington, DC, volunteer guards blocked an assailant who attempted to attack congregants with a foul-smelling spray outside a synagogue while shouting “Gas the Jews.”\nPolice officers stand watch outside the United Synagogue of Hoboken, New Jersey, Thursday, November 3, 2022, after the FBI warned of a ‘broad threat’ to Jewish places of worship in the state. (AP/Ryan Kryska)\nIn other incidents, volunteers have screened out protesters from attending Jewish events, preventing disruptions and allowing the events to go forward.\nPriem said volunteers have reported around 200-300 suspicious incidents a year in recent years. Around half of those incidents are referred to law enforcement for investigation.\nSynagogues use volunteers because hiring security is expensive, and some government security grants that are already onerous to obtain offer only limited funding for guards. CSS also says that volunteers are familiar with their synagogue’s members and culture, so are better able to spot outsiders or suspicious behaviors. In some states, strict laws regulate police interactions with the public, such as prohibitions on any kind of profiling, rules that do not apply to volunteers.\nAccording to Priem, another benefit to using volunteers is that they will be able to continue their work on their own should funding dry up altogether.\n“My feeling, especially the time that we live right now, I feel that I am part of a big family and I’m protecting that family,” said a volunteer who does up to six shifts a week at his New York synagogue. “There is a feeling of belonging and giving back to the community.”"}

The sanctuary, which is managed by Augustinian friars, has been a place of pilgrimage since the 15th century, and Leo visited it last year.\nThe after-lunch outing came after Leo presided over his first formal audience, with the cardinals who elected him pope. In it, Leo repeatedly cited Francis and the Argentine pope’s own 2013 mission statement, making clear a commitment to making the Catholic Church more inclusive and attentive to the faithful and a church that looks out for the “least and rejected.”\nLeo, the first American pope, told the cardinals that he was fully committed to the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, the 1960s meetings that modernized the church. He identified AI as one of the main issues facing humanity, saying it poses challenges to defending human dignity, justice and labor.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nIdentifying with Pope Francis\nLeo referred to AI in explaining the choice of his name: His namesake, Pope Leo XIII, was pope from 1878 to 1903 and laid the foundation for modern Catholic social thought. He did so most famously with his 1891 encyclical Rerum Novarum, which addressed workers’ rights and capitalism at the dawn of the industrial age. The late pope criticized both laissez-faire capitalism and state-centric socialism, giving shape to a distinctly Catholic vein of economic teaching.\nPope Leo XIV, left, is flanked by Monsignor Leonardo Sapienza, second from left, after his meeting with the College of Cardinals in the New Synod Hall at the Vatican, Saturday, May 10, 2025. (Vatican Media via AP)\nIn his remarks Saturday, Leo said he identified with his predecessor, who addressed the great social question of the day posed by the industrial revolution in the encyclical.\n“In our own day, the church offers everyone the treasury of its social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defense of human dignity, justice and labor,” he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nToward the end of his pontificate, Francis became increasingly vocal about the threats to humanity posed by AI and called for an international treaty to regulate it. He warned that such powerful technology risks turning human relations into mere algorithms. Francis brought his message to the Group of Seven industrialized nations when he addressed their summit last year, insisting AI must remain human-centric so that decisions about when to use weapons or even less lethal tools always remain made by humans and not machines.\nThe late Argentine pope also used his 2024 annual peace message to call for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, arguing that a technology lacking human values of compassion, mercy, morality and forgiveness is too perilous to develop unchecked.\nPope Leo XIV meets the College of Cardinals in the New Synod Hall at the Vatican, Saturday, May 10, 2025. (Vatican Media via AP)\nFrancis favored the Chicago-born Augustinian missionary Robert Prevost. He moved him to take over a small Peruvian diocese in 2014, where Prevost later became bishop and head of the Peruvian bishops conference, and then called him to Rome to take over one of the most important Vatican offices vetting bishop nominations in 2023.\nThe Vatican revealed Saturday that Leo would retain the motto and coat of arms that he had as bishop of Chiclayo, Peru. The motto, “In Illo uno unum,” was pronounced by St. Augustine in a sermon to explain that “although we Christians are many, in the one Christ we are one.”\nIn the speech, delivered in Italian in the Vatican’s synod hall – not the Apostolic Palace – Leo made repeated references to Francis and the mourning over his death. He held up Francis’s 2013 mission statement, “The Joy of the Gospel,” as something of his own marching orders.\nHe cited Francis’s insistence on the missionary nature of the church and the need to make its leadership more collegial. He cited the need to pay attention to what the faithful say, “especially in its most authentic and inclusive forms, especially popular piety.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nAgain, referring to Francis’s 2013 mission statement, Leo cited the need for the church to express “loving care for the least and rejected” and engage in courageous dialogue with the contemporary world.\nA quick conclave\nGreeted by a standing ovation, Leo read from his prepared text, only looking up occasionally. Even when he first appeared to the world on Thursday night, Leo read from a prepared, handwritten text that he must have drafted sometime before his historic election or the hour or so after. He seemed most comfortable speaking off-the-cuff in the few words he pronounced in Spanish.\nPope Leo XIV meets the College of Cardinals in the New Synod Hall at the Vatican, Saturday, May 10, 2025. (Vatican Media via AP)\nPrevost was elected the 267th pontiff on Thursday on the fourth ballot of the conclave, an exceptionally fast outcome given this was the largest and most geographically diverse conclave in history and not all cardinals knew one another before arriving in Rome.\nCardinals have said Prevost did not make any major speech during the pre-conclave discussions, and he carried into the conclave the traditional taboo precluding a pope from the United States, given America’s superpower status. But Prevost was already known to many.\nThey said he made an impression in smaller groups where English was the key language of communication in a conclave that brought together 133 cardinals from 70 countries.\nMadagascar Cardinal Désiré Tsarahazana told reporters on Saturday that on the final ballot, Prevost had received “more” than 100 votes. That suggests an extraordinary margin, well beyond the two-thirds, or 89 votes, necessary to be elected.\nA comment from a contender\nCardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state who had been considered one of the top contenders to be pope, offered his congratulations on Saturday in a letter published in his hometown paper, Il Giornale di Vicenza.\nParolin praised Leo’s grasp of today’s problems, recalling his first words from the loggia when he spoke of the need for a peace that is “disarmed and disarming.” Parolin said he had appreciated Prevost’s leadership in Chiclayo, saying he helped handle a particularly thorny problem — with no details — and grew to appreciate his governance more closely at the Vatican, handling the bishops’ office.\nSpecifically, Parolin praised Leo’s understanding of people and situations, his “calmness in argumentation, balance in proposing solutions, respect, care and love for everyone.”"}

That act raised eyebrows at the Vatican and was denounced by former Italian premier Romano Prodi as indecent political interference in matters of faith.\nAnd last month, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops announced the end of a half-century of partnerships with the federal US government to serve refugees and migrant children, saying the “heartbreaking” decision followed the Trump administration’s abrupt halt to funding.\nThe majority of Leo’s posts on the X platform are related to or in support of Catholic news and church initiatives.

Is your conscience not disturbed? How can you stay quiet?”\nLeo’s critiques of Trump date back nearly a decade.\nWhen Trump’s first presidential campaign ramped up in July 2015, he posted to X a Washington Post op-ed by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, with the headline, “Why Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric is so problematic.”\nIn the wake of Trump’s first election in 2016, Leo reposted a homily in which Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez — characterizing the fear among many, including schoolchildren who “think the government is going to come and deport their parents, any day now” — said that America is “better than this.”\nDays later, Leo also posted an article by a Catholic outlet quoting Democrats as saying that, in her loss, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton “ignored pro-lifers at her own peril.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nPope Francis elevates to cardinal the US prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops Robert Francis Prevost during a consistory to create 21 new cardinals at St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican on September 30, 2023.

But along with the National Endowment for the Humanities, which supports research in the humanities, it has long been a target for conservatives who believe the government should not support arts endeavors, particularly ones that they say advance progressive values. The Trump administration, which has taken a slash-and-burn approach to spending and sought to cut off many recipients of federal funding for ideological reasons, on Friday proposed eliminating the National Endowment of the Arts entirely.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“The NEA is updating its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation’s rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the President,” an email from the NEA to at least some grant recipients sent Friday night after the budget proposal. “Consequently, we are terminating awards that fall outside these new priorities.”\nThe rescissions leave Jewish and other groups uncertain about how they will cover their expenses. Some have already budgeted for or even spent the latest grants, anticipating receiving the awards they had been promised.\nWinitsky said he saw the cuts as a direct attack on groups that might undercut the administration.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“This is enormously concerning,” he said. “It may feel like a small amount of money — $207 million for the United States government is a tiny amount of money, and it is one of many chaotic policies that are being rolled out right now.

The NEA email received by grantees said the administration would continue to support “projects that elevate the Nation’s HBCUs and Hispanic Serving Institutions, celebrate the 250th anniversary of American independence, foster AI competency, empower houses of worship to serve communities, assist with disaster recovery, foster skilled trade jobs, make America healthy again, support the military and veterans, support Tribal communities, make the District of Columbia safe and beautiful, and support the economic development of Asian American communities.”\nAnything else would be cut off, the email said, adding that grantees could appeal within seven days “if [they] believe [their] project meets one of the agency’s new priorities.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nWinitsky said he thinks the Jewish Plays Project will appeal the decision. But he said the new funding priorities set forth in the email were confusing and “don’t really add up to a cohesive strategy at all,” and he emphasized that his initiative would not be swayed in its mission.\n“If somebody asks us to change what we are doing to meet somebody else’s priorities or somebody else’s vision, we’re not going to do that,” Winitsky said.\nFor Yugntruf, the initial $10,000 grant marked the first government funding received for its work. The grant was intended to support the publication of “Hanka: The Ghetto Queen Sings at Night,” a bilingual English-Yiddish edition of Jacob Pat’s children’s book “Haneke,” the true story of a teenager imprisoned in the Bialystok Ghetto during the Holocaust who became the youngest member of the city’s underground resistance movement.\nThe grant was meant to go to various freelancers in support of production costs for the book’s layout and design, archival research, a cartographer and editing. Jacob Pat’s great-granddaughter, Anita Galler, is the English translator.\n“It’ll be harder, but we’ll publish it,” said Jordan Kutzik, Yugntruf’s chair. “We’ll make up the money. We’re in a better position than a lot of other organizations who’ve had this funding cut.”\nKutzik said he did not see the NEA grants as “targeting any particular demographic” but said they did not make sense to him.\n“It’s odd to see them saying a Yiddish-English children’s book about the Holocaust doesn’t reflect the American artistic culture,” he said. “The Holocaust is part of the American story, because a million Americans are descendants of Holocaust survivors. The author we’re publishing was a refugee from the Holocaust who wrote this book for an American audience.”\nAdditionally, funding for the City Parks Foundation, which operates SummerStage, the annual public summer festival held in Central Park that features a lineup of Yiddish music, was rescinded. This year’s “New York Sings Yiddish” show, scheduled for June 30, includes performances from conductor and artistic director of the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene Zalmen Mlotek and Frank London’s Klezmer All Stars. The City Parks Foundation did not respond to a request for comment about the potential impact on the concert series."}

My family military tree can be easily traced back to World War I, and my great uncle fought in the infantry against the invading Germans in 1940, while my paternal grandfather was the personal driver of the commander in chief of the French army, Gen. Maurice Gamelin.\nI grew up listening to their stories and perhaps this is why ever since I became a war photographer, I didn’t just want to photograph wars, but also the veterans who had fought in previous ones. It is within this context that, one day in 2004, I had the idea to photograph World War II veterans and collect their testimonies. In this way, I could create a piece which, in time, would provide real historical value to future generations.\nThe first subject of this photo project came along randomly while I was living in Santa Barbara, California, and beginning my career shooting for local newspapers. I met a friend’s grandfather who had fought as a pilot in the Pacific, and I asked to photograph and interview him about his experiences. And just like that, a photography project that would take me around the world for over 10 years was born.\nWithin six months, I had met and photographed veterans of over 15 nationalities, including many Red Army veterans of Jewish descent who had fought on the Eastern Front. Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, all with unique stories of survival and resilience.\nThis portrait series honors the enduring spirit of WWII veterans, capturing their strength, sacrifice, and humanity eight decades after the war’s end.  As we mark the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, these images are a powerful reminder of the individuals, now deceased, who stood for freedom in one of the world’s darkest times.

Rozenberg fought with the Red Army against the invading Germans and Axis allies. (Jonathan Alpeyrie)\n“It purely was by accident that I met my father on the front line during heavy fighting near Warsaw in early 1945. I could not believe my eyes, and quickly embraced him.”\nLeonid Rozenberg was born in 1921 in Izwaslavl, Ukraine. Rozenberg graduated from high school in 1939 and served in the military as a lieutenant in Kiev. He was sent to western Belarussia as part of the 20th division and was wounded by German machine guns. He escaped and returned to the North Caucasian front, where he was promoted to artillery company leader.\nHe fought at the Battle of Rostov and Bielgorod, and took part in the liberation of Kiev in November 1943. Rozenberg later participated in the liberation of Ukraine, Poland, and Germany. He fought in the liberation of Warsaw in early 1945 and received a medal during the Battle of Boevogo-Krasnogo-Znameni. In 1945, Rozenberg met his father, who was later killed by German troops for being Jewish, near the Warsaw front. He fought in the Battle of Berlin in 1945 and was subsequently promoted to major. He remained in Germany until 1950 before returning to Moscow, where he served in the Red Army until 1968.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAlexander Turetsky, Russia\nAlexander Turetsky poses near the Russian World War II Association in Brighton Beach, New York, circa 2005-2015. Turetsky fought with the Red Army against the invading Germans and Axis allies. (Jonathan Alpeyrie)\n“My company was used for reconnaissance. My commanding officer would often send us to the German front lines to try to capture a German soldier and collect information. It was a very dangerous type of mission, but necessary for our victory.”\nBorn in Moscow in 1924, Alexander Turetsky grew up in the capital and completed his education there. He graduated from an officers’ training course as a lieutenant in 1942, still not even 18 years old.\nHe saw heavy action in Leningrad during a German advance and was wounded while looking for a position in which his soldiers could take cover. He served with the 344th Roslavskaya division from January 1942 to January 1945, again seeing action in a village near Moscow as the leader of a company of about 100 men. His unit was often used as a reconnaissance outfit looking for Germans to capture and bring back for questioning.\nHe fought during the entire campaign of Belarussia, as well as in a fierce battle in Smolensk, Russia, where he fought on the outskirts of the city. He also saw heavy action in 1944 during Operation Bagration, which shattered the German front lines and marked the largest defeat in German military history. Turetsky was sent back to military school from January to May 1945 and missed the end of the war. He then returned to military school and retired in 1967 as the commander of a regiment with the rank of colonel.\nJosef Krulyak, Russia\nJosef Krulyak poses near the Russian World War II Association in Brighton Beach, New York, circa 2005-2015. Krulyak fought with the Red Army as a Belarussian against the invading Germans and Axis allies. (Jonathan Alpeyrie)\n“It was never really peaceful on the Black Sea. The Germans often attacked us with their dive bombers, dropping bombs on the decks of our ships. I did my best to shoot them down with our guns, but they were like flies hovering over our positions.”\nBorn on April 18, 1927, Josef Krulyak grew up in Rzhev, Russia. After the war began in June 1941, he and his parents left their hometown to escape the Germans. They worked in a collective farm and later moved to Marmysah, where they worked in stables. Krulyak was drafted in 1944 at just 17 and trained in the Russian navy. He served on the Krasnyikrym destroyer as part of an anti-aircraft cannon crew and first saw action in April of 1944 as part of the Black Sea fleet, fighting against the retreating Axis forces, mostly against attacking German aircraft.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDuring a night shift, Krulyak spotted an object moving in the water that turned out to be a floating mine and reported it to his captain, saving many lives. He participated in small battles inside the city and remained in the eastern Black Sea until the war ended. After the war, the crew remained in Georgia, where it was active until 1951.\nSalomon Freidlyand, Belarussia\nSalomon Freidlyand poses near the Russian World War II Association in Brighton Beach, New York, circa 2005-2015. Freidlyand fought with the Red Army as a Belarussian against the invading Germans and Axis allies. (Jonathan Alpeyrie)\n“I was better-educated than most of the men in the division. My commander asked for volunteers to join a chemical unit. I agreed.”\nBorn in Orsha, Belarussia, in 1921, Salomon Freidlyand moved to Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) in 1925 and studied there between 1929 and 1939. He was drafted into the Red Army in 1939 and trained at Alexandria. He was sent to western Ukraine and became the leader of a 45-millimeter artillery battery.\nWhen the Germans invaded, he was stationed in Slavyansk, where they fought against the advancing German army. Freidlyand was transferred to the 297th division and later to a special chemical division. He graduated from a military training course in February 1942 and became a lieutenant, working with partisans and local spies to gather information on German troops in the area. He was wounded during the Battle of Stalingrad and was sent back to Leningrad. He moved to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, but was unable to find work, and eventually moved to Andijan, where he worked for the government until the end of the war.\nIsrael Barsuk, Ukraine\nIsrael Barsuk poses in his Brighton Beach, New York, apartment, circa 2005-2015. Barsuk fought for the Red Army against the invading Germans and Axis allies. (Jonathan Alpeyrie)\n“My commander was killed in front of me by a German sniper. One moment he was giving orders, a moment later he was no more, face down with a bullet in his head.”\nBorn in Kremnchuk, Ukraine, in 1919, Israel Barsuk was drafted into the army and sent to Komsomolsk-na-amor in Eastern Russia as part of the 220th division in 1939. As Germany invaded in June of 1941, Barsuk was sent back to his division on the southwest front of Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine. He was badly injured during heavy action against German troops and spent four months in a hospital in Ossetia.\nJulia Barsuk in her bedroom in her Brighton Beach, New York, apartment circa 2005-2015. Barsuk was drafted into the Red Army to translate German wire communications on the Russian front during World War II. (Jonathan Alpeyrie)\nThough he had received papers saying he was no longer fit for active duty, in early 1942, he became part of a tank division on the North Caucasian front after convincing his superiors to send him back to the front. Casualties were very heavy as the Red Army concentrated on killing as many Germans as possible.\nBarsuk stayed in the North Caucasus until the end of 1942, then was sent back to  Moscow to provide technical support for armored units fighting on the front. He worked there until the end of the war but was often deployed to various fronts to ensure armored units had the proper replacement parts and pieces, and also went to factories to make sure they were working properly. When the war ended, Barsuk was in Red Square on May 8, 1945.\nADVERTISEMENT\nGregory Gurtovnik, Russia\nGregory Gurtovnik poses near the Russian World War II Association in Brighton Beach, New York, circa 2005-2015. Gurtovnik fought with the Red Army against the invading Germans and Axis allies. (Jonathan Alpeyrie)\n“The street fighting inside the city of Lvov was something I could never forget. Our men were dying by the thousands, littering the streets, the rooms inside the gutted apartment that we were defending. The Germans kept on coming and coming.”\nGregory Gurtovnik was born in Salnitza, Ukraine, and moved to Odessa with his family at the age of 7. They later moved to Samarkand during WWII. Gurtovnik volunteered for the Red Army at 18 and joined a tank outfit. He trained in Tajikistan and was sent with the 3rd Tank Army to Ukraine, where he participated in a major offensive to take Kiev from the Germans.\nThe unit was brought to Kanotop by rail and fought to cross the Dnieper River. The Germans were defeated, and more Russian units poured in. After four days, a major engagement followed in which Gurtovnik was wounded and then sent back to the front. After the battle of Kiev, he fought in western Ukraine and participated in battles at Ternopol and Lvov. The battle of Lvov was a hard-fought affair, as the Germans had a large army there and were making a last stand. In September 1944, Gurtovnik fought in Krakow and Berlin as the Red Army incurred heavy casualties. After the Polish campaign, his unit moved to the Elbe River to link up with American forces. The battle ended on May 2, 1945, and they moved to Prague to restore order. After the war, Gurtovnik pursued engineering and joined a submarine outfit.\nSemen Vaidman, Ukraine\nSemen Vaidman sits in his bedroom in his Brighton Beach, New York, home, circa 2005-2015. Vaidman fought with the Red Army as a Ukrainian against the invading Germans and Axis allies. (Jonathan Alpeyrie)\n“One morning, we left the line with 100 men in my company, but by the end of the day, only seven of my men and I came back. The Germans had ambushed us. My men were falling all around me. This was one of the hardest days of my life.”\nSemen Vaidman was born in Suvorovo, Ukraine, and spent his childhood in the village before moving to Odessa and Leningrad. He studied at a technical college and later military school. He was sent to Belarussia as part of the Red Army’s 318th Division, where he was an artillery company leader. In 1941, he was one of the division leaders when the Germans invaded Bobruysk. He was questioned by the NKVD for four months and later sent to Stalingrad. He became a drill instructor and commander of a 203-millimeter cannon company. After the Battle of Stalingrad, he returned to the front as part of the 112th Artillery Brigade and was promoted to captain. He fought through Poland and then Germany, where he remained after the war until 1948, fathering a son there. He returned to Moscow in 1959."}

Of these, 65% included violent aggression against people, and over 10% were physical assaults. This surge has created a climate where French Jews increasingly feel the need to hide their identity, such as by removing mezuzahs from homes or changing their names online, the report said.\nAntisemitism in France increasingly targets students, with the Ministry of National Education reporting a 420% increase in antisemitic acts in schools during the 2023-2024 school year. Surveys show that 64% of the French population believes Jews have reason to fear living in France, the report noted.\nIn Germany, Jews are increasingly under threat since the October 7 attacks, with an antisemitic front uniting elements from across the political spectrum, according to the Central Council of Jews in Germany. Israel-related antisemitism has sharply increased in universities, the arts and culture scene, and in media portrayals of Israel, the organization said.\nGerman police reported 3,200 antisemitic incidents from January 1 to October 7, 2024, after recording nearly 3,000 incidents, or 32 a day, in the three months following the attack of October 7, 2023.\nThe rise of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, classified by some states as right-wing extremist, is seen as a threat to Jewish religious life in Germany and practices like circumcision and religious slaughter, the report said.

In 2024, the United Nations General Assembly passed 17 resolutions condemning Israel, and only six against all other countries combined, the report said.\nThe International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which the report urged governments worldwide to adopt, says criticism of Israel that places a double standard on the country is a form of anti-Jewish hate.\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa, first row left, listens in Johannesburg on January 26, 2024, to the ruling from the top UN court that harshly criticized Israel’s war against the Hamas terror group in Gaza.

She called the allegations “profoundly disturbing” and said that, if proven true, the claims would violate the federal Fair Housing Act.\n“Discrimination on the basis of religion, race, national origin, or other protected characteristics — whether explicit or cloaked in pretext — is not only illegal but fundamentally un-American,” she wrote in a letter on Monday that backed a federal statement of interest in the case, one of several similar disputes in the tri-state area.\nThe defendants’ legal team responded in a letter to James’s office, saying that the town agreed with James’s support for religious liberty and housing non-discrimination, but that her characterization of the case was “inaccurate or incomplete.”\nThe dispute stems from a 2022 civil lawsuit filed in the federal Southern District of New York court against the town of Forestburgh, its zoning board, and several town officials. The plaintiffs are Lost Lake Holdings and Mishconos Mazah, companies owned by Hasidic Jews.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe two companies said they had bought land for a development in 2020. The previous owner, who was not Jewish, had obtained approval to build more than 2,600 residential units at the 3.3-square-mile site. The town board had described that development as a “wonderful project” and local residents backed the non-Jewish company, the lawsuit said. The rural town has a population of around 900.\nThe company failed to carry out the construction project, and the two Jewish companies bought the site. After local officials realized Hasidic Jews had acquired the land for development, the town set up a series of obstructions to prevent construction. Local officials and inspectors denied building permit applications, conducted an illegal search of the property, over-assessed the value of the site to drive up taxes, issued stop-work orders, and adopted a local law that imposed a 1,000% increase in fees, among other measures, the lawsuit alleged.\nIllustrative: This picture taken on April 5, 2019 shows shows two Jewish men hitchhiking during a rainfall in a Jewish neighborhood of Monsey in Rockland County, New York. (Johannes Eisele/AFP)\nInternal emails cited by James and federal officials suggested anti-Jewish discrimination played into the obstruction.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Don’t be scared about the Hasidic threat — we’re energized and have the cash to fight and make their lives miserable,” a local official said in an email, according to the federal attorneys.\n“Bloomingberg was asleep: we’re on amphetamines,” the email said, in an apparent reference to disputes between local officials and the Hasidic community in the nearby town of Bloomingburg.\nIn another email, a local resident wrote to town officials, “Their sect is notorious for mysogyny and child abuse,” and warned of “their wanton destruction of the towns and school districts.”\n“They take over, like locusts — killing everything they encounter, draining every last resource,” the email said. The town board planning chair forwarded the email to unknown recipients, saying, “I too have been thinking strategy about how to prevent Lost Lake from overwhelming this town,” according to the federal statement.\nTown officials were pushed by local residents who opposed the development, the plaintiffs said. Local social media groups and articles about the development were flooded with antisemitic comments. In some of the online comments cited by the lawsuit, area residents decried “dirty money” from the “Jewish mafia,” and said, “You wonder why Germans did what they say they did.”\nThe defendants’ lawyers responded to James in a Wednesday letter that a town official shared with The Times of Israel.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA local zoning law that James has said may illegally discriminate against religious land use had been misinterpreted, the town said. Places of worship are permitted throughout the town, subject to restrictions similar to those applied to non-religious buildings, in rules that are more permissive than in other local communities, the letter said.\nThe email about the “Hasidic threat” was from 2015, written by someone who was a private citizen at the time, and related to a fraud case in Bloomingburg, the letter said.\n“The Town categorically denies that any of its land use actions were based on the religious identity of the developer or potential homebuyers,” the town said.\nThe back-and-forth this week was the second exchange between the town and the attorney general’s office. Last year, James’s office warned the town that the rezoning ordinance “discriminates against Jewish New Yorkers” by illegally limiting religious land use. The town’s lawyers said that interpretation of the law appeared “to be based on a selective or incorrect factual record,” pointing to similar zoning rules for other buildings. The rules were put in place to keep development at a low density “to preserve the rural character of the Town,” the letter said.\nThe defendants have also disputed that the companies, and the property’s previous owner, had approval to build a large housing development. The development plans were “inconsistent with and materially different” from previous approvals, a town official said in a legal filing.\nThe thwarted plans have caused the developers significant financial damage and effectively stripped them of the property. The lawsuit seeks compensation, declarations of wrongdoing and to overturn the obstructions.\nThe US government weighed in on the case in March because of its interest in enforcing federal law, and because of US President Donald Trump’s January 2025 executive order on combating antisemitism, the Department of Justice said. The department also weighed in on the case in 2023.\nJames’s Monday letter supported the federal intervention, saying, “Your engagement in this matter sends a powerful message that no individual or community is above the law — and no community is beyond its protection.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Together, we must affirm the principle that government decisions must be based on law and evidence — not bias, fear, or bigotry,” James said, according to a copy of the letter James’s office shared with The Times of Israel.\nForestburgh is located in Sullivan County in the Catskills region, around a two-hour drive northwest of Manhattan.\nThe Satmar Hasidic village of Kiryas Joel. (JTA/Uriel Heilman)\nThe lawsuit illustrated ongoing disputes between Jewish and non-Jewish residents in areas surrounding New York City, as Jews move out of the city due to housing pressure. The disputes have exposed alleged antisemitism that takes place in quiet small town bureaucracy, away from the widely publicized discrimination occurring in forums like street protests and on college campuses, and unconnected to the Gaza war. The opposition is motivated by both generic resistance to community change and development, and anti-Jewish animus.\nThe Catskills region has a celebrated Jewish history stretching back more than a century. The so-called “Borscht Belt” drew throngs of Jewish visitors to the Catskills in the mid-1900s and has had a lasting impact on American culture, particularly in stand-up comedy. The Borscht Belt declined as antisemitism waned and Jewish tourists traveled elsewhere, contributing to an economic downturn in the region. Jews have launched efforts to revive the memory of the Borscht Belt in recent years with comedy shows, a museum and public placards.\nJewish camps and getaways are scattered across the region, many Jews have summer homes in the area, and there are several recently built Orthodox Jewish developments in the areas around Forestburgh.\nDespite warm memories of the Borscht Belt, a series of fires at the former hotels has given rise to antisemitic conspiracies.\nIn 1974, Hasidic Jews established the town of Kiryas Joel in Orange County, bordering Sullivan County. Hasidic expansion in that town and others in the area has sparked repeated disputes between Jewish and non-Jewish residents. In the small towns, growing Hasidic communities can fundamentally change the composition of the local population, leading to conflicts over control of local government and schools.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn addition to referring to Bloominburg, opponents of the development in Forestburgh repeatedly mentioned Kiryas Joel, according to the lawsuit. A town fire department official told the plaintiffs that residents feared the Hasidic “bloc vote,” comparing the situation to Kiryas Joel. Local reports about the development also drew comparisons, with comments warning of “Kiryas Joel part 2” and calling that community dirty, the lawsuit said.\nJames’s letter acknowledged that pattern, saying Orthodox Jews “too often faced bias masked as bureaucratic decision-making in matters of zoning, housing, and land use.”\nUsing zoning laws and land use regulations against Jews “recalls a dark history” that appears to be “reemerging in the 21st century,” James said.\nNew Jersey has seen similar conflicts, with local governments feuding with Jews over schools, zoning laws and a cemetery, including in recent weeks."}

His framing of the issue was echoed by a major Hasidic Satmar account on X in a statement celebrating the budget deal.\nHochul reportedly allied with Democratic state lawmakers in districts with large Hasidic concentrations on the changes with an eye to next year’s election.

Yeshivas will have more power, for example, to pick their own accreditation agencies — potentially even letting Hasidic communities set up agencies tailored to their schools.

Tuesday’s letter was a response to that motion.\nUS District Judge Tiffany Cartwright said the hostages had “stated a plausible claim that [the Palestine Chronicle] aided and abetted their kidnapping and Hamas’s acts of terrorism.”\nCartwright added that the Palestine Chronicle’s claims that it was ignorant of Aljamal’s terror ties were “unpersuasive.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraeli hostages pictured after their rescue from Hamas captivity in Gaza on June 8, 2024. From left: Shlomi Ziv (IDF); Andrey Kozlov and Almog Meir Jan (Avshalom Sassoni/Flash90); and Noa Argamani (Courtesy).\nAljamal’s direct communications with the defendants, his public appearances as a Hamas spokesperson, and his social media support for Hamas “support a reasonable inference that [the Palestine Chronicle] knew Aljamal was affiliated with Hamas and involved in the October 7 attack,” the judge said.\nShe added that the close relationship between the Palestine Chronicle and Aljamal, and the timing of their coordination on work activities, were reasons to believe that the nonprofit’s payments to Aljaamal assisted him in holding the hostages.\nThe court denied the Palestine Chronicle’s motion to dismiss and an attempt to prevent the case from entering the discovery phase.\nThe lawsuit, backed by the National Jewish Advocacy Center, was filed in a federal court in Washington State, where the People Media Project is based.\nThe lawsuit has also revealed that Aljamal told the hostages that “Hamas was in contact and actively coordinating with its affiliates in the media and on college campuses,” according to an amended complaint filed in February that was first reported by The Times of Israel.\nAljamal told the hostages that “Hamas was going to ensure that the United States, as well as Jews and Israelis, are hated everywhere and that Hamas in Gaza was coordinating with its allies, including its allies in the media and on college campuses, to foment hatred against Israel and Jews,” the complaint said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnti-Israel activists protest outside Columbia University, January 21, 2025. (Luke Tress/Times of Israel)\nThe Palestine Chronicle was reporting about US campus protests around the same time, and in August 2024, published an article about Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal urging university students to protest.\nAljamal was previously a spokesperson for the Hamas-run labor ministry in Gaza. He was open about his affiliation with the terror group, appearing publicly in Arabic media as a spokesperson and posting Hamas graphics and photos of his son wearing a Hamas headband on social media. He began writing for the Palestine Chronicle in 2019 while still serving as a spokesperson for Hamas’s labor ministry, according to the lawsuit.\nAljamal appears to have had foreknowledge of the Hamas attack. On October 7, at 5:43 a.m., immediately before the invasion, he posted a message on TikTok that said, “O God, guide us.. O God, grant us the victory that you promised.. O God, acceptance, acceptance, acceptance.. Your victory, O God,” followed by a heart emoji.\nLater in the day, Aljamal praised the attack on Facebook.\nHe began writing for the Palestine Chronicle more frequently after the attack, sometimes publishing multiple articles per day, while he was holding the Israelis hostage and communicating with the outlet’s staff in the US.\nImmediately after the hostage rescue, the Palestine Chronicle changed Aljamal’s description on its website from “correspondent” to “contributor,” then later described him as a “freelance contributor” writing on “a voluntary basis.” It also eulogized him in an article after his death, calling him a “well-known journalist murdered in Gaza,” and denied that he had been holding the hostages.\nThe hostages were aware that Aljamal was communicating with terror groups, recording footage and writing about their own captivity, the complaint said. All three were “terrorized” during their captivity, subjected to arbitrary punishment, physical threats, and physical and psychological abuse, the lawsuit said.\nThe outlet’s tax-exempt status means US taxpayers were subsidizing Hamas propaganda published to a US audience, the lawsuit argues, adding that the salary he was paid also helped him imprison the hostages."}

We are also proud Jews.”\nFor at least one of them, that may have changed.\nBen Cohen, the Ben of the pair, appeared on Tucker Carlson’s talk show this week, mostly to discuss his opposition to US involvement in the Ukraine war and the Pentagon’s sprawling budget, issues where his long-touted progressive ideals can overlap with Carlson’s far-right ones.\nThen, at the end of the hour-long show, Carlson asked Cohen about his “spiritual beliefs.”\n“In terms of a spiritual belief, I mean, I don’t practice a religion,” Cohen responded. “I was born a Jew. I love Jesus Christ. I think the words that he said are wonderful, are amazing. And, you know, I’m kind of distressed that a lot of organized Christian religions are not really, I don’t know, abiding by the words of Jesus Christ.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nHe added, “I think if we could follow the words of Jesus Christ and think about the Sermon on the Mount and, you know, take his words seriously, we wouldn’t be doing the stuff we’re currently doing.”\nThe Sermon on the Mount, in the New Testament Gospel of Matthew, is a series of widely known sayings in which Jesus outlines his moral vision.\nCohen’s religious inclinations are significant because Carlson is known for inviting antisemites, including a Holocaust revisionist, onto his show in the past. They are also important because Cohen and his co-founder Jerry Greenfield publicly marshaled their Judaism in defense of their company’s 2021 boycott.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe boycott drew widespread opposition from centrist and right-leaning Jewish groups, a wave of state-level legal challenges and led to a court battle that lasted years. Cohen and Greenfield — who grew up attending Hebrew school together on Long Island — sold the company to Unilever decades ago and no longer control it, though recently Cohen was reportedly planning a buyback.\n“That we support the company’s decision is not a contradiction nor is it anti-Semitic,” the pair wrote in the Times op-ed. “In fact, we believe this act can and should be seen as advancing the concepts of justice and human rights, core tenets of Judaism.”\nLater, they added, “As Jewish supporters of the State of Israel, we fundamentally reject the notion that it is anti-Semitic to question the policies of the State of Israel.”\nThe Carlson show, posted on Monday, also raises questions about whether Cohen would still identify as a supporter of Israel. The bulk of the interview was about Ukraine and the US defense budget, but near the end, when discussing why he thinks “we’re kind of headed toward war” in Iran, Cohen brought up Israel.\n“There seems to be some kind of strange relationship between Israel and the US, where, I don’t know, Israel now has the US supplying weapons for its genocide,” Cohen said. “And what I’m told is that Israel wants some concept of greater Israel. I mean, I don’t really know much about that.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n(The term “greater Israel” has generally referred to Israeli control of territories such as the West Bank and Gaza, rather than its regional conflict with Iran.)\nIn response to a subsequent question, he said, “Right now what it means to be American is that we are the world’s largest arms exporter, we have the largest military in the world, we support the slaughter of people in Gaza, if somebody protests the slaughter of people in Gaza, we arrest them. What does our country stand for?”\nThis is not the first time this year that Cohen has accused Israel of genocide in its war against Hamas in Gaza, a charge the country strenuously rejects. In March, he said, “The US supporting this genocide is essentially trampling on the soul of America,” and added, “It’s not a war, it’s a slaughter. I don’t think there’s much difference between somebody getting killed by a bomb or getting killed by being thrown in a gas chamber.”\nIn the interview on Monday, Carlson did not address Cohen’s statements on Israel. He seconded Cohen’s praise of Jesus.\nCohen has also recently begun promoting a website to back DOGE, the Elon Musk-run operation that has rapidly slashed parts of the federal government, including large global humanitarian programs. A request for comment via that website, which Cohen touts on his X account, was not immediately returned."}

(Israel Defense Forces)\nDrop in call-up rate\nThe war began on October 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed into Israel, killing 1,200 people and kidnapping 251 into Gaza.\nBar-Haim said the reserves call-up rate stood at over 100% at the start of the war. Now, he said, it has dropped to 75–85%.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe drop could be caused by long-term damage to soldiers’ careers and finances, harm to their families and social lives, anger over inequality in the burden of service, and a general decline in motivation due to the unusually prolonged nature of the war, he explained.\nYet the decrease could also be attributed to a deterioration in mental resilience among soldiers who developed multiple symptoms of PTSD as a result of their service.\nRise of symptoms\nThe researchers tracked 579 soldiers who enlisted in one of the IDF’s infantry brigades, at five different times since their initial recruitment in March 2019.\nThe soldiers completed a questionnaire developed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs, translated into Hebrew, considered the gold standard for self-reported PTSD symptom assessment. In the questionnaire, participants rated the severity of their symptoms.\nThe results of the questionnaire do not replace a formal diagnosis in a structured clinical interview, Bar-Haim said. However, many studies from Israel and abroad point to a strong correlation between the self-reported screening tool and the results of clinical interviews.\nThe findings showed that as the duration of military service increased, so did the percentage of soldiers reporting multiple PTSD symptoms at severity levels consistent with a clinical diagnosis according to the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition).\nADVERTISEMENT\nAt the time of their enlistment, less than 0.5% of recruits suffered from preexisting PTSD. After 15 months in the army, including six months of combat training and about nine months of operational activity, the number rose to 2.6%.\nToward the end of mandatory service, after several additional rounds of operational activity, it rose to 4.4%.\nIDF soldiers standing atop a battle tank as part of the Givati Brigade operating in eastern Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, in a handout picture released on May 10, 2024. (Israel Defense Forces/AFP)\nAlthough there had been hope that symptoms would subside after the soldiers’ discharge, there was actually another increase six months later, with nearly 8% of the soldiers reporting multiple PTSD symptoms.\nBar-Haim said the reasons were unclear, but “the military framework provides support and a sense of belonging, which fades after discharge when each soldier returns home and resumes civilian life.”\nThe final assessment was made a few months after the outbreak of the current war.\n“As expected, the war deepened psychological difficulties,” Bar-Haim said, “with the number of soldiers reporting post-traumatic symptoms rising to about 12%.”\nThe data from the study aligns with the number of discharged combat soldiers who are turning to the Defense Ministry’s rehabilitation department for help and recognition of their condition, Bar-Haim said.\nDavid Moshe of the Chayal’s Angels doing cranial sacral therapy on an IDF soldier, December 17, 2023. (Courtesy)\nHe said the numbers partially explain the decline in reserves duty participation rates. Reserves soldiers experiencing multiple symptoms find it difficult to show up for additional service. In June 2024, Bar-Haim urged the army to exempt reservists with PTSD from additional military service until their treatment has been completed.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe IDF is taking many steps to prevent and treat PTSD, he added, putting immense strain on the army, the Defense Ministry, the Rehabilitation Department, and Israeli society as a whole.\n“But the main burden is on the combat soldiers and their families,” Bar-Haim said."}

It is set to be discussed again in two months.\nThe Law of Return was formulated in 1950, two years after the State of Israel was established, giving every Jew from around the world the automatic right to immigrate to the Jewish State. “Every Jew has the right to come to this country as an oleh [immigrant],” it states.\nFor years, lawmakers disagreed on how to define exactly who is considered a Jew for this purpose. While Orthodox religious authorities traditionally only recognize as Jewish those who have a Jewish mother, or those who converted to Judaism in an Orthodox court, the law was expanded in 1970 to also allow any grandchild of a Jew to immigrate, even if they themselves are not Jewish. The 1970 amendment also allows for the legal immigration of non-Jewish spouses of Jews.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nA Supreme Court ruling in November 2023 added that widows of children or grandchildren of Jews are also entitled to immigrant status.\nMaoz also proposed a similar motion in 2023. The change would wreak havoc for new immigrants from Russia, where the majority of new olim have come from in recent years, of whom many are not considered Jewish according to religious law.\nThe law as it currently stands “allows it to be exploited by many who have severed all ties with the Jewish people and their traditions, and in effect empties the law of its original intention,” Maoz’s proposal states. Repealing the grandchild clause would “prevent one of the greatest absurdities in the Israeli law book — that the most explicit Jewish law gives sweeping permission for non-Jews to enter the country’s gates,” he wrote.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDebating the proposal in the Knesset, the United Torah Judaism party’s Deputy Transportation Minister Uri Maklev charged that the law currently allows for religious fraud. “There could be a person who goes to church every Sunday with his parents, who comes and says he wants to enter as a Jew.”\nCommunications Minister Shlomo Karhi (Likud) added that the purpose of the 1970 amendment was to provide a haven for anyone persecuted for being Jewish. “No one dreamed that complete gentiles would come for economic purposes, like the kind that [Yisrael Beytenu MK Avigdor] Liberman brings, who receive a package of benefits and then return home after two days.”\nYisrael Beytenu party chair Avigdor Liberman leads a faction meeting at the Knesset in Jerusalem, on December 16, 2024 (Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)\nLiberman shot back, arguing that real Jews serve in the IDF, unlike many in the ultra-Orthodox community.\n“7,000 soldiers whose father or grandfather were Jewish stood up for the country, fighting and defending us, and dozens of them fell in the Iron Swords War,” he wrote on X, using the IDF’s official name for the current war. “In their actions, they proved that they are much more Jewish than any draft-evader who harms Israel’s security.”\nDemocrats MK Gilad Kariv accusing Karhi of being a “racist,” posting on X that “the contribution of 1.2 million Russian-speaking Israelis to Israel’s society, to national security, and to Judaism is priceless. It is dozens of times greater than the contribution of this group of hatred, division and incitement, of which Karhi is one of the leaders.”\nYesh Atid MK Vladimir Beliak, a Russian-born immigrant, also responded harshly.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Forty immigrant soldiers from the former Soviet Union were killed in the war, and over 400 were injured,” he wrote on X. “At least 18 immigrant citizens were killed, and five were kidnapped in Gaza. The Hamas terrorists did not ask under which article they immigrated to Israel. None of this prevents Karhi from slandering the immigrant community.”\nMost coalition parties are expected to vote in favor of rescinding the grandchild clause when it is brought back for debate in two months, according to a report by the public broadcaster Kan. The only obstacle to the legislation is a coalition agreement that gives veto power to Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar and his New Hope party. However, Sa’ar’s party is on the verge of merging with Likud, at which point he will lose that veto power, the report said."}

(Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nMeanwhile, UTJ lawmaker Yaakov Asher warned, in a Monday interview with the Haredi news site Kikar HaShabbat, that if the Knesset did not pass draft exemption legislation by the end of the summer session, July 27, his party would no longer be able to remain in the government.\n“If this law does not pass in this session… we will have a very big problem sitting in such a government, period,” he said, adding that UTJ “cannot be part of a government” that turns Haredim into “criminals.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThings escalated even further the next day, with the military announcing on Tuesday evening that Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir had ordered the IDF Personnel Directorate to immediately provide a plan to “expand and maximize” the number of draft orders sent to young ultra-Orthodox men — enraging the Haredi community.\nIn response, Netanyahu on Wednesday invited Shas chairman Deri, Defense Minister Israel Katz and Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee chairman Yuli Edelstein to a last-ditch meeting in an attempt to arrive at a compromise regarding the long-delayed bill regulating Haredi military enlistment.\nEdelstein, a member of Netanyahu’s ruling Likud party, has long blocked the advancement of the exemption legislation through his committee, pledging that any law on the issue of Haredi service would “significantly increase the IDF’s conscription base.”\nEdelstein had announced on Tuesday that after exhaustive debate, his committee was “one step away” from drafting a new version of the law — raising Haredi concerns that he would advance a version mandating harsh sanctions on draft evaders.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz (left) shakes hands with Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chairman Yuli Edelstein during a committee discussion on the IDF conscription law in the Knesset on January 21, 2025. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nThe Prime Minister’s Office attempted to present Wednesday evening’s meeting in a positive light, releasing a statement claiming that “progress was noted at the meeting, and it was agreed that the discussions will continue in an attempt to bridge the gaps.”\nHowever, leaks from the meeting published in the Hebrew press paint a different picture. Channel 12’s Amit Segal tweeted that “a furious Netanyahu threatened the ultra-Orthodox parties in his coalition that he’ll go to elections,” and national broadcaster Kan reported that Deri rejected Edelstein’s proposal that the IDF begin by conscripting half of each year’s annual ultra-Orthodox draft cohort.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to Kan, United Torah Judaism chairman Yitzchak Goldknopf, a major stakeholder, was not even invited because the other participants believed he would reject any compromise raised during the meeting.\nFollowing the meeting, a UTJ party source launched a scathing attack on Netanyahu, telling ultra-Orthodox news site Behadrei Haredim that the premier had “forgotten that he signed [in his coalition agreements] with United Torah Judaism and Shas that the conscription law would be enacted immediately upon the formation of the government.”\nThe Haredim, the source added, “do not want discussions and do not want progress,” but rather the immediate passage of a law — something that has become increasingly difficult politically due to widespread public opposition to Haredi military exemptions, including within the coalition itself.\n“As soon as the ultra-Orthodox parties realize that Netanyahu cannot muster a majority [to pass] the conscription law [with provisions maintaining the Haredi exemption from service], they will leave the government,” Avi Mimran, a broadcaster with the ultra-Orthodox radio station Kol Hai, told The Times of Israel on Wednesday. “After two years of waiting, the final deadline has arrived.”\nHousing and Construction Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf speaks at a faction meeting for his ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party on March 3, 2025. (Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)\nCohen was slightly less certain, noting that if the ultra-Orthodox parties “had better alternatives” to the Netanyahu coalition, they would probably have bolted already.\n“Will they bring down the government, or will they withdraw from the coalition and support it from outside? I don’t know what to tell you, and anything can happen,” including an ongoing boycott of all coalition legislation, he said.\nHowever, if the army sends out 60,000 enlistment orders to Haredi yeshiva students — as IDF chief Zamir appears to be demanding — and then begins actively arresting those who refuse to serve, Cohen believes that the Haredim would “leave the coalition in a second,” with Shas following United Torah Judaism’s lead.\nKan reported that during Wednesday evening’s meeting, Defense Minister Katz promised not to engage in any enforcement against those ignoring the new enlistment orders demanded by Zamir.\nADVERTISEMENT\nUTJ’s exit would not topple the government, but it would leave it with a bare 61-59 seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset. It would take the defection of both ultra-Orthodox parties to deprive the government of its Knesset majority.\nUltra-Orthodox Jews protest the IDF draft outside the Jerusalem enlistment center, April 28, 2025.

(Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nThursday’s hearing largely focused on ensuring that any large influx of ultra-Orthodox soldiers — who refuse to serve in mixed units and fear that insufficient care for their needs will harm their lifestyle and secularize them — does not negatively affect the rights of female troops.\nBrig. Gen. Shay Tayeb, head of the IDF Personnel Directorate’s Planning and Personnel Management Division, told lawmakers that the number of women serving in combat roles has increased significantly in recent years, rising from 500 to 4,500 over the past decade.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe number of women serving in the reserves has also increased significantly, he said — noting that while women comprised only three percent of reservists during the 2006 Second Lebanon War, this increased to 8% during Operation Protective Edge in 2014, and to 20% during the current war.\nAccording to Tayeb, while not all combat roles are yet open to women, the army has made “unprecedented” efforts to integrate women, including religious ones, into combat units.\nOrthodox women are exempt from military service, with many in the religious Zionist community choosing to volunteer for national service instead. However, their numbers are growing, and one unit for religious female fighters has already been established, with more on the way, Tayeb said.\nIDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen.

(Sam Sokol/Times of Israel)\nDespite the prime minister’s assurances to his ultra-Orthodox allies, the legislation, angrily referred to by critics as an “evasion law,” has long been held up in the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, whose chairman, Yuli Edelstein (Likud), has pledged that he will “only produce a real conscription law that will significantly increase the IDF’s conscription base.”\nAddressing a conference organized by the national-religious broadsheet Makor Rishon on Tuesday, Edelstein said that after exhaustive debate, his committee was “one step away” from drafting a new version of the law.\nIf the bill fails to pass, or if it passes in a format that does not maintain widespread Haredi exemptions, it could significantly threaten the stability of the coalition.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn Monday evening, UTJ lawmaker Yaakov Asher told Haredi news site Kikar HaShabbat that if the military exemptions were not legislated by the end of the summer session, his party would  no longer be able to remain in the government.\nUTJ’s exit would not topple the government but it would leave it with a bare 61-seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset.\nRabbinical courts\nThe Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee has resumed debating a controversial bill intended to grant state rabbinic courts the power to arbitrate civil proceedings according to religious law if both parties consent.\nWhile its backers say that the measure would allow for “legal pluralism,” critics believe that, if passed, it would significantly harm women.\nIsraelis protest the government’s planned judicial overhaul outside the Rabbinical Court in Tel Aviv, July 18, 2023 (Miriam Alster/Flash90)\nAccording to the ITIM nonprofit — which helps Israelis navigate the country’s religious bureaucracy — the religious court system, whose judges are all men, “is fundamentally male-oriented, which naturally raises concerns about structural harm to women’s rights, even if unintentional.”\nIn addition, “religious courts are not bound by the protective laws that the state has enacted to protect workers’ rights,” the group said in a position paper late last year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSplitting the AG’s role\nThe coalition is also pushing a variety of bills that critics warn are intended to silence detractors and weaken oversight, including a measure to dilute the powers of the attorney general and create a new criminal prosecution service, putting the government in charge of who heads it.\nThe bill, which was approved by the Ministerial Committee for Legislation on Sunday, would essentially split off the role of chief prosecutor from the attorney general’s job description, and put it in the hands of a “prosecutor general” who would be nominated by the justice minister and approved by the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, which is controlled by the coalition.\nOpposition parties have denounced the legislation as an effort by the government to influence Netanyahu’s ongoing corruption trial and weaken the institution of criminal prosecution in general, especially when it comes to suspected political corruption. The coalition has argued, however, that the bill is crucial in ensuring that the head of the criminal prosecution is independent of the government, because the attorney general, as the government’s chief legal adviser, is supposed to also help it achieve its policy goals.\nAttorney General Gali Baharav-Miara attends a Constitution, Law and Justice Committee meeting in the Knesset, Jerusalem, November 18, 2024. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nTaxing NGOs, disqualifying candidates\nAt the same time, lawmakers are also debating legislation that would levy massive taxes on nongovernment organizations funded by foreign governments, and erode their right to file lawsuits in Israeli courts.\nThe bill, sponsored by Likud MK Ariel Kallner, would allow the government to tax foreign government donations to domestic nonprofits at a rate of 80 percent, while also stipulating that courts need not consider petitions by groups “primarily financed by a foreign political entity.”\nGroups such as B’Tselem, Breaking the Silence, and the New Israel Fund have long been targeted by the right wing and even the political center over their focus on alleged Israeli human rights abuses against Palestinians.\nWhile backers argue that the bill would protect civil society from malign foreign influence, critics have said the government has no moral standing to complain about outside actors as two of Netanyahu’s top aides are under investigation for alleged financial ties to Qatar.\nDuring a debate on Monday, Hadash-Ta’al MK Ahmad Tibi claimed that the bill was intended “to prevent campaigns to encourage voting in Arab society.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nTibi noted that the coalition is also currently working to pass a bill “that aims to make it easier to disqualify Arab slates” from running for Knesset.\nAn Israeli casts a vote at a voting station in Jerusalem on March 23, 2021.

The bill would see the department instead report directly to a cabinet minister and come under the supervision of the Justice Ministry’s director general.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe department is currently tasked with investigating suspected crimes committed by police officers and employees of the Shin Bet security agency, and can in certain cases conduct criminal and disciplinary investigations into wrongdoing by civil service employees. Under the new law, the DIPI’s powers would also be expanded to allow probes into state prosecutors.\nJustice Minister Yariv Levin, right, and Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara attend a farewell ceremony for then-acting Supreme Court President Uzi Vogelman, at the Supreme Court in Jerusalem, October 1, 2024.

The bill passed a preliminary reading in the Knesset in November 2024, but when it later came up for discussion in the Economic Affairs Committee, Bitan said that he “can’t advance this bill for a simple reason — public broadcasting is necessary.”\nA similar bill would shutter Army Radio.\nLikud members (L-R) Shlomo Karhi, David Bitan and David Amsalem attend a committee meeting at the Knesset on November 20, 2023. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nIn an effort to bypass opposition from Knesset Economic Affairs Committee Chairman David Bitan (Likud), Karhi has proposed establishing a new “media committee,” an idea rejected by Bitan but reportedly supported by Netanyahu.\nBitan has also pledged to freeze work on legislation that would grant the government oversight over television ratings data and force broadcasters to regularly report such data, which Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara has argued would violate key constitutional principles, including the right to privacy and freedom of the press.\nHowever, Bitan indicated that he would not hinder two additional bills — one that would compel Kan to justify its decisions to the committee on an annual basis, and another that would give the government direct instead of indirect control over the broadcaster’s budget. These, he said, would be considered by the committee.\nImmunity from investigation\nLawmakers may also advance legislation aimed at providing criminal protection to IDF soldiers and members of the intelligence and security communities who provide intelligence without authorization to the prime minister and members of his security cabinet.\nAnother bill that could also potentially advance is an initiative by firebrand Likud MK Tally Gotliv strengthening MKs’ parliamentary immunity.\nAnother bill that has not yet been submitted but that could come up during the current legislative session is a proposal by Likud MK Kallner to establish an alternative probe into the events of October 7, 2023.\nAnti-government activist Shikma Bressler (R) and MK Tally Gotliv (C) arrive for a court hearing in Bressler’s defamation lawsuit against Gotliv at the District Court in Lod, September 17, 2024.

While the global norm stands at one career firefighter per every 1,000 residents, Israeli fire teams are only able to employ one firefighter for every 4,500 people.\n“We are stretched from end to end,” said Fire and Rescue Authority spokeswoman Tal Volvovitch to The Times of Israel in January.\nBut no amount of government backing will be able to speed up the decades-long process needed for Canada Park to return to what it once was.\n“In order to once again call this place a forest, we’ll need at least 20 years, and that’s only on the condition it doesn’t catch fire again,” Zakharia said, pointing to decades-old oak trees planted in the 1970s, when the park was founded. Even saplings will likely take at least three years to bloom.\nHistory enthusiasts take part in the reenactment of the 1187 Knights pilgrimage to Jerusalem, in Canada Park, on December 14, 2018.

My journey began the day before, departing from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. First to JFK, then on to Tel Aviv. The flight crew was mostly Israeli, and the passengers were almost entirely Israelis as well.\nI had a window seat — row 44J. I remember this because, mid-flight, my sister messaged asking exactly where I was sitting (an odd question). Moments later, a good friend of hers — on the same flight — came over to say hi. Random? Not really. From the minute I boarded, despite flying solo and knowing no one, I felt surrounded by family. And if — God forbid — an emergency arose, I had no doubt there were plenty of people on board who would have my back.\nAt 9:21 a.m., we touched down at Ben Gurion International Airport, just outside Terminal 3. As we slowed on the runway, I thought I could hear the faint sound of sirens. The normally loud wail was muffled by the triple-paned, insulated windows, and I wasn’t sure if I was imagining it. Deja vu? Maybe. It had been a while since I’d been back.\nI texted my family that I’d landed, looked out the window, and got a call from my sister in Hod HaSharon. She was sitting in the stairwell of her building — sirens were, in fact, real and had blanketed the entire center of the country. “Welcome to the war zone,” she said, with a sarcastic undertone. As if to say, Isn’t this new routine of ours just lovely?!\nSadly, she’s not wrong. Too often, she checks in on our family group chat from that stairwell. I wish she had a safe room in her apartment. Maybe one day.\nWhile we were still on the plane, the captain came over the loudspeaker. There was indeed a warning siren. All airport aviation crews and personnel had taken shelter, and we would need to wait for support to guide us to the gate.\nI stared out the window — and then, I witnessed the unimaginable.\nJust 300 yards away, beyond the perimeter fence, something streaked from the sky and slammed into the ground. A giant splash of brownish-red earth exploded upward like a volcanic eruption. Then the smoke rose. My mouth was wide open. “What just happened?!” I said to my sister. “I saw the missile fall.”\n“No, Raina, don’t worry,” she said, dialing down her earlier remark. “You didn’t see a missile. There’s been some reporting, but it’s south of you.”\n“I need to hang up.”\nI quickly snapped a photo, still trying to process what I’d seen. Around me, my fellow passengers and the flight crew seemed unaware. I suddenly felt a deep pang of guilt. I hadn’t been to Israel since October 7th. I tried to stay connected, tried to stay informed — but nothing from afar comes close to what my family and friends have endured these past 500-plus days. It’s been hell.\nAnd here I was — more American than Israeli these days — just showing up and thinking I saw what I saw?\nThere have been hundreds of Houthi missile strikes from Yemen—about 370, according to the nightly news, including drones and failed attacks. Only two have made impact on Israeli soil, and thankfully, neither caused serious damage. The Arrow and THAAD defense systems — Israel’s and America’s — have been remarkably effective at intercepting these threats over the sea or mid-air.\nI questioned whether I had the right to trust my internal “Israeli antenna.” Whether I had any claim to the instincts I once owned. Not living through these horrors daily has left me with a sense of guilt — and the feeling that I’d lost a certain rite of passage.\nFor context: I made aliyah when I was 10, grew up in Israel, served two years in the IDF, graduated from the Technion. My stepdad was part of the team that developed the Iron Dome. Israel is in my DNA.\nAround me, the passengers — including the grumpy old man who sat next to me the whole flight — were gathering their belongings, oblivious. The flight attendant was chatting with a few travelers, when someone pointed out, “The front of the plane is already empty.” She was surprised — and just like that, we all quickly deplaned.\nI walked through the terminal, slowing as I passed the now-infamous poster boards of the hostages still being held in Gaza’s gates of hell. I paused at a few, took a picture, let the images soak in — but felt a pull to keep moving.\nAt one point, I passed a designated “protected area” where about 50 people were jammed in like sardines. A female security guard stood with her arms out, telling us they were at capacity and we had to keep moving. Strangely, none of us had been told to take shelter. So we obeyed, and kept walking.\nOnce I reached the eerily empty baggage claim, I had a moment to check my phone. Around me, others were doing the same. It quickly became clear: this was serious. The airport had been shut down. Planes behind us were being diverted — some circling above, some turning back to Europe. I was supposed to meet my nephew via train, but the rail lines were shut down too.\nSo imagine this: You take a 14-hour flight. You’re tired, hungry. You land to the sound of a muffled siren. There are no workers on the tarmac. The area is evacuated. And just a quarter mile from your seat — a missile hits.\nThe conveyor belts are frozen. The luggage is still on the plane. You slowly realize they rushed us off the aircraft not because things were calm, but because they didn’t want us to be sitting ducks.\nAnd yet, here we all were. Strangers. Family. The same grumpy old man waved me over with a smile, gesturing that he had saved me a seat on the bench. No one was angry. No one panicked. Everyone was calm — oddly relaxed — as we waited.\nAbout 30 minutes later, the airport officially reopened. Our luggage came out. I collected mine and made my way toward the train station. The lines had just resumed, and the train was about to pull out.\nI spent the next two hours on the train heading north — Tel Aviv to Haifa to the Krayot. No one around me had the first-hand experience I’d just had. Most weren’t jet-lagged. But all were talking about the incident. Everyone cared.\nThat’s what binds Israelis together. The topic isn’t fun — but the unity, the passion, the shared urgency — it’s almost beautiful. The way people discuss it. The attention to detail. The facts. The facts. You hear it from everyone—young soldiers, professionals, parents, kids. One topic. One thread. One people.\nAs I sat back in my seat, I felt comforted. I felt clarity. We will prevail. The moment I’d just lived through was heavy — but not defeating. It was empowering.\nIsrael is under daily attack. Fifty-nine hostages remain trapped, so close yet just out of reach. They’re living in the dungeons of hell. This is not a joke. Not taken lightly. Israelis are serious. We deal in truth. We stand tall. We don’t cower. We keep moving forward — and upward.\nI got off at the final station in Nahariya and hugged my mom.\nI dodged a ballistic missile.\nAm Yisrael dodged a ballistic missile.\nIf we had landed 60 seconds later… if the wind had shifted by just one knot… or if any of a million “what ifs” had played out differently, the day could have been a disaster of unthinkable scale.\nI don’t know why things unfolded the way they did. I don’t know why Arrow and THAAD failed this one time.\nAll I know is: everything happens for a reason.\nSunday, I lived out a miracle.\nSunday, I dodged a ballistic missile."}

The impetus for their drastic threat to leave was the administration’s recent settlement agreement to let a small group of LGBTQ students meet over pizza.\nIt is the most recent chapter in a 2021 lawsuit brought against Yeshiva University by the YU Pride Alliance, an unofficial student group. The case has, since then, roiled the university. \nAccording to the New York Times, Yeshiva agreed to recognize the club (now renamed “Hareni”), bringing to an end its attempt to deny the group official recognition on religious grounds. The school’s clubs are required to adhere to the norms of halakha — Jewish law — but exactly what that means in the case of an LGBTQ club is still being hotly contested. \nThe school had originally responded to the students’ request by creating a club that would, in the words of the dean of the rabbinical school, “allow for students who are battling this yetzer hara [evil inclination] to gather for rabbinically approved events to help them omed b’nisayon [meet the challenge] to resist all temptation to act upon their desires.” What the rabbis envisioned as a celibacy support club had zero student buy-in and zero student attendance.\nZak Sawyer, a spokesman for the students, said that the settlement went far beyond the university’s original offer. He claims that Hareni secured written guarantees ensuring that it would have the same rights and privileges as other student clubs, including access to campus spaces, official student event calendars, and the ability to use LGBTQ in its public materials — none of which existed under YU’s prior “initiative.”\nThe news of the Hareni club’s establishment touched off a storm in the YU community. Beyond the threats of resignation, truly offensive comments were made in public. Speaking to Haredi podcaster David Lichtenstein, Rabbi Hershel Schachter, an esteemed senior Talmud professor, and Rabbi Aryeh Lebowitz, the dean of the rabbinical school, portrayed these YU students as reshaim and kofrim (wicked people and heretics).\nIn the same podcast, Rabbi Schachter appears to painfully misconstrue the students’ motives. He claimed that the impetus for the club is part of a worldwide campaign to undermine creation, “convince the whole world that men should become women, and women should become men.”\nThese students, however, did not come to YU to wage a cultural battle. They came for an array of personal reasons, central among them a hunger for intense Jewish learning and a collegiate experience of religious communal life. For them, the club is a resource for remaining Orthodox, not unraveling it.\nThese young people are not culture war rebels trying to undermine the creation; they are responding to it. They simply reflect our generation’s recognition of human complexity. The Talmudic sages addressed categories of gender complexity not mentioned in the Torah as a response to their own lived experience. More to the point, these young people are not activists. They do not want to overthrow thousands of years of tradition. They just want a context for support, friendship, and learning.\nOne of the telling and disturbing questions posed to Rabbi Schachter related to ideological conflict: the Temple in Jerusalem was led for over 200 years by a heretical sect, the Sadducees, during which time the Temple functioned. No one thought to close it down. If the Temple, and later the Great Sanhedrin, could tolerate strongly differing ideologies and practices, why should a gay club be a reason to close the yeshiva? Indeed, Rabbi Schachter admitted the point and had no substantive response. \nThe question is even sharper, given that YU is a bona fide university and was intentionally founded on Torah and open inquiry (Torah U’Madda). Why, among the tradition’s many tensions with modern values, methods, and sensibilities, should a gay club be a hill to die on? Why are so many other modern conflicts tolerable, and this one not? \nI wonder how these learned men, involved for so long in education, could be so terribly unempathetic to the realities of their students. When their students bring to them challenges in areas of medical ethics, family dynamics, and mental health, they are open-hearted and thoughtful. Why then can they not respond to their LGBTQ students with the same empathy and respect?\nIt is true that the exercise of radical empathy can loosen one’s grip on authority and certainty. Parents discover this every day. Orthodox parents of LGBTQ children have their world turned upside down when their children come out. In time, however, they often say that the experience made them much better parents.\nEmpathy is where it starts, but the work then demands the humility to admit what one does not know, and a willingness to learn. This is true of many contemporary halakhic questions. Becoming familiar with the varieties of scholarship that can shed light on a questioner’s circumstances is essential for giving a reliable psak halakha (halakhic ruling). \nMoreover, the failure of both empathy and inquiry in this case has life and death consequences. In the podcast, Rabbi Schachter concedes that hundreds of Orthodox LGBTQ young people are so torn that they contemplate suicide and sometimes act upon suicidal thoughts. Given such high stakes, wouldn’t we expect rabbis to pursue halakhic remedies with a much greater sense of urgency?\nSadly, the opposite is true. Fifty years ago, the former president of the university, Rabbi Norman Lamm, zt”l, offered a limited, but highly creative, halakhic framework for understanding human sexuality. Other Modern Orthodox rabbis in the US, Israel, and the UK have built upon Rabbi Lamm’s work to move their policies in shuls and schools toward acceptance. But not at YU.\nAnd the absence of remedies affects thousands. Even if one assumes that the incidence of LGBTQ identity is 1 out of 15 (and it could be double that), there are at least 15,000 Orthodox homes across the United States in which parents are (or should be) dealing with the fact that one of their children is lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.\nWhat does Rabbi Schachter expect of these young people? What trajectory is he offering them? What adult future can they hope for? What guidance is he providing for their parents?\nAt Eshel (the organization for Orthodox LGBTQ people and their families that I helped found), we asked the parents who came to our parents’ retreats just this question. We found that 93 percent of the Orthodox parents we work with want their kids to find a life-long Jewish partner. The overwhelming sentiment is: “It’s not good for a person to be alone.” \nIf a credible adult life is not offered in earnest within the Orthodox context, then these young people will either marry deceptively and destructively out of desperation or conclude that Orthodox leadership is frozen in time and incapable of learning. It is no surprise that most just walk away. \nWhen I first heard of the compromise, I felt it could work. The students would not be permitted to cover the yeshiva with pride flags, but the members would have a space for open and honest sharing in group meetings, a context for raising questions and finding support. \nI also had the hope that Hareni could offer the rabbinic leadership a sustained opportunity to learn about, and even from, these young people. And what better training ground could there be for rabbinical students? With the help of Hareni members, the rabbis-in-training could grapple with issues that will surely follow them to future pulpits and classrooms. Breakthroughs cannot emerge in silence, but they just might in engagement. \nMy rebbe, Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein, zt”l, was once asked a hard question: What would he do regarding the general halakha that justifies violating Shabbat to save a Jewish life on Shabbat, but not a non-Jewish life? His answer was that he would save a non-Jew’s life on Shabbat and be happy to be judged by heaven and punished in the particular hell set aside for such violators. \nEven if he did not wish to make a full halakhic argument for his choice, Rav Lichtenstein was clearly choosing a broad ethic of human dignity over a statutory halakhic norm, the moral salience of which he could no longer defend. \nHe was willing to throw himself on the mercies of the heavenly court and suffer the consequences, rather than violate what he deemed to be the greater duty. I am eternally grateful for the student who dared to ask such a hard question and for my rebbe, who was unafraid to provide a deep and wholly unconventional response. \nWe are all in desperate need of religious advisers who are not frightened by hard questions and human realities that challenge assumptions, who are willing — in the service of the One who protects the vulnerable — to learn what they do not know about an experience that is foreign to them, and who are ready to risk losing a measure of certainty, if only to accompany us on our journey."}

Iran will be forced to dismantle its nuclear facilities or maybe just cease enrichment; maybe destroy its centrifuges “nicely” or have them blown up “viciously,” or maybe just promise not to use them to make weapons. Anyone trying to follow US President Donald Trump’s sudden and frequent policy lurches will be tempted to reach for the Dramamine. Politicians often change their minds – then-Senator John Kerry was famously for the war in Iraq before he was against it – but it’s safe to say no president has ever executed so many head-spinning, diametric reversals in so short a time. Four months have not yet passed since his inauguration.\nThis chaotic behavior, in my view, has two sources. The first is Trump’s desperate need to see himself as a winner (even if not actually winning). The second is competition for his attention among close advisors with very different views. Most relevant for Israel is the cleavage within his foreign-policy team. Vice President JD Vance, Susie Wiles, and Donald Trump Jr. lead a neo-isolationist cadre that gauges foreign relations in terms of transactional benefits to America. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz advocate a more assertive – and more traditionally Republican – US role in global affairs. Trump also pays attention to media gadflies such as Tucker Carlson and Laura Loomer, who serve as windows to the soul of his political base.\nTrump listens to these discordant voices and decides whose advice is likely, at a given juncture, to make him look like a winner. And he goes with that until it no longer feels like winning. Then he goes with someone else. The underlying merits and the repercussions are secondary or irrelevant. What counts is public perception, or at least how he reads it.\nUpon assuming office for the second time, Trump’s priority was to banish as much global conflict as possible so as to burnish his war-ending persona and draw a favorable contrast from his predecessor. That didn’t work so well with Russia and Ukraine, but like virtually all previous US presidents, he knew he could pressure Israel into supporting American priorities – in this case, a ceasefire with Hamas. It took Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by surprise but didn’t work out too badly for him, since a substantial segment of the Israeli public supported the agreement’s first phase and Netanyahu declined, without backlash, to pursue the far more controversial subsequent phases.\nPresident Donald Trump speaks while meeting with Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni (unseen) in the Oval Office of the White House, April 17, 2025, in Washington, as Vice President JD Vance, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth listen. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\nSince then, Trump has threatened Hamas with “hell to pay” if all hostages – or American hostages, or, right, actually all hostages – were not released; unleashed substantial firepower against Yemen’s Houthi rebels and threatened them with “complete annihilation”; and reimposed “maximum pressure” sanctions against Iran while threatening to destroy their nuclear facilities. These all bear the fingerprints of the muscular foreign-policy cadre.\nHamas neither released any hostages nor faced hell, Iran remained defiant, and the Houthis still managed to mount attacks against ships in the Red Sea, including American naval vessels. Plainly, none of this felt very much like winning. Soon, Trump was engaging in dialogue with Iran, which obliged him by muzzling the Houthis to “build momentum” in the talks – i.e., to hand Trump a win he could boast of and a debt to be collected later. The neo-isolationists now had the upper hand. Unsourced statements suggested Trump might even be considering a return to the terms of Obama’s disastrous nuclear deal with Iran, which would please the neo-isolationists since they don’t perceive Iran as a threat to US shores. But it ignited a firestorm among right-wing commentators, who reminded Trump how mightily he inveighed against that deal before dramatically exiting it in 2018. Manhood check! Trump quickly pivoted to “nicely” or “viciously” and postponed further talks.\nRead: Trump: Iran’s centrifuges will either ‘blow up nicely’ in a deal or ‘viciously’ without one\nWhat happens next? Talks with Iran are back on. The neo-isolationists perceive the vigor of Trump’s manly threats as cover for a renewed effort to accommodate the mullahs. If they can get some concession from Iran that arguably – even if not credibly – extends beyond the Obama deal, they think they can sell it to Trump as a momentous win. They have learned by now that no line he draws in the sand is fixed if its erasure can be spun favorably.\nIn the meantime, Trump’s team has been feeling out the possibility of bringing Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords – a signature Trump win in his first administration. Getting Saudi on board would not only gild that win but achieve what his hated predecessor, Joe Biden, sought strenuously but failed to obtain. The obstacles were, and remain, Saudi insistence on an end to the Gaza war and a pathway to Palestinian statehood as prerequisites.\nJoe Biden and his State Department seemed genuinely puzzled over Israel’s refusal on both counts. But they overestimated the value of Saudi normalization to Israel. The two countries have cooperated fruitfully and quietly since Obama signed his nuclear deal with Iran. The tangible benefits of normalization to Israel would be few, and the risks to the Saudi government significant. Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, is engaged in a long-term project of reforming and modernizing his country in the face of fierce opposition from religious fundamentalists and members of his own royal family. Attempts to placate the Palestinians would make recognition of the “Zionist entity” by the cradle of Islam no less of an abomination to religious zealots. And the Palestinians have always refused to be placated.\nOne can almost imagine bin Salman colluding with Netanyahu to keep the bar to normalization unachievably high, precisely to avoid upending the productive status quo. But Trump needs a win, and facts are beside the point. The Palestinians have had a Jew-free state in all of Gaza since 2005. We know how that experiment turned out. And ending the Gaza war on Hamas’s terms, which have not meaningfully changed since they perpetrated the horrors of October 7, would simply start the countdown to the next pogrom. We have experimental evidence for that proposition as well: Israel is fighting its fifth war with Hamas, having allowed it to survive and thrive after each of the previous four.\nThese are merely facts, however, and Trump needs a win. We’ll see how far he’s willing to go to get it, how eager MBS is to cooperate, and how much fortitude Netanyahu is prepared to show in defending Israel’s core interests. Rumor has Trump preparing to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. The perfidy and self-defeating destructiveness of such a move can’t be overstated. But in a Machiavellian world of princes and winners, nothing is unthinkable."}

My name is Hallel, and I’m a liberal Zionist activist. I had a safe, legal abortion here in Israel two months ago. So yeah, we’re going to get into it—quickly and unapologetically.\nBecause lately, I’ve seen something deeply concerning: the way abortion rights are being linked with slogans like “Free Palestine” on protest signs, clinic doors, and Instagram carousels. At first glance, it might seem progressive, intersectional, or even brave to the average scroller. But let me be clear—it’s not just confusing. It’s harmful.\nAbortion Clinics Should Be Safe Spaces—Not Political Battlegrounds\nAbortion access is a human right. It’s a critical part of healthcare that must be safe, legal, and accessible to *everyone*. Clinics should be sanctuaries—places where women can make decisions about their bodies without fear, shame, or politicization.\nWhen you slap “Free Palestine” on the front of an abortion clinic, you’re not making that space more inclusive. You’re making it political. And politics—especially when they carry deeply divisive or weaponized rhetoric—have no place in a space meant to prioritize safety and bodily autonomy for all.\nBecause here’s the truth: Muslim women, Jewish women, Israeli women, Palestinian women, women of every identity and belief system—*all women*—need access to reproductive care. And when you politicize that access, you alienate some of the very people you claim to fight for.\nLet’s Talk About the Facts\nHere in Israel, abortion is legal. It’s safe. It’s accessible. There are committees, yes, but nearly all requests are approved. I’m living proof of that. I had access to the care I needed without shame or obstruction.\nUnder the Palestinian Authority? Under Hamas? That care doesn’t exist. Abortion is heavily restricted, if not outright illegal. There are no exceptions for rape. None for incest. None for fetal abnormalities. There’s almost no medical infrastructure, no systemic support. Women often resort to unsafe procedures—if they’re even able to find any option at all.\nSo when I see slogans like “Fund Abortion, Not War” or activists in red triangle t-shirts claiming solidarity with oppressed women by pushing a false narrative that erases the real conditions on the ground, it’s not just annoying. It’s dangerous.\nThat’s not solidarity.\nThat’s not activism.\nIt’s slacktivism.\nIt’s Western, Instagrammable, out-of-touch, and self-serving.\nMy Jewish Values Are Pro-Choice\nJudaism is clear: the life and health of the woman come first. Jewish law doesn’t just allow for abortion—it mandates it when the mother’s life is at risk. And in a world where women’s rights are constantly under siege, that clarity matters.\nI’m proud to say I accessed safe abortion care in the Jewish state. And I’m horrified that, during the same month, women across the United States were being denied that same right. That girls were bleeding out in hospital waiting rooms because doctors were too afraid to treat them. That people were watching their daughters suffer because saving them could cost a physician their license.\nSo if you really care about reproductive rights—about autonomy, about equity—then I ask you to pause. Reflect. And stop using abortion access as a backdrop for your unrelated political agenda.\nBecause no woman should feel unsafe walking into a clinic.\nNot because of protesters on the right screaming Bible verses—and not because of performative allies on the left projecting slogans that erase or distort complex realities.\nIf you want to support women’s rights? Start by making clinics safe again—for *everyone*. That includes Jews.\nAnd as for the rest of your gimmicks?\nThe tees. The slogans.\nThe lazy performance.\nYou can keep them.\nThey’re not helping anyone."}

It seems every ally, every so-called defender of Western values, is buckling under pressure and in doing so, siding, either directly or tacitly, with the very forces that committed one of the most heinous terrorist massacres in modern history on October 7th.\nLet’s be clear: Hamas is not a “resistance group.” It is a genocidal Islamist terrorist organization. The brutal slaughter of 1,200 innocent Israelis, families burned alive, children beheaded, women raped, should have been a moral line no civilized nation could ever cross. And yet, barely seventeen months later, the world has already forgotten. The victim is on trial, while the butchers are being humanized.\nTrump’s Silence and the Vanishing Red Line\nEven President Donald Trump, who stood by Israel so firmly in his first term, has now raised eyebrows by skipping a stop in Israel during his current trip through the Middle East. It’s an omission that speaks volumes, intentional or not. At a time when moral clarity is needed most, even the boldest voices seem to have gone quiet.\nSupporters hoped his second term would usher in renewed strength and unambiguous support for Israel’s right to self-defense. But silence now is not strength. It risks signaling to Israel’s enemies that even the strongest of allies can falter when the headlines grow uncomfortable.\nThe Netherlands: A Betrayal in Broad Daylight\nFew betrayals cut deeper than that of the Netherlands. A nation that initially stood by Israel in the aftermath of the October 7th massacre condemning Hamas, expressing solidarity, and affirming Israel’s right to respond has now done a complete reversal.\nThe Dutch government, under growing political and social pressure, has turned its back on Israel in the most public and humiliating way: condemning its military campaign in Gaza, calling for sanctions, and aligning itself with voices that have never once condemned Hamas with the same moral fervor. This is not neutrality. This is a knife in the back.\nDutch politicians who once expressed grief for Israeli victims now sit silently as mobs chant for intifada on the streets of Amsterdam. Instead of defending democracy and our shared values, they chase short-term popularity and surrender to populist outrage. The same Netherlands that speaks of tolerance and human rights now stands shoulder to shoulder with those who cheer for the annihilation of the Jewish state.\nEurovision’s Shame\nThe moral collapse of Europe is now on full display at the Eurovision Song Contest. The Israeli entry, a young woman and survivor of the October 7th massacre, faces vicious protests simply for existing. She’s not a soldier. She’s not a politician. She’s a singer. And yet, for daring to represent Israel, she is met with hostility, calls for bans, and organized boycotts. Where are the protests against Iran? Where is the outrage for the women imprisoned in Afghanistan? For the journalists tortured in Syria? For the children executed in Gaza by Hamas for suspected “collaboration”? The world’s fury is always selective and Israel is always the target.\nThe Ghosts of the 1940s\nWe’ve seen this before. In the 1930s and 40s, the world chose silence, delay, and business-as-usual with a growing Nazi regime. Warnings were ignored. Jews were demonized. Leaders looked away.\nNow, in 2025, we see the same pattern: appeasement of terror, moral relativism, and deafening silence from those who once vowed “never again.” The billions that now flow to regimes that fund terror like Qatar, Iran and others, echo the same complicity of the past. And once again, the Jewish people are told to wait, to restrain themselves, to stop fighting for their survival.\nThe Moment of Decision\nIf you believe in liberty, in democracy, in human dignity you must stand with Israel. Not only when it is convenient. Not only when it is safe. But especially when it is hard.\nThis is more than a war. It is a moral reckoning. And the nations of the West must decide whether they will stand with a fellow democracy under sieg or join the mob, hoping the fire never reaches their own doorstep.\nHistory will remember who stood up and who stayed silent."}

The conversation – and the larger one surrounding the Israeli-Gazan conflict – has had a stranglehold over Jewish-American discourse for the better part of two years. I girded myself for the usual talking points. You know the ones. But when the discussion started, my father suggested, almost off-handedly, Trump’s interventions wouldn’t have been necessary “if Jews weren’t such wimps.”\nI blinked.\n“…wimps?”\n“Weak,” he amended. “Y’know – pussies.”\nMy father was born in Far Rockaway, Queens in 1952. It was a more physical world. Activism was sweaty. It played out on the streets, not screens. When he was a teenager, he witnessed the rise of the Black Panthers, the political and community organization founded by Bobby Seale and Huey Newton in Oakland, California in 1966. The group was based on the notion that if you were going to mess with Black America, Black America would mess back. Members were armed to the teeth as they escorted their own down the block, protecting them from police. When the California State Assembly gathered to discuss the Mulford Act – a measure which would ban the public carrying of firearms – Seale and others stood on the Assembly steps, rifles at attention like spears.\n“Why can’t we do that?” my father asked me. “Why can’t there be Jewish Black Panthers?”\nNever mind the more problematic elements of the Panthers – the internal strife, the shootouts with police. What my father really suggested was a new Jewish physicality. A security not in words, but presence.\nWhen I attended the ADL conference in New York in March, I was struck by the pride on display. Israeli actress Gal Gadot headlined the closing ceremony, bringing many to tears with her rallying cry, “my name is Gal, and I am Jewish.” Jewish college students spoke of their fears on campus to many an “Am Yisrael Chai.” When I was interviewed by Jewish comedians Judy Gold and Hughie Stone Fish, they were insistent I take out my chai necklace and show it to the world. This pride was channeled into speaking out on socials, putting pressure on colleges and other institutions to review their security protocols, and generally shed light on the antisemitic experiences faced by so many each day.\nBut not once, during the entirety of the proceedings, was there a call to flood the campuses themselves – no thought that perhaps all the thousands in attendance would better flex their solidarity out there, on the streets, protecting their own, shoulder-to-shoulder. The fervor was left to evaporate. A boiling pool of frustration and fear, steamed off.\n“This is what they’re always accusing us of,” my father said. The they in question doesn’t matter. There’s always a they. “If someone gets in our face, we use the law. We use money. Very different from a ‘fuck you’ and punch to the teeth.”\nThe entire premise of my novel spirals round this idea. When our protagonist, Arthur, discovers he’s part of an ancient line of fantastical Jewish demon hunters, his first response isn’t excitement, but incredulity. “There’s something sexy about a demon-hunting priest,” he muses. “The righteous man of the collar hunting vampires and things that go bump in the night, armed only with his cross, his faith, and a precious vial of holy water. Yet you take that same religious man and call him a Rabbi, arm him with a shofar and Hebrew, and what was once a haunting tale turns comical in the telling.” Jews can’t be demon hunters because that’d mean they have to be cool first.\nThe current of Jewish emasculation runs deep. In his speech to the Second Zionist Congress in 1898, Max Nordau spoke of the need for a new “muscular Jew.” For too long, the Jews had held up a mirror to themselves and saw the reflection the world gave them: passive. Atrophied. We were once inheritors to the great strength of Samson and the Maccabees, but had gone soft. A new virility was needed. “We will develop wide chests, strong arms and legs,” Nordau said. “A brave look.” This, in contrast to the eydlkayt. The bleary-eyed scholar, gentle and wise. The pussy.\nThe Jewish story\nMuch has been made of the Jews as the “chosen people.” Critics use the phrase against us to suggest that we believe ourselves exalted over others. Rabbis have argued we are chosen not to rule, but that together with all people, facilitate a better tomorrow.\nI believe it’s not necessarily Jews, but the Jewish story that is chosen. More than science or faith, narrative is the best tool for meaning-making that all human beings have, and ours is one for the ages. Jewish struggles teach to love the stranger. Jewish triumphs are tales of resilience and hope. For thousands of years we have offered ourselves up as the great story in the hopes others might study it and be better for it. But in the wake of October 7th, many Jews no longer have a stomach for forbearance. We have put our faith in learning and in education, in letters. Yet fresh images of our dead children pile upon the old, and we wonder: why must it be their blood that teaches? Why must it be us on the stage, in the spotlight, our tragedies performed time after time as ritual for mankind?\nHistorically, American Jews have supported the Democratic Party and the ideas it espouses: diversity. Tolerance. Speaking truth to power. The old wisdom held it was these values in which we could take shelter. After all, protecting minorities included ourselves; we would only ever be as safe as our multicultural democracy. It’s not that we didn’t value security, or unity, or tradition, but that those who acted in their names historically did so at our expense. Which is why Trump’s recent crackdowns on collegiate antisemitism have cast a pall of ambivalence over American Jewry. For the first time, the sword of power swings down and it’s them, not us, under its shadow. Them the immigrant. Them the Muslim. And what’s more, the sword falls in our name.\nThe reversal intoxicates and terrifies us. A part of us cheers when our safety is made paramount. No diverse coalition. No hiding our needs behind universalism. This is our pain – ours – and we will end it ourselves. You mess with Jews, Jews mess back. We won’t wait until we’re dead for you to love us. We don’t need your love at all. We’re done asking for it.\nBut of course, we’re not ending the pain ourselves. Trump is. It’s not our sword, but his. Not our voice, our judgement. We are ceding it in the hopes that the blade will never turn on us, even when the others whispering in the president’s ear are antisemites. Are we so desperate to retch up our emasculation that we would arm the man who softened Jewish experiences during the Holocaust, who says nothing of sieg heils at his party convention or assumption of power, who tells us who is and isn’t one of our own? As Wesleyan University president Michael S. Roth recently opined, “these are our defenders?”\n“It isn’t good,” my father said.\n“What isn’t?” I asked.\n“The disappearing of these Hamas protestors. Swarming them on the street. No warrant. Throwing them down in Louisiana or wherever.”\nI agreed, but played devil’s advocate to coax more out. There’s some comfort in knowing a truth, but even more in hearing it echoed back to you.\n“Aren’t the President’s actions showing Jews mean business?” I suggested. “That we’re not wimps?”\nMy father shook his head.\n“If you’re playing ball and the other guy’s frustrating you, the solution isn’t to get the bully to steal the ball. Otherwise, the game’s up. Can’t change the rules of free speech or due process just to feel safer. That’s how Democracy itself goes down.”\n“Such sagely language, Dad,” I said. “Where’d you pick that wisdom up? Getting into scraps in Far Rockaway?”\nHe threw his hands behind his head.\n“Nah. I guess that came from shul.”"}

The message, worded in English and asking for help with a new initiative he’s trying to get off the ground, was polite and focused. The email was completely personalized, with no embarrassing linguistic errors or offers to share the inheritance of some Nigerian prince. I wasn’t asked for any personal details, there was no sense of artificial urgency about it, and it came in at a reasonable time of the day. It didn’t contain any content that was too good to be true. No one promised me a big prize or asked for a donation. It wasn’t even a “whaling” scam, in which someone pretends to be a senior manager in your organization and asks you for something. \nI replied politely that I’d be happy to help. A few days later, this individual asked that we switch to WhatsApp, and that didn’t seem odd to me either, because he gave me a UK phone number, and I understood that the individual in question lives there part of the time. I read a PDF he sent me with the plan for the initiative, and while it was fairly general, I could see that it was appropriate for someone with a bird’s-eye view of things. I sent him a voice message along those lines, and didn’t give it any more thought.\nThat was where things started to go wrong. A few days later, I traveled to a conference in New Delhi. There, I received a series of messages from the former director general, this time in Hebrew. He asked to schedule a conversation, and I wrote that because I would be in Delhi the entire week, I’d be happy to set a time for the beginning of the following week. He said that was fine, but that the meeting would be with his assistant in the United States. And then came the slam dunk giveaway: I was sent a link that I was asked to open from my computer, “for security reasons.” That was the “ah-ha” moment. At that point, I realized I had been taken in. Of course, I didn’t click on the link.\nBut I was unnerved. I was outside Israel, at an international conference, with no other Israelis. I realized that I had told a bad actor where I was, and had thus made myself even more vulnerable. I found myself looking around from time to time to check I wasn’t being followed. When an Indian hotel worker asked me in the elevator, “Is everything alright, ma’am?” I said it was, but when she asked what room I was staying in, I didn’t know whether to answer her. When I needed drinking water from room service, I was afraid to ask for it. Every taxi driver became a potential threat.\nI swallowed my pride and wrote to a good friend in Israel, an outstanding digital investigator. She asked to see screenshots of the correspondence and recommended that I block the number in question. I have to admit that I hadn’t thought to carry out even this simple action.\nI had fallen victim to a type of attack known as spear-phishing. In phishing, attackers send scam emails that contain links to malicious websites. Spear-phishing is focused on a specific target. If the context wasn’t as serious, I might even have been flattered, because whoever did this had to conduct in-depth research on the target, that is, on me.\nMy first question was: Who was after me? Was this a financial scam? Who wanted access to the contents of my computer? A quick Google search for “spear-phishing attack” in Hebrew revealed that in recent months, the Shin Bet had uncovered cyberattacks by Iran against senior figures in the defense establishment as well as politicians, academicians, and journalists. In each case, a suitable cover story had been fabricated and individually tailored. A Shin Bet official had commented that “the goal of this threat is assassination.” It was also reported that the Shin Bet had launched a large-scale operation to update and brief the relevant individuals. I, however, hadn’t been warned, and I soon realized I may never have an answer. \nThe deeply worrying part was that the spear-phisher’s approach was personally tailored to elicit a response from me. Recent research shows that spear-phishing attacks are responsible for 95% of successful hacking operations. This indicates a critical gap in cyber defenses, which focus primarily on technical protections and fail to address psychological vulnerabilities. Attackers use techniques that exploit frailties in the human psyche to bypass even the most secure technological defenses.\nPlaying on my desire to help\nSo, what were the frailties in my psyche, and despite my cyber expertise, that allowed the ruse to get as far as it did? My “root cause analysis” found no misuse of authority, because I didn’t get the email from my boss, nor was there an artificial sense of urgency that made me respond. Perhaps it was cognitive overload – I work at a fast pace with a high volume of correspondence. And here’s an uncomfortable truth: I don’t properly vet the address of every email I get, especially when there are no obvious red flags.\nEventually, I found the sign I should have clocked as being suspicious: The original email address contained a real name, the @ sign, and a real organization name, but then there was another @ followed by “proton.me.” Like gmail.com, this is a suffix belonging to an email service. But there’s a key difference: Gmail doesn’t allow addresses with a double @ sign, so as to prevent fraud like this, but Proton does, which is why it has become a useful and effective tool for attackers.\nBut it wasn’t simply that I had missed that technical red flag. It was, more than anything else, the way the attack played on my desire to help and to be involved. The email included a request for advice and for my professional opinion. When someone asks for a favor, the initial instinct is to want to say yes. This mutuality bias, along with a polite writing style and the allusion to a problem where my expertise could be of help, was precisely aligned with the kind of communication I would expect from someone like the supposed sender.\nLuckily for me, nothing happened in the real world: I didn’t hand over sensitive details, no one drained my bank account, and I wasn’t physically harmed. But I did experience hours of anxiety and stress. I couldn’t help thinking about the public implications: First, I didn’t know where to turn. Is there a support line for individuals in such cases? And if I were to contact it, would I be suspected of communicating with a foreign agent? \nSecond, there’s a need for psychological support to reframe these events and prevent targets from experiencing them with a sense of shame. And third, what should be done regarding the real person who was impersonated? I decided to call him. The conversation was embarrassing, especially when he asked, perhaps rightly, “How can I know that it’s really you, and that what you’re telling me is true?”\nUltimately, I have developed a set of assumptions about the world, about people. Did my belief in people’s basic decency act against me? And how can we lead our lives with immense wariness and suspicion while also maintaining our sense of trust in others? We can talk about education, awareness, and digital literacy to prevent these kinds of attacks, as I have spent decades doing, but the tools being used are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the damage to our sense of personal security is ever more painful.

Inside the holy confines of an Israeli synagogue, on the eve of Memorial Day — arguably the most sacred day on the national calendar  — Jews were not safe. The epidemic of hatred, which has seized Israel under the present government, literally shattered the windows.\nThe synagogue and the 80 people inside were targeted over the broadcast of a legal, long-standing, “alternative” memorial ceremony run by bereaved Israeli and Palestinian parents. It was not a random mob. The extremists were led by the head of the Likud’s local Ra’anana branch, Rachel Ben Ari Skaat, who boasted to the press: “This is just the opening shot.”\nThe mob claimed to be motivated by patriotism. If so, it is a particularly vile variety. It is ironic that these “patriots” found it more important to devote their hearts and minds on Memorial Day to confronting peace advocates than to honoring the memory of thousands of soldiers who have died for the country. If the goal had been merely to protest, then the incident would be only a reflection of their warped priorities. It would not constitute a crime or a threat to democracy. But they chose to break the law.\nVandalizing a synagogue, hurling firecrackers, and forcing the closure of the ceremony was not enough. The fleeing participants were then hunted down and physically attacked. Orly Erez-Likhovski, a human rights attorney and Executive Director of the Israel Religious Action Center, ended up in the emergency room after she and her car were pelted with stones.\nOn the one hand, the issue is no more complicated than any debate over freedom of expression in a democratic society. Any response needs to start with zero tolerance of violence and criminal prosecution against the thugs. As National Unity party chair Benny Gantz said this week in the Knesset: “There is absolutely no room for this sort of violence anywhere — especially not in a synagogue.”\nBut to me, the implications of last week’s mob attack are more sinister.\nSocietal progress takes time. It often starts when brave individuals see reality differently from the majority and have the temerity to share their alternative narrative. The new perspective diverges from society’s prevailing paradigms and generally purports to deliver a better outcome. Slowly but surely, the alternative outlook gains support until it becomes dominant. Israeli history and our country’s moral evolution are replete with such transitions.\nA majority of Israelis once held malevolent views about the legitimacy of homosexuality and the status of homosexuals. A small group of intrepid gay citizens suggested that there was another way of looking at sexuality. Over the years, the country came around to a new, healthier narrative about sexual preference.\nIn the case of the Alternative Memorial Day Service, it’s hard not to admire people on both sides of the conflict — Israelis and Palestinians — who have lost those who are dearest to them, and are still able to come together. They have found a way to get past their pain, anger, and impulse toward vengeance. Their call to live in harmony resonates as almost utopian.\nIf we can even detach for a minute from present exigencies and the heartache of October 7th and its aftermath, one thing should be clear: in the long run, if we are ever going to spare our children and grandchildren from a crushing destiny of forever “living by the sword,” this is a narrative that both sides eventually are going to have to embrace.\nThe problem for many of us, of course, is the timing. I believe that there exists a personal and collective need to mourn the tens of thousands of dedicated citizens, mostly young, who sacrificed their lives so that we might have the privilege of living in the State of Israel. For one day in the year, we should fully focus on our loss and fully embrace our solemn obligation to remember their sacrifice, without being confused by other aspirational agendas.\nOthers see it differently. Surely, those Israelis and Palestinians who hold a ceremony on Memorial Day that promotes their more conciliatory narrative, along with those around the country who identify and want to watch, are entitled to do so without fear of being assaulted.\nI understand that the Israeli police were caught by surprise, notwithstanding the massive social media buildup. I understand that on such a busy evening, only five officers could be assigned to the synagogue when police had to ensure the safety of numerous public ceremonies. But everything that happened was filmed. This was a premeditated attack that was well-organized and well-documented. We know who did it. Where are the arrests? Where are the indictments?\nI am not really surprised by the lack of a swift response from the Israeli police. After all, for some time, we have watched the complacency of Israeli cops in the face of intermittent violence against the local Arab population by a group of extremist Jews on the West Bank. The police are overseen by a racist minister of national security. This is the same Itamar Ben Gvir who once yelled at me during a Knesset speech that my praying as a Conservative Jew at the Western Wall was a greater provocation than Jewish prayer on the Temple Mount.\nI also have little expectation from a Likud party that long ago abandoned decency, dignity, and a commitment to the rule of law that Herut founders, Jabotinsky and Begin personified. The only thing that informed the party’s local party head was hatred and intolerance. Did anyone really believe that the Likud Chair, Prime Minister Netanyahu, who for some time has been a hostage to his increasingly extreme “base,” would condemn such lawlessness?\nBut I am very disappointed with the response of other political leaders. Take Ra’anana mayor, Haim Broide, who heads one of Israel’s most liberal cities. Broide released a pitiful Facebook post after the attack. He spends much of it defending his decision not to ban the screening of the alternative ceremony, because he regretably lacked the legal authority to do so. “Already last week, I was checking how to prevent provocative events in Ra’anana to preserve unity and public order.” Such a position constitutes an ideological justification for the hoodlums’ violence and an implicit disregard for freedom of expression for unpopular views.\nUnder these challenging circumstances, how should we respond to the Ra’ananah pogrom? To begin with, the police need to be forced to do their job. Initially, three of the rioters were arrested. The last time I checked, they had been released, and nothing had been done to expedite their indictment. Once again, we are reminded of how important an independent judiciary is. Legal action can force the police to make arrests and prosecute. Here, I trust that Israel’s civil society knows what must be done to force the police to enforce the law.\nAnd we still live in a democracy. We still have the ballot box. Ra’anana’s mayor has a very shaky majority in the city council. After such a moral failure, citizens in this progressive city need to demand that their representatives on the City Council seize control from a politician who has so little regard, not only for his city’s Reform Jewish community, but for anyone who dares to depart from national narratives and consensus.\nMost of all, we need to send this government and its right-wing, intolerant, incompetent members packing. Israel is a much better place than that small corner of Ra’anana where Jews were brazenly attacked last Tuesday evening. Israelis are much better than a vicious mob, committed to using force to shut down and injure people with whom they disagree.\nElections are on the way… sooner or later. Let’s ensure that Israel remains a country that not only tolerates alternative narratives but even gives them space to make their case."}

It’s the day our lives changed forever, when our youngest son was critically wounded in Lebanon. We’ve been on a long and winding road. Now that we’re home and life has slowed down, we finally have time to reflect on everything we’ve been through.\nIn some ways, it still feels surreal, like we’ve stepped into a different world, one that demands we carry invisible weight every single day.\nOur son appears fine on the outside. That’s what people see — a strong young man walking through the world with quiet determination. But the truth is more complicated. His wounds are internal — both physical and emotional. This past week was especially difficult. As Yom Hazikaron approached, so did the memories, the pain, the loss. Our son and three of his friends were all wounded together. Their injuries were severe, and for a time, each of them was teetering between life and death. One of their friends lost his life.\nThey went through some of the toughest moments of their lives together, and that kind of experience creates a lasting bond, one that now also carries the weight of grief. This year, as the nation remembered its fallen, they leaned on each other for support. But even in that connection, there’s a deep undercurrent of survivor’s guilt, a question that never fully fades: Why him and not me?\nOur son is fortunate in some ways. He has us, his family. He has those three friends who understand what he’s been through and who can support one another. But not all wounded soldiers have that kind of network. Some are alone. There are men and women like our son whose injuries are invisible — brain trauma, internal damage, emotional wounds — so their pain is harder to recognize.\nThe internal injuries our son sustained have taken a tremendous toll on his body. His systems no longer function as they once did. He lives with constant reminders that things are no longer the same. And then there are the emotional scars, the ones that don’t show up on scans or reports, but appear in sleepless nights, sudden silences, and the heaviness behind his eyes.\nWhen people see our son — walking, talking, even smiling — they assume he’s fine. But he’s not. He’s surviving. He’s rebuilding. That smile may be genuine in the moment, but it doesn’t erase the pain beneath it. Healing is a long, slow journey. There are no shortcuts. No switch you can flip to return to “normal.”\nSo I ask you, don’t assume. Don’t measure someone’s pain by what you can see. Just because someone looks okay doesn’t mean they are. Life is different now for our son, for us, and for all families of wounded soldiers. There is no going back. But there is moving forward, one step at a time with honesty, with compassion, and with the hope that people will begin to truly see what lies beneath the surface.\nWe just completed the tractate Makkot as part of the Daf Yomi cycle. The tractate ends with a poignant story. Rabbi Akiva stood among the ruins of the Beit HaMikdash. While the other Rabbis wept, Rabbi Akiva laughed, not because he didn’t feel the pain, but because he could see beyond it. He believed that just as the prophecy of destruction had come true, so too would the promise of rebuilding. His laughter was a form of hope, a quiet strength that looked past what was broken and held onto what could be. The tractate ends with the words: עֲקִיבָא נִיחַמְתָּנוּ, עֲקִיבָא נִיחַמְתָּנוּ — Akiva, you have comforted us; Akiva, you have comforted us.\nOur son and his friends remind me of that. They walk through the ruins of their old lives carrying wounds we cannot always see. But they keep going. They support one another. They laugh, even when it hurts. That kind of strength, the strength to keep moving, to believe in a future that looks nothing like the past, is what carries them forward.\nLike Rabbi Akiva, they choose to believe that something good still lies ahead. They do not view themselves as heroes, just as young people doing what they believe is right, helping to secure peace and bring our hostages home."}

That regret over the stories never told struck a special chord, particularly as both VE (Victory in Europe) Day and, in America, Mother’s Day, approached.\nDuring the war and afterwards, my mother was involved in US economic intelligence activities. Before her death, she dropped a few hints about what she did. It was only as I researched her life decades later, however, that some details emerged, even as large holes remained.\nOn May 9, 1945, Germany surrendered. Just two months later, my mom, a single woman a few weeks short of her 26th birthday, was granted the equivalent of the military rank of captain and sent to Germany to work with the US occupation government. Her parents, Yiddish-speaking Orthodox Jewish immigrants who’d come to America from Eastern Europe before the First World War, were not happy.\nCharlotte Katz Millenson was one of the super-sharp graduates of New York City’s Hunter College back when it was a women-only school whose free tuition was a magnet to families struggling during the Great Depression. When Charlotte’s parents moved to Washington, DC so her dad to could take over a laundry business, she soon followed.\nI interviewed my mom and dad a couple of years before her death in 1993, a time when her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease made it difficult to speak at length. She mentioned something about analyzing intercepted economic messages where she was working prior to going overseas. Her Civil Service records, which I found in my research, told a more dramatic story. The blandly named Foreign Economic Administration that she joined in 1944 was charged with analyzing thousands of intercepted German communications to help guide Allied bombing raids on economic targets.\nIn 1945, Charlotte transferred to the War Department as a civilian “financial reports specialist.” Shortly after, she was given a pay raise, a rank, a uniform and flown to Frankfurt on a military transport. While working there, she photographed a white building that was the Military Government’s headquarters and formerly housed the headquarters of chemical company IG Farben. It wasn’t widely known then that Farben made the Zyklon B gas used for mass murder in the concentration camps. I wonder what my mother thought later looking at that picture.\nIn January 1946, Charlotte was transferred to Berlin. It was in Berlin that she participated in the interrogation of Albert Speer, the man Adolf Hitler appointed to oversee German’s wartime economy. That interrogation, my research showed, was part of a confidential US project designed both to evaluate the effectiveness of the Allied bombing and to gather German industrial secrets before the Russians could obtain them.\nWhat was it like for Charlotte to come face-to-face with Hitler’s Minister of Armaments and War, knowing the massive destruction wreaked by those armaments? What questions was she allowed to ask? Meanwhile, there’s a photo of my mom posing with a Russian soldier, his left arm around her shoulder, both smiling, as he guarded the ruins of the bunker where Hitler committed suicide days before the war’s end. What were her feelings standing at the entrance to the Führerbunker, literally walking in Hitler’s footsteps? One more untold story. And there were others.\nThough I obviously can’t know for sure why my mom didn’t speak more and in more detail about her experiences, I have some guesses. There was, naturally, the confidentiality component, even years later. Moreover, my mom was often reticent to talk too much about herself; my dad was more the raconteur.\nBut I also think there may have been more personal reasons. After the war, it took Charlotte a while to land a job that wasn’t secretarial. Then, after a few years as a junior economist at the World Bank, she met my father, got married and had my sister, brother and me. Her full-time job became raising three smart, verbal, difficult children on the modest salary of a husband working for the government and a non-profit. It was by no means easy. She did it well and with love. Yet part of her, I think now, remained frustrated. One reason Charlotte may have been reluctant to share more stories about her experiences may have been because of the memories they conjured at a time when “housewife” was the only role she could play.\nIn  the song “Free Man in Paris,” Joni Mitchell sings: “I was a free man in Paris, I felt unfettered and alive.” My mom was, indeed, free in Paris, visiting there twice with friends, and, as a surviving letter to her mom shows, did feel “unfettered and alive,” as the song put it. It was the same in Germany. As Atina Grossman writes in the book Jews, Germans and Allies: Close Encounters in Occupied Germany, for the young men and women in the Military Government, this was “the great adventure of their lives.” Enjoying the benefits of dominance and affluence in a defeated nation, there were dates and parties, “drinking and playing and romancing.”\nI value what I uncovered about Charlotte as an intelligence analyst, and, like those interviewed in the documentary series, wish I’d known more. Had there been more time ­– if she hadn’t fallen ill, if we had reached the point in our lives where we knew better what to ask and how to listen – it might have been different. But the influence that continues to resonate throughout my life is from the love that came from Charlotte Katz Millenson, mom."}

The Houthi missile impacted in a grove of trees alongside an access road close to Terminal 3, several hundred yards from the airport control tower.\n“We are facing a situation where a missile that fell in Ben Gurion Airport could have just as easily fallen a little bit to the left or the right and could have hit an aircraft or a terminal, and that could have had a catastrophic effect,” Adv. Shirly Kazir, head of aviation & tourism practices at law firm FISCHER (FBC) told The Times of Israel. “So foreign airlines are obviously fearful, but even if airlines are willing to consider resuming flights to Israel when the situation calms down a bit, safety and the issue of pricing of insurance premiums come up once again.”\nKazir, who represents 20 foreign airlines operating in Europe and the US, said that the carriers want to resume flight services to Tel Aviv, but for that to happen, they will need more certainty and flexibility on the regulatory situation in Israel to ease costs and financial risk if they have to halt operations again because of the security situation.\nSign up for the Tech Israel Daily\nand never miss Israel's top tech stories\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“If it’s important for Israel to have the asset of foreign airlines flying to Israel, there are solutions the Transportation Ministry can advance that wouldn’t be too costly and that could make a shift in the airlines’ decision,” said Kazir, who has been representing foreign airlines in a proposal to make amendments to the 2012 Aviation Services Law, which protects consumer rights of passengers whose flights have been canceled.\nSmoke in the area of Ben Gurion Airport after a ballistic missile was fired at Israel from Yemen on May 4, 2025 (Screen grab from social media used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)\nAfter the rocket impact near the airport — which followed failed Israeli and American attempts to shoot it down — the Houthis boasted of their success and claimed that Ben Gurion Airport was “no longer safe for air travel.” The Yemen-based terror group threatened to “blockade” Israel’s airspace.\n“The fact that a missile managed to infiltrate and hit around Ben Gurion Airport caused a lot of concern,” said Eyal Doron, partner and head of the aviation department at law firm S. Horowitz & Co. “Had it fallen someplace else, far away from the airport for example, in an open area in the Negev desert, I’m not sure it would have caused such substantive material reaction by foreign airlines.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nInitially, many foreign carriers suspended flights to Israel for short periods of a day or two, while monitoring the situation daily. But by the end of last week, the list of airlines deciding to stay away for longer expanded. Some foreign airlines are postponing their return for weeks or months and, in some cases, indefinitely.\nIn response, the Transportation Ministry said that the government and aviation authorities are continuously working with foreign airlines to bring them back and restore flight services.\nAs of now, the Lufthansa Group — which includes German carrier Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, and Eurowings — has said it will not resume flights to Tel Aviv until May 19. Air India, which operates a direct route between Israel and India, has suspended flights until May 25. US carriers United and Delta airlines have halted flights until May 18 and May 20 respectively. Iberia will not resume flights until June 1, and British Airways not until June 15.\nAmong low-cost airlines, Wizz Air canceled flights until May 14, and Ryanair until May 21. UK carrier Virgin Atlantic at the end of April ceased direct flight services between London and Tel Aviv, after previously pausing the route amid the war.\nAccording to Kazir and Doron, recent flight suspensions by foreign airlines are based on similar considerations that have guided them throughout the war: safety considerations, risk management, insurance policy coverage and the refusal of flight crews to fly to Israel. They both cautioned that many foreign airlines halting their flight services will divert aircraft destined for Tel Aviv to other places, making it harder to resume service.\nAdv. Shirly Kazir, head of aviation & tourism practices at the FISCHER (FBC) law firm. (Courtesy of Ofir Abe)\n“If foreign airlines take their aircraft to a new route and a different destination, the chances of us getting them back for the summer period now are very low,” said Kazir. “Many clients I have, meaning foreign airlines, advise me in confidence that they are not resuming flights to Israel until the summer, which is horrific.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nMany of the airlines had only recently resumed services to Israel after they were canceled for much of the time since Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023, that started the war in Gaza. United had resumed flights in March, while Delta returned on April 1, and British Airways restarted its Israel flights on April 5.\n“Foreign airlines would like to fly to Israel, especially from a business point of view, as they’ve sold tickets [and] they don’t want August 2024 to happen again, faced with a situation where they have to deal with refunds and might again be sued by passengers,” said Doron.\n“Under the current situation, when nothing is clear, as we do not know what’s going to happen even next week, the State of Israel needs to convince foreign airlines that its airspace is safe, the airport is safe, and what happened a week ago was a very exceptional issue… No system is perfect, no system can give you 100% protection,” she said.\nWith foreign carriers absent, the supply of flights low and demand high, ticket prices will surge again, Doron and Kazir warned. Of the dozens of foreign airlines that dominated the local aviation market before the outbreak of war in Gaza, primarily Israeli carriers have maintained regular flight schedules amid the war. In recent days, Emirates, Abu Dhabi’s Etihad, and flydubai also continued flying despite the Houthi attack.\n“As foreign airlines cancel a flight, they already lose money because they can’t reallocate the airplane immediately, and then they have to refund passengers for the cost of the tickets or try to reroute them at a much higher cost — a monetary exposure they have faced throughout the war,” said Doron.\n“Many foreign airlines only resumed their Israel services in March, to end up in a situation where a couple of weeks later, flights are being canceled again, and they are again hit with ticket refunds and compensation. It’s not sustainable for a long time.”\nShe warned that “if the disruptions go on for a long time, my concern is that some airlines could decide that they are not coming back.”\nEarlier this year, Israeli lawmakers agreed to make legal changes to canceled flight compensation rights for air passengers to help ease the financial costs of disruptions to foreign carriers during the war period. The Knesset Economics Committee approved a proposal by foreign airlines to make amendments to the 2012 Aviation Services Law, which will restrict the terms and conditions of compensation paid by airlines to passengers in the event of flight cancellations during an emergency war period. The legal amendment was passed in a second and third reading in the Knesset in February.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDepending on the security situation, the Transportation Ministry, in consultation with the Economy Ministry, will be given the power and authority to temporarily suspend some of the compensation entitlements of consumers, such as limiting the obligation to provide accommodation in the event of a flight cancellation for up to two nights.\nAdv. Eyal Doron, partner and head of the aviation department at law firm S. Horowitz & Co. (Courtesy)\n“If foreign airlines [knew] that they have that flexibility from the Israeli regulation, it would give them more comfort to resume flight services, but for that to kick in, Israel needs to declare a special emergency situation,” said Kazir.\n“Foreign airlines want to know that they don’t sell flight tickets for ‘X’ amount, and then, in the case of cancellations, have to pay 10 times ‘X’.”\nDuring an emergency period, an airline that cancels all of its flights will also have options to offer passengers an alternative ticket, either from a different point of departure or to a different nearby destination such as Larnaca or Athens.\n“Airlines want to know that if they are not flying to Israel because of the security situation, they can bring passengers to nearby Cyprus or Greece instead of being exposed to massive costs that they would have to pay — to mostly Israeli airlines — to get passengers to their final destination in Tel Aviv,” said Kazir."}

Tamar holds some 10 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of natural gas, half of the quantity held in Leviathan.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsrael has been exporting gas from the Tamar field to Jordan since January 2017, and the Leviathan field started exports to Egypt in January 2020. The Leviathan deals are considered to be bigger and more significant for the economy.\nAmid the ongoing war with the Hamas terror group in Gaza, natural gas exports to Egypt and Jordan increased by more than 13% in 2024 year-on-year. Overall, natural gas production was up 8.3% in 2024, and state revenue collected from gas royalties soared almost 11% to NIS 2.37 billion ($670 million).\nIn June 2022, Israel, Egypt and the European Union signed a memorandum of understanding that will see Israel export its natural gas to the bloc for the first time. According to the agreement, Israeli gas will be supplied via Egypt’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants to the European Union.\nIn the report, the finance ministry’s budget department also warned about the high concentration in the local gas market, citing the cross-ownership of US energy giant Chevron in Israel’s largest gas reservoirs. Chevron operates and holds a 25% stake in the Tamar gas field, and a 39.66% stake in the Leviathan gas reservoir.\nWorkers on the Israeli ‘Tamar’ gas processing rig, 24 km off the Israeli southern coast of Ashkelon. (Moshe Shai/FLASH90)\n“This concentration poses a risk to price levels, energy security and the long-term competitiveness of the economy,” according to the position paper. “Putting the operations of essential gas infrastructure in the hands of a single entity, without a substantial competitive alternative, creates a captive market in which consumers have no real ability to negotiate or secure fair prices over time.”\n“This concentration could lead in the near term to an increase in gas prices and, as a result, lead to higher electricity prices,” it added.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn the position paper, the ministry called on the government to take structural steps to reduce concentration in the domestic gas market.\nOne of the recommendations is to consider, from 2030, limiting holdings to no more than one rig that produces gas in Israel, if these holdings constitute more than 80% of the gas reserves in the economy.\nIn response, the Energy Ministry said that it seeks to “secure the supply of natural gas to the economy at the lowest price, and the right way to do this is through the discovery of additional reserves, the entry of new international companies, and creating competition.”\n“We are closely monitoring natural gas prices in the Israeli economy and we will use all the tools at our disposal to secure price levels without being dragged into the misguided steps put forward by the Finance Ministry, that will drive away international companies, prevent the discovery of new reserves and result in price increases,” the Energy Ministry said. “Unfortunately, the position paper is not in line with reality and does not take into account recently signed contracts.”\n“Similarly, predictions about an expected shortage of natural gas are unfounded and create unnecessary panic,” the ministry said."}

Koeltl, who said a substantial term in prison was necessary for someone who engaged in “extremely serious” crimes that enabled him to pocket over $45 million while some of his customers lost everything and suffered severe psychological harm.\nCelsius declared bankruptcy in 2022, exposing risky financial bets Mashinsky had made with some of the $20 billion that thousands of customers poured into the company. He had promised that their money would be safe and secure at Celsius, which pitched itself as a modern-day bank where crypto assets could earn interest.\nThe defense blamed the collapse of Celsius on a “cataclysmic downturn” of cryptocurrency markets in May and June of 2022 and said in court papers that Mashinsky’s “actions were never predatory, exploitative or venal.

Those products, many of which are developed in China or other countries subject to heavy tariffs, will likely become more expensive, increasing infrastructure costs and making the Israeli products more costly.\nThe companies also use products like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. If those companies increase their costs due to the tariffs, those expenses will also affect Israeli firms’ bottom line, said Franklin, who has been based in New York for 13 years.\nThe economic uncertainty wrought by the tariffs impacts the companies by shaking investor confidence. The Israeli financial tech company eToro, for example, delayed its planned initial public offering in the US earlier this month due to market volatility.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“You see a real impact on companies and their plans to go and raise money. One example is eToro, which postponed its planned IPO due to the market conditions and uncertainty,” Franklin said.\n“For the publicly traded tech companies, they’re currently strapped into the public markets rollercoaster,” Kaplowitz said. The startup community will be hit hardest if investors have fewer funds, or less appetite for high-risk, early-stage investing, he added.\nAmir Zilberstein, an Israeli investor in New York with the Team8 venture capital firm, said some companies had slowed down operations while they wait to see how the tariffs play out. He estimated that 70% of Israel’s high-tech exports are software and services. In fields like cybersecurity, ” I cannot see any direct effect. There’s hardly any hardware involved,” he said.\nHe cautioned that it was too early to tell what the end results will be.\n“It’s a complex plan and it’s going to take time to implement, and even when they’re going to finish implementing, it is going to take time to see the consequences,” Zilberstein said.\nThere is also a grey area regarding what constitutes an Israeli company in the US. Some firms are based in Israel but have offices in the US, and others are headquartered in the US but conduct research and development in Israel, for example. Israelis living in the US also found businesses, such as restaurants, that are not directly tied to Israel or the tech industry. Each company, depending on its structure, will be affected by the tariffs in a different way.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe tariffs could also present opportunities for Israeli tech companies. Investors might prefer deploying capital for longer-term investments, especially in software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies that have more limited exposure to the tariffs and market dynamics, Kaplowitz said. The tariffs will also distance the US from China as a trading partner, creating an opening that Israeli companies could fill with exports, he said.\nZilberstein said that the differing tariff rates could present advantages if Israel has a lower tariff rate than other countries, but “it’s hard to predict anything,” he said. Negotiations could further lower Israel’s tariff rate, for example, but the Trump administration could also remove the exclusions for software. The eventual policies could end up being minor, or momentous, he said.\n“If there are going to be significant changes and the market will believe that they’re here to stay, then we will for sure see shifts,” he said.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, left, speaks alongside US President Donald Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on April 7, 2025. (Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images via AFP)\nThe Trump administration’s visa policies are also not a major factor for the companies. Usually, Israeli founders move to the US on an L-1 visa, then hire American employees, while uncertainty has largely revolved around H-1B visas. Many founders have also moved to New York since the start of the war because the lack of flights made it difficult and expensive to travel back and forth between the two countries, Franklin said.\nLast week, the Israel Innovation Authority said that in the first nine months of Israel’s war with the Hamas terror group, 8,300 tech employees left the country and relocated for a year or more, or about 2.1 percent of the local high-tech workforce. The report also said the number of workers in Israel’s tech workforce declined last year for the first time in at least a decade, sparking fears of brain drain and lost tax revenue in Israel’s crucial tech sector. The report did not specify which countries the workers moved to.\n“The brain-drain issue, which has long impacted Israeli tech, could pose a major threat to the start-up ecosystem in Israel,” Kaplowitz said. “It could lead to more US-based jobs, although it’s important to note that studies have shown that trade creates more jobs than foreign direct investment.”\nIsrael had hoped to avoid US President Donald Trump’s sweeping decree to impose levies on global imports announced this month. Instead, it was hit with a 17% tariff despite lifting all remaining duties on US imports in a last-minute attempt to be spared.\nThere are more than 400 Israeli startups in New York City, according to Israeli Mapped in NY. Some of the leading fields include cybersecurity, financial tech and business software. New York is home to around 30 Israel-founded unicorns, or businesses worth at least $1 billion, second in the US to California, with 35 unicorns, according to the US-Israel Business Alliance."}

The message, worded in English and asking for help with a new initiative he’s trying to get off the ground, was polite and focused. The email was completely personalized, with no embarrassing linguistic errors or offers to share the inheritance of some Nigerian prince. I wasn’t asked for any personal details, there was no sense of artificial urgency about it, and it came in at a reasonable time of the day. It didn’t contain any content that was too good to be true. No one promised me a big prize or asked for a donation. It wasn’t even a “whaling” scam, in which someone pretends to be a senior manager in your organization and asks you for something. \nI replied politely that I’d be happy to help. A few days later, this individual asked that we switch to WhatsApp, and that didn’t seem odd to me either, because he gave me a UK phone number, and I understood that the individual in question lives there part of the time. I read a PDF he sent me with the plan for the initiative, and while it was fairly general, I could see that it was appropriate for someone with a bird’s-eye view of things. I sent him a voice message along those lines, and didn’t give it any more thought.\nThat was where things started to go wrong. A few days later, I traveled to a conference in New Delhi. There, I received a series of messages from the former director general, this time in Hebrew. He asked to schedule a conversation, and I wrote that because I would be in Delhi the entire week, I’d be happy to set a time for the beginning of the following week. He said that was fine, but that the meeting would be with his assistant in the United States. And then came the slam dunk giveaway: I was sent a link that I was asked to open from my computer, “for security reasons.” That was the “ah-ha” moment. At that point, I realized I had been taken in. Of course, I didn’t click on the link.\nBut I was unnerved. I was outside Israel, at an international conference, with no other Israelis. I realized that I had told a bad actor where I was, and had thus made myself even more vulnerable. I found myself looking around from time to time to check I wasn’t being followed. When an Indian hotel worker asked me in the elevator, “Is everything alright, ma’am?” I said it was, but when she asked what room I was staying in, I didn’t know whether to answer her. When I needed drinking water from room service, I was afraid to ask for it. Every taxi driver became a potential threat.\nI swallowed my pride and wrote to a good friend in Israel, an outstanding digital investigator. She asked to see screenshots of the correspondence and recommended that I block the number in question. I have to admit that I hadn’t thought to carry out even this simple action.\nI had fallen victim to a type of attack known as spear-phishing. In phishing, attackers send scam emails that contain links to malicious websites. Spear-phishing is focused on a specific target. If the context wasn’t as serious, I might even have been flattered, because whoever did this had to conduct in-depth research on the target, that is, on me.\nMy first question was: Who was after me? Was this a financial scam? Who wanted access to the contents of my computer? A quick Google search for “spear-phishing attack” in Hebrew revealed that in recent months, the Shin Bet had uncovered cyberattacks by Iran against senior figures in the defense establishment as well as politicians, academicians, and journalists. In each case, a suitable cover story had been fabricated and individually tailored. A Shin Bet official had commented that “the goal of this threat is assassination.” It was also reported that the Shin Bet had launched a large-scale operation to update and brief the relevant individuals. I, however, hadn’t been warned, and I soon realized I may never have an answer. \nThe deeply worrying part was that the spear-phisher’s approach was personally tailored to elicit a response from me. Recent research shows that spear-phishing attacks are responsible for 95% of successful hacking operations. This indicates a critical gap in cyber defenses, which focus primarily on technical protections and fail to address psychological vulnerabilities. Attackers use techniques that exploit frailties in the human psyche to bypass even the most secure technological defenses.\nPlaying on my desire to help\nSo, what were the frailties in my psyche, and despite my cyber expertise, that allowed the ruse to get as far as it did? My “root cause analysis” found no misuse of authority, because I didn’t get the email from my boss, nor was there an artificial sense of urgency that made me respond. Perhaps it was cognitive overload – I work at a fast pace with a high volume of correspondence. And here’s an uncomfortable truth: I don’t properly vet the address of every email I get, especially when there are no obvious red flags.\nEventually, I found the sign I should have clocked as being suspicious: The original email address contained a real name, the @ sign, and a real organization name, but then there was another @ followed by “proton.me.” Like gmail.com, this is a suffix belonging to an email service. But there’s a key difference: Gmail doesn’t allow addresses with a double @ sign, so as to prevent fraud like this, but Proton does, which is why it has become a useful and effective tool for attackers.\nBut it wasn’t simply that I had missed that technical red flag. It was, more than anything else, the way the attack played on my desire to help and to be involved. The email included a request for advice and for my professional opinion. When someone asks for a favor, the initial instinct is to want to say yes. This mutuality bias, along with a polite writing style and the allusion to a problem where my expertise could be of help, was precisely aligned with the kind of communication I would expect from someone like the supposed sender.\nLuckily for me, nothing happened in the real world: I didn’t hand over sensitive details, no one drained my bank account, and I wasn’t physically harmed. But I did experience hours of anxiety and stress. I couldn’t help thinking about the public implications: First, I didn’t know where to turn. Is there a support line for individuals in such cases? And if I were to contact it, would I be suspected of communicating with a foreign agent? \nSecond, there’s a need for psychological support to reframe these events and prevent targets from experiencing them with a sense of shame. And third, what should be done regarding the real person who was impersonated? I decided to call him. The conversation was embarrassing, especially when he asked, perhaps rightly, “How can I know that it’s really you, and that what you’re telling me is true?”\nUltimately, I have developed a set of assumptions about the world, about people. Did my belief in people’s basic decency act against me? And how can we lead our lives with immense wariness and suspicion while also maintaining our sense of trust in others? We can talk about education, awareness, and digital literacy to prevent these kinds of attacks, as I have spent decades doing, but the tools being used are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the damage to our sense of personal security is ever more painful.

Glancing ahead, though, they warn that the challenges in sustaining the foundations of the tech sector — the economy’s beating heart — are piling up.\n“Israel’s innovation economy stands at a critical juncture after more than 18 months of war, which tested the entire ecosystem — infrastructure, capital, talent and trust,” said Startup Nation Central CEO Avi Hasson. Startup Nation Central is a nonprofit that promotes Israel’s tech ecosystem.\n“Israeli tech has proven its strength and resilience, but the next phase will require more than resilience. It will demand strategic action — talent development, sector diversification and alignment between innovation and national priorities,” Hasson said.\nOver the last 19 months, Israeli startups have been grappling with the ongoing callup of employees to perform reserve duty, staff shortages, and funding woes amid the continued uncertainty about the duration and extent of the war, which broke out after Hamas-led terrorists invaded southern Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7, 2023, massacring some 1,200 people and kidnapping 251.\nSign up for the Tech Israel Daily\nand never miss Israel's top tech stories\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nIsrael’s economy grew by around 1% in 2024, down from 1.8% in 2023 and 6.3% in 2022, before the outbreak of the war with Hamas. The growth rate last year surpassed forecasts even as the fighting with Hamas and the Iran-backed Hezbollah group led to increased government spending on military and civilian needs and took a toll on exports and investments.\nTech workers march in Tel Aviv to protest against the government’s planned overhaul of the judicial system, January 31, 2023. (Tomer Neuberg/Flash90)\nOne of the key reasons for this is that the nation’s tech economy has continued to lure foreign investors despite local entrepreneurs registering their companies abroad and many firms moving part of their workforce outside the country. Similarly, the economy quickly recovered from the worst recession ever, wrought by the deadly COVID-19 pandemic, with the booming tech industry leading the charge.\n“The tech industry has managed to stay and is still the most attractive part of the Israeli economy, as most of the capital inflows for investment are in tech,” said Ian Rostowsky, co-head of the hi-tech and venture capital practice at law firm Amit, Pollak, Matalon & Co. “Israel has a mature high tech ecosystem, more than most other countries, but when we talk about independence, it is clear that the high-tech ecosystem is not independent in the sense that it can be standalone and survive without foreign investment.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“One of the main worries is that the international perception of Israel is very negative as the war interrupts everything,” warned the South African-born Rostowsky. “Although Israel has done relatively well despite the negative headwinds, they are significant and are becoming more and more difficult if the situation continues and leads to a larger outflow of companies relocating outside of Israel, some of it happening at the demand of investors.”\nIn a year during which Israel faced one of the longest and most intense wars in its history and levels of geopolitical uncertainty have been off the charts, the tech industry racked up $13.4 billion in merger and acquisition deals in 2024, up from $7.5 billion in 2023 though a far cry from the $82 billion high recorded in 2021.\nUS chipmaker Nvidia spent almost $1 billion to buy two Israeli startups: Israeli AI startup Deci for about $300 million and local startup Run:ai, for about $700 million. Run:ai is Nvidia’s biggest acquisition in Israel since it bought Mellanox Technologies Ltd. in 2020 for $6.9 billion.\nAdv. Ian Rostowsky co-head of the hi-tech and venture capital practice at law firm Amit, Pollak, Matalon & Co. (Courtesy)\nSan Francisco-based software giant Salesforce also scored two big deals in Israel with the acquisition of Own, an Israeli data backup startup, for $1.9 billion and local data management startup Zoomin for $450 million. Other notable mega deals that closed this year are Blackstone acquiring Priority Software for $800 million and Johnson & Johnson buying V-Wave.\nOn top of that, this year saw the biggest buyout in the country’s history as Google’s parent company, Alphabet, agreed to snap up Israeli-founded cybersecurity unicorn Wiz in an all-cash deal for a staggering $32 billion. The mega deal is estimated to generate $4 billion in taxes, which will flow into national coffers.\nIn the shadow of the war, Israeli tech companies raised $10.6 billion in fresh capital in 2024, according to data by Startup Nation Central. In the first quarter of 2025, private funding generated $3.2 billion for investment into local tech companies.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“What comes to mind when I think of Independence Day and what Israeli tech has achieved in 77 years is a sense of great pride,” said Yonatan Sela, an Israel-based partner at Australian venture capital fund Square Peg. “The Wiz deal is just the icing on the cake but it doesn’t come in a vacuum.”\n“It comes out of an ecosystem that is thriving with a lot of foundation: a VC ecosystem built over the years that supports companies from the early stages, great innovation, and one big breathing organism with many parts that supports and fuels each other, inspires each other, finances each other, and hires each other,” Sela said.\nSquare Peg, with $3.3 billion in assets under management, has been active in Israel for more than a decade and has since invested $400 million in local startups and tech companies, including Deci (bought by Nvidia), Exodigo, and Qodo.\n“The war hurt the Israel brand. Especially during the first year, until we made military achievements as a country, there were a lot of headwinds,” said Sela. “Since the beeper operation and everything that followed, we see regained recognition of Israeli technology, intelligence, and other capabilities luring foreign investors, especially American funds, which entered the local market during the past year more aggressively than before.”\n“Investors understand that as a tech hub, Israel is among the world’s top three hubs, and that hasn’t changed — what offsets it a bit is that for some investment bodies, and especially European investment funds and some Asian investment funds, it’s been more challenging to get Israeli investments approved because Israel is at war,” he said.\nYonatan Sela, partner at Australian venture capital fund Square Peg. (Courtesy)\nIn Israel’s tech ecosystem, startups are the lifeblood of future mergers and acquisitions, tax income, and employment creation. Tech employees pay more than a third of all tax income collected, which underpins the vital importance of the sector as a key driver for the recovery of an economy that has been stumbling through the repercussions of 19 months of war.\nThe economy’s dependence on the tech sector has significantly grown in the past decade, driven by rapid growth in tax revenues from the sector, led by an increase in the number of employees and rising salaries.\nThe tech industry last year contributed 20% to local GDP, versus 6.2% in 1995. It also made up more than 50% of total exports. Tech employees account for about 11.4% of the workforce.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBoth Sela and Rostowsky cautioned that the still impressive fundraising and M&A figures achieved during this difficult war period are marred by a number of worrying trends and challenges that have only increased during the past few months as attempts to revive the protested judicial overhaul resurfaced.\n“Over the years, many Israeli entrepreneurs and founders have succeeded in growing valuable companies and are becoming more skillful in managing large companies to sell them, but many like Wiz are registered in Delaware and not in Israel, which is unfortunate because they are paying taxes elsewhere,” said Rostowsky. “In Israel, for every success, there are a lot of companies that didn’t manage to raise enough financing, and have reduced their operations significantly, were closed down, or were sold for relatively small amounts during the challenging war period.”\nHe added, “Some multinational companies have scaled back or even closed their Israeli operations because of the war and amid growing internal political instability.”\nSela cautioned that starting with the proposed judicial overhaul in January 2023, local companies “felt insecure and started to move their incorporation outside of Israel, and that has intensified by the war.”\n“Would it be better if companies were incorporated in Israel and felt safe to do it here? Yes, but I don’t think that will be the case in the next few years,” Sela said. “The biggest question in that regard is where the talent is going to want to live and whether this country will be a place where Israeli entrepreneurs like the Wiz founders will want to do business.”\nLeft: Founders of US-Israeli cyber unicorn Wiz (from left to right): VP Product Yinon Costica, CEO Assaf Rappaport, CTO Ami Luttwak, and VP R&D Roy Reznik.

(JHVEPhoto/iStock)\nFrom the beginning of the war until July 2024, the number of tech employees who departed Israel for long-term relocation increased and stood at about 8,300 people, or about 2.1% of the local tech workforce.\n“If this trend is going to continue — whether it’s for economic incentives, imbalance in the burden of serving in the military, or the feeling that the justice system is going to turn to be something less predictable — then we are going to see more and more people not come back from either relocations or academic studies abroad and slowly but surely this drip of talent will grow,” said Sela.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRostowsky urged the government to play a significant role in seeing that the ecosystem remains attractive by offering tax incentives or additional grants for Israeli companies.\n“It’s up to us as a country and for the government to ensure that in the long term, the talent continues to feel very welcome in Israel,” said Sela. “At the end of the day, that’s what’s going to define the strength of the Israeli tech ecosystem and whether companies will remain and work here.”"}

Faced with higher meat prices, they were feeling the pinch in their pockets at a time when many households are already contending with the rising costs of goods and are struggling to make ends meet in the shadow of the war.\nStarting Wednesday after sunset and continuing on Thursday, tens of thousands of Israeli families will celebrate the country’s 77th birthday by participating in the Jewish state’s national pastime: charcoal grilling. Though heavily affected by the wildfires raging in the country’s center this year and a consequent nationwide ban on lighting fires in public areas, many were set to barbecue in their backyards or on their balconies.\nOver the past year, meat prices in Israel continued to rise by an average of 2 % to almost 10% due to import trends, changes in local regulations, and global market influences, according to data and market trends collated and analyzed by non-bank credit provider Ultra Finance. The firm provides tailored funding solutions to thousands of businesses and enterprises, including the food sector.\nFor example, the price of entrecote rose from NIS 145.7 ($40.21) per kilogram in April 2024 to NIS 152 ($42) per kg in 2025 – an increase of about 4 percent. Fresh chicken breast climbed from NIS 38.6 ($10.64) to NIS 42 ($11.59) per kg – an increase of about 9%. The price of chicken thighs is about 3% higher, rising more moderately, from NIS 60 $16.56) to NIS 62 ($17.11) per kg year-on-year. According to Consumer Price Index data for March 2025, frozen beef prices rose by 1.6%, poultry by 1.4%, and lamb by 1.1%.\n“A comparison between supermarket chains and butcher shops illustrates the gap: In the chains, meat prices are tens of percent lower, but private butcher shops continue to attract customers thanks to high quality and personal service,” said Ultra Finance analyst Roy Lengy. “Surveys show that many Israelis are willing to pay more at butcher shops for fresh meat cuts, quality, and a personal service atmosphere, which explains their continued popularity despite the high prices.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nUltra Finance’s report is based on a combination of proprietary data analysis, insights from the company’s financing activities with businesses across the food sector, and a review of publicly available market research.\nIllustrative: Sides of beef and grilled veggies at an Israeli cowboys’ BBQ at Bat Yaar Ranch in the Biriya Forest in northern Israel. (Haim Azulay/Flash 90)\nDuring Independence Day week, there is a threefold increase in the amount of meat and other products bought for grilling compared to a regular week. The average Israeli consumes 19.6 kg of beef per year, about 50% more than in 2015, according to the latest data by the Agriculture Ministry.\nLengy attributed continued price increases to a combination of local and global factors.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The Hamas war led to a decline in demand by war-hit consumers for [more expensive] steaks, but created a ‘contagion effect’ that pushed up the prices of cheaper cuts, such as ground beef, which soared by tens of percent,” said Lengy. “Importers who had accumulated surplus entrecote compensated for the losses by raising the prices of other cuts.”\nIn addition, high concentration in the local meat market, controlled by a small number of importers and slaughterhouses, limits competition, according to Lengy.\n“Due to a shortage of skilled butchers, retail chains switch to the sale of pre-packaged meat, which in turn leads consumers to buy [fresh meat] at more expensive butcher shops,” said Lengy.\nGlobally, “production and input costs, including animal food, such as soybeans and grain prices, which account for about 65% of the cost of raising chickens, have soared in the past year due to trade disruptions, including the trade war between the US and China and the war in Ukraine,” said Lengy.\nUltra Finance analyst Roy Lengy. (Courtesy)\nIsrael is a country without wide open spaces of grazing land for cattle, and a growing population, which increases the country’s reliance on meat imports. Between 70% and 80% of the meat consumed in Israel is derived from imports, and 20% to 30% from local production. Fresh meat from imported calves makes up about a third of the beef consumed in Israel. Imported frozen meat accounts for more than 40%, imported chilled meat 17%, and meat from Israeli-grown calves about 14%.\nEarlier this year, the government introduced rises in taxes, prices and utility bills. The new year also ushered in a slew of reforms aimed at lowering prices by aligning Israeli and European standards to ease trade barriers for imports and foster competition.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe food sector reform includes expanding the adoption of European regulation in areas such as food safety and labeling, to reduce bureaucracy and bring savings to the importer of 7% to 11%.\n“The reform, which came into effect in 2025, helps to cut time and costs of meat imports,” said Lengy. “However, the reform did not lead to a significant price drop [for consumers], partly due to global price increases and the high concentration in the local market.”"}

Flight slots are permissions granted by the airport authority for an airline to land and take off on a particular day and within a specific time frame. It also grants the airline access to airport services and infrastructure.\n“Airport slots — time windows allocated for takeoffs and landings — are highly valuable, especially during peak morning hours,” Ophir Tours deputy chairman Yoni Waxman told The Times of Israel. “Once a slot is given up and taken by another airline, it’s very difficult to reclaim it later, making it harder for the original carrier to offer attractive schedules or seamless connections.”\nOphir Tours deputy chairman Yoni Waxman. (Courtesy)\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has backed Hamas in the war, in which Israel has sought to topple Hamas as Gaza’s de facto government, to secure the release of the hostages taken on October 7, and to prevent the Gaza Strip from posing a security threat to Israel. In May last year, the Islamic country, which has been one of the harshest critics of Israel during Gaza war, cut off all trade with Israel — a dramatic move for Israel’s fifth-largest source of imported goods.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The decision by the Turkish airlines to relinquish their slots at Ben Gurion Airport could signal a major shift in Israel-Turkey relations — or at least a downturn in aviation coordination between the two countries,” said Waxman. “This move raises questions about the Turkish airlines’ underlying motives, whether political or economic.”\nTurkish Airlines and Pegasus Airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nSince the war broke out with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, most foreign airlines have repeatedly canceled and resumed their flights to and from Israel. Hopes for a sustained ceasefire-hostage release deal and a seemingly gradual reduction in tensions earlier this year prompted many major foreign airlines, including UK carrier British Airways, Irish budget carrier Ryanair, and US carriers Delta and United Airlines, to resume part of their flight services to and from Israel in recent weeks, albeit with limited capacity and frequency.\nVirgin Atlantic founder Richard Branson touches down at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel with CEO Shai Weiss in 2019.

Since then, it has grown into the country’s largest private sector employer in the local high-tech sector. Back in 2017, Intel bought Israel’s Mobileye for over $15 billion, which at the time marked the largest exit for an Israeli tech company.\nBefore the recent wave of layoffs and other measures, the chipmaker employed almost 12,000 employees at its three R&D centers — in Haifa, Petah Tikva and Jerusalem — as well as at its manufacturing plant in Kiryat Gat.

In October last year, Intel shut down the operations of Israeli cloud computing tech startup Granulate, which it bought back in 2022 for $650 million.\nIn June, the US chipmaker halted the expansion of a major factory project in Israel, which was planned to pour an extra $15 billion toward the expansion of its chip manufacturing plant in Kiryat Gat, in the south of the country.\n“For more than a decade, all the multinational companies and conglomerates that operate multiple R&D centers in Israel showed substantial resilience and commitment and brought stability as they continued to hire a diversity of people, including engineers and other professionals,” said Adv.

Nvidia is among the international tech giants that have expanded their presence in Israel since launching its first operations in the country in 2016 and opening an AI research center two years later. Its activities in Israel are already the firm’s largest outside of the US, where the chipmaker employs about 4,000 workers in seven R&D centers, including Yokne’am, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Ra’anana and Beersheba.\nMeanwhile, Intel’s woes pushed the chipmaker down four spots to 18th place in the same ranking.\nAdv.

According to the Times, “some officials have struggled with the ethical implications of the AI tools” because they can lead to increased surveillance, civilian deaths and wrongful arrests.\nResponding to the Times, the IDF said specific technologies were confidential and could not be commented on. The newspaper quoted the military as saying Israel “is committed to the lawful and responsible use of data technology tools.”\nFour Israeli officials cited by the Times said the IDF quickly cleared AI tools for deployment after the Gaza war was sparked on October 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed southern Israel to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nSome uses of AI in Gaza have been previously reported, including a virtual reality system that helps soldiers scan urban war zones. Israeli-Palestinian activist outlet +972, which first reported on the Arabic-language chatbot, has also reported on a program called Lavender, said to have helped the IDF amass a list of 37,000 human targets based on their ties to Hamas. The military has denied using AI to generate such a kill list.\nMany of the AI tools were developed in an innovation hub set up by the Military Intelligence Directorate’s Unit 8200, according to the Times. Known as “The Studio,” the hub helped connect enlisted soldiers with reservists who work at companies such as Meta, Google and Microsoft, the Times said, citing the four Israeli officials.\nThen-defense minister Yoav Gallant meets with soldiers of Unit 8200 at one of the unit’s bases, May 19, 2024.

A strike on the area was greenlit despite warnings within the military that several apartment buildings would need to be targeted to ensure Biari was killed. The strike, said to have killed dozens of people, is being probed by the military, which told the Times it was “unable to provide any further information until the investigation is complete.”\nThe audio tool used to locate Biari has been sharpened over time to more accurately locate people, and has served the IDF in finding hostages in Gaza, the Times said, citing Israeli officers.\nFollowing the Hamas onslaught, Israel also erected temporary checkpoints between the Strip’s north and south, with security cameras capable of sending high-resolution images to an AI facial recognition program, the Times said.\nDisplaced Palestinians walk through a muddy road amid the destruction in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip on February 6, 2025.

The IDF, on the other hand, “has decades of intercepted text messages, transcribed phone calls and posts scraped from social media in spoken Arabic dialects,” the Times said, citing the three officers.\nThe program was said to have been developed in the early months of the war and incorporated into multimedia databases, enabling military analysts to run complicated searches of images and videos, the Times said.\nIllustrative: Soldiers of an IDF Military Intelligence Directorate team for the Golani Infantry Brigade are seen working at computers, in a handout photo published November 12, 2023.

Users create and personalize their own avatars through an intuitive online studio that supports over 30 languages that can be deployed across industries from education, finance, to e-commerce. Bekker previously co-founded Voca.ai, acquired by Snap Inc. in 2020 for $70 million.\n“eSelf is making history as the first AI tutoring initiative to be deployed at a national scale,” said CEO Bekker. “It’s an effort that shows how AI can be used for good – leveling the playing field and supporting students at a time when the education system worldwide is under immense strain.”"}

But despite the extra competition to flagship carrier El Al, it will likely be some time before consumers can reasonably hope for airfare prices to begin to sink back toward prewar levels.\nThough El Al is no longer the only option for those looking to fly nonstop between Israel and North America, prices have remained higher than normal. Recent months have seen a second Israeli carrier — Arkia — enter the field, along with two US carriers. But capacity and demand are still limited by war and many Israeli travelers are willing to pay a premium to avoid booking with airlines liable to cancel trips should rocket sirens start blaring again. This keeps El Al from needing to bring down prices to more competitive levels.\nOn Monday, Israir announced that it would become the third Israeli carrier to offer flights to New York, saying it had been granted a two-year temporary carrier permit by the US Department of Transportation, with final approval to launch the route expected by June. The airline said that it hopes to start plying the route by Passover 2026, with as many as six weekly nonstop roundtrip flights between Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport and New York.\n“In the short-term, Israir’s announcement will have zero effect on ticket prices, but in the long-term the carrier could prove to be a competitor for El Al on the route next year,” Ziontours Jerusalem CEO Mark Feldman told The Times of Israel. “However, prices will not drop dramatically until we see an influx of incoming tourists filling up airplanes of foreign and local airlines, but for now, we are in the middle of a war, and they are not returning.”\nOphir Tours chief marketing officer Neta Gafni was hopeful that Israir’s launch of flights to the US would further increase seat availability on the Tel Aviv-New York route, “which in turn means that other carriers operating the service will eventually need to bring down prices to compete and fill up the seats of their planes.”\nSign up for the Tech Israel Daily\nand never miss Israel's top tech stories\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nFor now, round-trip fares on the Tel Aviv-New York route are expected to continue to be priced around $1,200 to $1,800 for the coming months and may climb to around $2,000 or higher during the peak summer travel season.\nPassengers arrive at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv on April 9, 2025. (Avshalom Sassoni/Flash90)\nThat’s a steep discount from last year, when the mass departure of all foreign carriers amid the war in Gaza gave El Al a monopoly on the route and prices climbed as high as $7,000, with economy seats hard to come by.\nBut it’s still significantly higher than the sub-$1000 round-trip tickets that could be had before war broke out 18 months ago.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMark Feldman, CEO of Ziontours. (Courtesy)\nThe entry of additional Israeli airlines and partial return of US airlines will probably not be enough to bring airfares on direct flights to New York back down to those levels, according to travel experts who spoke to The Times of Israel.\nThe plans for the debut of Israir’s long-haul flight service to New York come after Israel’s Arkia launched nonstop service between Tel Aviv and New York in early February, betting that Israelis would be eager to fly abroad during the peak spring and summer travel seasons. The Israeli carrier originally planned to operate the route for a period of only three months, but recently extended the service until October.\nHopes for a sustained ceasefire-hostage release deal and a seemingly gradual reduction in tensions earlier this year also prompted some major foreign airlines, including US carriers Delta and United Airlines, to resume part of their flight services to and from Israel in recent weeks, albeit with limited capacity and frequency. United Airlines restarted its flights to Israel on March 15, and Delta Air Lines relaunched its Tel Aviv-New York route on April 1.\nFeldman noted that round-trip ticket prices to New York in May for flights operated by US carriers are selling for around $1,500, while El Al’s price tag is $1,800. Round-trip airfares from Tel Aviv to New York with Arkia sell for as low as around $999, including luggage, seating and two meals, but only for a limited special promotion period during May and June. From July, Arkia’s round-trip fare on the route is around $1,800, similar to El Al’s ticket prices.\nBut going for the cheaper fares on foreign airlines — or finding a bargain by stopping in Europe — comes with the added worry that flights could be canceled due to the security situation and passengers could be stranded.\nAn Arkia flight over Tel Aviv, December 14, 2024. (Yossi Aloni FLASH90)\n“That’s a nice, substantial difference for people who are flying with United to Newark, taking the risk, hoping that United will not pull out again, and saving a few hundred dollars against El Al,” said Feldman. “Consumers may still get mad about why El Al ticket prices are still high, but at least we can now offer them alternatives with United or Delta, which we could not a year ago.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nArkia, meanwhile, lacks the ability to fully compete with El Al on a level playing field, he added.\n“Arkia attracts a different clientele, they have found a niche with marketing to the ultra-Orthodox population, but they are not the businesspeople who will prefer to fly with airlines such as El Al as it is reliable and offers connections within North America,” said Feldman.\nOphir Tours chief marketing officer Neta Gafni. (Courtesy/Dan Peretz)\nFeldman said that consumers who bought their tickets in January and February paid a more expensive airfare than people buying their tickets in April for the summer. Gafni called current prices “reasonable.”\n“Israelis can buy summer ticket prices for what they were paying in February and March — they were paying around $2,500 in February to fly, and now they can fly under that in the summer,” said Feldman.\nBoth said that most of their customers still prefer to book with El Al because of the built-up trust among travelers that the flagship carrier is a safe bet as it continued to fly during the war when foreign carriers stopped flying.\n“We are seeing that competition hasn’t much affected El Al since their planes are full as there are still enough people willing to pay a premium to fly with El Al,” said Feldman. “People have been flying El Al for every reason in the last 18 months: it is a reliable, safe, and stable airline, and they know they are going to fly and get home when foreign carriers stop their services if the security situation deteriorates.”\n“That’s why we haven’t seen El AL lower its prices to compete with Arkia, and that’s why United or Delta can come back and grab market space, which is what they have done with slightly cheaper prices,” Feldman added. “This will certainly continue for the spring and for the summer, unless the situation in Gaza is resolved and the security situation changes.”"}

Citron served a total of 200 days in Gaza as a combat paramedic in the IDF’s 401st Armored Brigade.\nAt the peak of his first round of reserve duty in December 2023, Citron briefly exited at the Zikim crossing to escort a military troop convoy on its way into the Strip. While waiting at the crossing for some 40 minutes, Citron was asked by his unit to speak to an “American” man who had flown in from New York to deliver supplies to soldiers. The unit was hoping to raise funds towards purchasing better equipment, a common practice in the early chaotic days of the war when the IDF’s supply chain was not at peak efficiency.\nThat “American” was Brazilian-born Alan Buch — Citron’s distant friend of almost a decade. The brief exit from Gaza was, for Citron, a seasoned venture capitalist, a “wild and unexpected chance” encounter. The meeting ultimately led to a new $35 million fund for investments into very young startups established under extraordinary circumstances while its founder was on reserve duty in Gaza.\n“Since the outbreak of war, it has been a back and forth between being a soldier, a venture capitalist, a father, and a husband,” the 34-year-old Citron told The Times of Israel.\nSign up for the Tech Israel Daily\nand never miss Israel's top tech stories\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“When you’re deep in combat in Gaza, you completely forget what normal life looks like — everything revolves around the mission,” said the Israeli-born Citron, who lives in the central city of Ra’anana with his wife and three children. “That random surprise encounter with Alan at a time when you are removed from your ‘normal life’ was a pretty crazy and unforgettable story.”\nReserve combat paramedic David Citron (far left) during a military operation inside the Gaza Strip.

Buch, who studied in Sao Paolo and Austria before building a career in global wealth and alternative investment management, had been living in Brooklyn in recent years.\n“After October 7, I couldn’t just sit in Brooklyn doing nothing,” said Buch, who also lived in Israel for two years in his early teens. “I got on a plane to Israel and traveled across the country to find ways I could help.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“I raised donations, delivered gear to soldiers, and one day, at the Zikim crossing, I suddenly saw David,” he said.\nDuring the chance reunion, Buch told his friend that he wanted to increase his involvement in Israel. Then Citron reentered Gaza.\n“We started hanging out together more when Alan was traveling back and forth from New York to Israel, and I was in between reserve duty rounds,” said Citron. “We began talking about how we could join forces as Alan wanted to do more in Israel, not just from a philanthropic perspective but also from a business perspective.”\n“We wanted to combine both fashions, investing in tech companies and investing in Israel,” Citron added.\nCitron built up his investment career at Israeli VC fund OurCrowd and Flint Capital, a Boston-based VC firm that has invested in Israeli technology for more than a decade. He also launched Sheva, a VC fund he co-founded with former Israeli NBA player Omri Casspi, which he still manages. His notable investments include Eon, Upwind, PointFive, Flow Security (acquired by Crowdstrike), CyberX (acquired by Microsoft), and Cyolo.\n“Since we’re both investors, we decided to channel our energy into a new fund focused on supporting Israeli innovation,” said Buch.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe two started to develop the idea of raising a tech fund in July last year, but Citron shared that the biggest challenge for advancing their new venture were the long stretches of reserve duty in Gaza.\nAlan Buch (left) and David Citron, co-founders of venture capital fund, TBD VC, in New York.

The fund also plans to participate in seed fundraising rounds of startups founded by Israeli entrepreneurs.\nTBD hopes to funnel about $1 million apiece into 20 young startups focused on cybersecurity, enterprise software, and infrastructure. The fund is backed by a mix of institutional investors from Israel and the United States, family offices, and Israeli cyber entrepreneurs.\n“We are looking for startups where the mindset of the entrepreneurs is scrappy but efficient, able to communicate even in the most intense situation,” said Citron. “It ties back to my mindset and how it’s evolved since the war, what it means to be in a war zone, and the people you have got in the battlefield.”\nCitron said one of the fund’s targets is to “focus on making the tech world more accessible to combat veterans.”\n“As a paramedic during the war, I chatted with thousands of soldiers, many of the best warriors I have ever met, and sadly, most weren’t connected to tech,” said Citron. “When you ask them about what they will do after being discharged, they find it challenging to get their footing from a career perspective.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraeli reserve soldiers take part in a military drill in the Golan Heights, northern Israel, January 24, 2024. (Ayal Margolin/Flash90)\n“We’re now working on creative ways to help,” said Citron.\nThe venture capitalist said that one of the initiatives is to donate a portion of the fund’s profits to Gav Lalohem, a nonprofit organization that helps released soldiers build skills for careers in tech and other professional sectors.\n“If you’re a fellow [reserve soldier] who is trying to find your footing, please reach out to me,” Citron wrote on his LinkedIn profile. “The least I will do is buy you a cup of coffee and leverage my network.”"}

Destruction of the bone marrow and blood cells ensues, leading to severe anemia, infection and bleeding.\nDeath can occur in four to eight weeks if effective treatment is not received.\nSign up for the Tech Israel Daily\nand never miss Israel's top tech stories\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nOver the past two decades, Pluri has focused on developing 3D technology to mimic how living cells communicate and interact with the body to grow and expand. The biotech firm harnesses stem cells extracted from placenta donated by healthy women who have given birth by cesarean section in hospitals around the country. The single placenta cells are cultivated in a proprietary 3D bioreactor system with a micro-environment that resembles and simulates the human body.\n“Cells are the building blocks of life — everything in our world starts and ends with cells,” Pluri chief commercial officer Nimrod Bar Zvi told The Times of Israel. “These tiny cells are amazing creatures that exist in almost any aspect of our life, whether we get them from humans, animals, or plants.”\nBar Zvi explained that once placed inside bioreactors, the stem cells latch onto scaffolds and start “to communicate with each other and proliferate, similar to what happens in the human body, and they are secreting proteins as we mimic the conditions of the natural environment they need to expand.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nUsing the 3D cell expansion technology method, a single placenta cell can be multiplied into billions of distinct cells, Pluri said. As a result, cells from a single placenta can treat more than 20,000 patients.\n“In the end of that process, we have a vial that contains a specific amount of our placental expanded cells depending on the dosage needed for the patient,” said Bar Zvi. “Once the vial with the cells is injected into the muscle, it stimulates the human body’s own capabilities for the reactivation and regeneration of blood cells, mitigates the effects of radiation exposure and we see the recovery happening.”\nPluri chief commercial officer Nimrod Bar Zvi. (Courtesy)\nPluri says that its cell-based treatment stimulates and regenerates the production of all three types of blood cells produced in the blood marrow: white and red blood cells as well as platelets.\nUnder the terms of the collaboration agreement with Hemafund and subject to receiving external government and private sector funding, the veteran biotech firm will produce and supply an initial capacity of 12,000 doses of its PLX-R18, sufficient to treat 6,000 people. The doses will be stored and managed by Hemafund and delivered to medical institutions across Ukraine in case of need.\n“At present, there are no other treatments for radiation poisoning that use stem cells taken from a placenta as far as we know,” said Bar Zvi. “The ability to treat acute radiation exposure with cell therapy and to scale it up for mass production is where we are unique since we can supply thousands and thousands of vials to large numbers of people.”\nPluri is publicly traded on the Nasdaq as well as the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. At the Matam Advanced Technology Park in Haifa, the biotech firm operates a cell therapy production facility, which it says has been designed to handle large-scale manufacturing of cellular therapies. It could also be mobilized for mass production to respond to global emergencies if nuclear threats escalate. The firm employs a total of 130 people.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPluri and Hemafund said they will also seek to advance clinical trials to register the PLX-R18 therapy as a radiation countermeasure and obtain necessary regulatory approvals from Ukraine’s health ministry. The collaboration is expected to potentially generate over $100 million in value for both parties.\n“Our cryostorage facilities and logistics network position us well to support the introduction of PLX-R18 as a potential vital tool for radiation emergency preparedness in Ukraine,” said Hemafund founder Yaroslav Issakov. “While we hope such treatments remain precautionary, our goal is to stand ready to distribute this potential therapy in the event of an emergency.”\nPluri uses patented technology to create cell-based pharmaceutical and food products. (Courtesy)\nPluri said that its PLX-R18 has been safely tested in both humans and animals. Results from a series of recent studies in animals of its stem cell therapy after radiation exposure demonstrated an increase in survival rates from 29% in the placebo group to 97% in the treated group.\nThe administration of PLX- R18 as a prophylactic measure 24 hours before radiation exposure, and again 72 hours after exposure, resulted in an increase in survival rates, from 4% in the placebo group to 74% in the treated group.\nThe FDA previously cleared an Investigational New Drug application for PLX-R18 for the treatment of radiation sickness and granted it Orphan Drug Designation. This means that should a nuclear event take place, Pluri could use the drug to treat victims.\nPluri’s bioreactors for the cultivation of cell-based therapy products. (Courtesy/Michael Brikman)\nIn July 2023, Pluri was awarded a three-year $4.2 million contract by the US National Institutes of Health to continue to develop its novel treatment for deadly radiation sickness and to collaborate with the US Department of Defense’s Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute in Maryland.\nAs part of the contract, the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) will fund final studies required to complete the biotech firm’s application for FDA approval to market its PLX-R18 therapy.\nPluri hopes that the approval would make it eligible for purchase by the US Strategic National Stockpile — the country’s repository of critical medical supplies — as a medical countermeasure for exposure to nuclear radiation."}

Understanding the regulation and its implications for relevant technology companies has proven to be a major challenge. Notably, it was surprising to see Israel categorized in “Tier 2,” rather than among the closest US allies.\nAt this point, there is no information on what will replace Biden’s regulation—or when. Presumably, pressure from US companies played a role. However, it is more plausible that the timing of the announcement is related to President Trump’s planned trip to the Middle East, specifically to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. These countries, also placed in Tier 2, were undoubtedly concerned about the limitations imposed on them by the AI Diffusion Rule, particularly restrictions on the export of chips and AI models from the US.\nAnother valid reason for postponing the rule’s implementation is the practical need for preparation and staffing for enforcement. The US Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), under the Department of Commerce, is responsible for these tasks, including licensing and compliance (see a discussion on this here.)\nThis brings us to the recently submitted budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 by the Office of Management and Budget—President Trump’s first proposed budget of his second term. While the budget introduces significant cuts to many agencies and programs, it increases BIS funding by more than 50% “to protect the Nation’s technological competitiveness and counter threats from China” (see here, page 24).\nThe proposed budget deals a blow to critical institutions such as the National Science Foundation. Its language is strikingly critical, especially regarding funding for climate initiatives, clean energy, and more. However, it clarifies: “Funding for Artificial Intelligence and quantum information sciences research is maintained at current levels.” (ibid., page 38). Similarly, while it reduces climate-related funding at the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, it affirms: “The Budget maintains US competitiveness in priority areas such as high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, quantum information science, fusion, and critical minerals.” (ibid., page 21).\nThe key question now is whether maintaining current funding levels for AI basic research is sufficient for the US to retain its global leadership. In the long run, an environment of deep cuts in science and technology poses risks to talent development, knowledge creation, and sustained innovation.\nMeanwhile, in Israel, there will be a loud sigh of relief if the Trump administration does indeed scrap the AI Diffusion Rule. There is hope for an improved position under the replacement regulation. However, such improvement is less likely unless Israel stops delaying the development and publication of a national AI strategy—one that includes proper safeguards and is coordinated with the US Government."}

With this week’s launch of the Adelson Institute for Smart Materials at Bar-Ilan University, Israel is staking its claim as a world leader in one of the most promising and impactful scientific frontiers of our time.\nThe Adelson Family Foundation’s transformative gift to Bar-Ilan, announced on May 7th, is far more than a philanthropic milestone. It’s an investment in humanity’s shared future — a future in which smart materials will drive the next generation of innovation across medicine, energy, sustainability, and technology.\nSmart materials are substances that adapt and respond dynamically to their environments. They can sense, analyze, and react to stimuli like temperature, pressure, and light. Imagine a world where cancer is treated not with broad-spectrum chemotherapy, but with nano-robots that target diseased cells while sparing the healthy ones. Imagine medical sensors that constantly monitor your body for early signs of illness — and deliver treatment before you even feel sick. This isn’t science fiction. It’s the realm of smart materials, and it’s happening now. At Bar-Ilan, we’re making sure it happens faster, smarter, and for the benefit of all.\nWhat makes the Adelson Institute unique is not only its scientific mission, but its vision. For the first time in Israel — and with few parallels around the world — a single research institute will unite experts across chemistry, engineering, AI, medicine, and life sciences to co-develop smart materials and transition them rapidly from lab to market. This is interdisciplinary collaboration at its boldest and best.\nEqually important is Bar-Ilan’s dual identity as both a research powerhouse and a hub of practical innovation. The university excels not only in theoretical discovery but in application — taking ideas and turning them into scalable, real-world solutions. That’s precisely why the Adelson Institute belongs here, on our campus, embedded in the dynamic fabric of Israeli ingenuity.\nThis institute will maintain and expand Israel’s status as a force for scientific advancement — particularly in energy and health care, where innovation has the power to transform lives on a global scale. It’s a vision that aligns perfectly with Bar-Ilan’s values: academic excellence, social impact, and a steadfast commitment to strengthening Israel’s future through scientific leadership.\nUnder the leadership of Prof. Arie Zaban, Bar-Ilan’s president and a pioneering chemist in his own right, the institute is poised to build stronger ties between academia and industry and to bridge the gap between research and real-world solutions.\nThis moment is also a celebration of partnership. The Adelson Family Foundation’s generosity empowers not only Bar-Ilan’s researchers and students but also our broader global network — including our American friends and supporters who are deeply invested in Israel’s continued role as a leader in science and innovation.\nThe Adelson Family Foundation’s gift also means that the relationship between Bar-Ilan and Dr. Miriam Adelson, co-founder of the foundation along with her late husband Sheldon Adelson (z”l), has come full circle. In 2019, Bar-Ilan recognized Dr. Adelson with an honorary doctorate for her contributions to medicine.\nDr. Adelson developed a methadone program for teen addicts. When Bar-Ilan awarded her the honorary doctorate, she said she chose medicine as her career “in order to liberate people from the bondage of sickness and injury. In treating the disease of drug addiction over the last three decades, I have seen how this liberation radiates out upon society as a whole: it spares addicts’ relatives untold distress. And it spares the law enforcement, courts, welfare, and health systems needless expense and exertion.”\nIn the ensuing years, Dr. Adelson and Bar-Ilan deepened their relationship. Now, with the foundation’s gift to our institution, Dr. Adelson has in my opinion once again affirmed that science can serve both Israel and all of humanity.\nThe future of medicine, technology, and sustainable living are all being written in the labs and minds of today’s researchers. Thanks to the nascent Adelson Institute at Bar-Ilan, that future is closer than ever.\nLet’s build it together."}

The Nazis’ explicit intention was to annihilate every Jew, everywhere, without exception, aiming for the global eradication of the Jewish people. This total, borderless extermination was carried out using modern industrial and bureaucratic means, including death camps, gas chambers, and meticulous record-keeping. The Holocaust was a state-sponsored, all-encompassing project, with the Nazis’ pseudo-scientific racial ideology framing Jews as an existential threat to the “Aryan race” and civilization itself. Beyond physical destruction, the Holocaust sought to erase millennia of Jewish teaching, history, and identity.\nPTSD experienced by WWII Holocaust survivors is distinct from PTSD in modern conflicts or events like the October 7 attacks. Studies report rates of 46% to 55% in controlled samples and even higher (up to 91.8% in those with comorbid psychiatric illness). Holocaust survivors are at increased risk for comorbid psychiatric conditions, including depression, late-life paranoia, and psychotic disorders, which can complicate PTSD symptoms and treatment. Many Holocaust survivors experience profound guilt, shame, and survivor’s guilt, struggling with existential questions about why they survived while others did not.\nThe Holocaust’s trauma has profoundly impacted subsequent generations through psychological and biological mechanisms. Digital technologies have revolutionized how this trauma is remembered, shared, and processed, making historical trauma more accessible and relatable to younger generations. Online communities provide support, foster collective identity, and enable identity transformation by connecting descendants with shared histories and cultural legacies. However, digital technologies also raise ethical concerns about privacy, misrepresentation, and the potential for re-traumatization through exposure to graphic content or online hate.\nThis paper explores the multifaceted impact of digital technologies on the transmission of Holocaust trauma, examining both the opportunities and challenges they present.\nFrom Silence to Sharing: Breaking the Taboo of Trauma.\nHolocaust trauma was often characterized by silence within families and communities, leading to isolation and repression among descendants. Digital platforms, particularly social media, have played a crucial role in breaking this silence by enabling survivors and their descendants to share personal narratives and foster open dialogue about traumatic histories. Facebook groups like “The Holocaust and My Family” and “The Descendants of the Victims and Survivors of the Holocaust” have become central to trauma processing, providing a space for individuals to connect with others who share similar histories.\nFacebook groups help break taboos of silence by enabling open sharing of personal and family Holocaust stories, unblocking previously inaccessible avenues to the past and supporting individual and collective trauma processing. They provide a supportive environment where members can connect, feel understood, and gain recognition for their experiences. The act of sharing and responding to posts helps reconstruct trauma narratives and reintegrate individuals into a community, which are important steps in trauma recovery.\nThe collective sharing and discussion in these digital spaces contribute to the modernization and transformation of Jewish identity and collective memory, making them more dynamic and inclusive. Online groups offer accessibility and anonymity, allowing participants to withdraw at any time. However, emotional intensity, conflict, risk of trivialization or misunderstanding, ethical and privacy concerns, and uneven support may arise. While Facebook groups are powerful tools for breaking silence, building community, and processing trauma, they also come with challenges related to emotional safety, privacy, and the complexities of online interaction.\nConnective & Collaborative Memory.\nDigital media facilitate what scholars call “connective memory,” where individual and collective memories are interwoven through interactive platforms and algorithms. This concept is significant because it allows for a more dynamic and participatory form of memory transmission, where individuals can contribute to and engage with a shared historical narrative. Projects that reimagine Holocaust stories for the digital age exemplify this connective memory.\nThe Eva Stories Instagram project, created and produced by Israeli tech entrepreneur Mati Kochavi and his daughter Maya Kochavi, adapts the real diary of Eva Heyman into a series of 70 Instagram stories, launching the project on May 1, 2019, to coincide with Holocaust Remembrance Day. The project was filmed in Ukraine by ColorFilm and the Israeli company POV Shahar Segal Productions. The Eva Stories Instagram project, presents a historical narrative as if experienced in today’s digital environment, making the past more relatable and accessible to younger generations. This project adapts the real diary of 13-year-old Holocaust victim Eva Heyman into a series of Instagram “Stories,” presenting her life as if she had a smartphone and was documenting events in real time. Using short videos, photos, and text, the project immerses followers in Eva’s daily experiences-from family life to the Nazi invasion and her deportation to Auschwitz-mirroring the way young people share their lives today. Launched for Holocaust Memorial Day, Eva Stories quickly went viral, amassing hundreds of thousands of followers and millions of views worldwide, especially among younger audiences. This innovative approach makes the Holocaust more immediate and emotionally resonant for new generations, transforming Eva from a distant historical figure into a relatable, lifelike presence and sparking widespread conversation about Holocaust remembrance in the digital age.\nPlatforms like Yad Vashem’s Central Database and the USC Shoah Foundation’s Visual History Archive use advanced technologies—such as optical character recognition, machine translation, and recommendation systems—to make personal histories more accessible and discoverable. These platforms support individual family research and collective remembrance, ensuring that Holocaust survivors’ stories are preserved and shared with future generations. AI tools, such as image recognition and natural language processing, can quickly sift through millions of pages, photographs, and testimonies, extracting names, dates, places, and relationships that would be nearly impossible to find manually. This innovation not only accelerates the recovery of lost names and stories but also helps families reconnect with their histories and preserves the memories of Holocaust survivors for future generations.\nVR technologies, particularly adaptive graded exposure methods, have shown promising results in treating PTSD. Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) creates controlled, immersive environments for patients to confront trauma safely, with success rates ranging from 66% to 90%. A meta-analysis found that VR-based graded exposure therapy (VR-GET) significantly reduces PTSD symptoms, outperforming conventional VRET. VR-GET’s advantage lies in its immersive, tailored approach, allowing gradual exposure and real-time monitoring, enhancing emotional engagement and symptom reduction. Other studies confirm VR therapy’s benefits in reducing PTSD symptoms, anxiety, depression, and improving quality of life, especially in first responders and veterans. VR therapy’s ability to recreate multi-sensory, symbolic trauma-related environments suggests potential for personalized treatment of complex trauma, such as Holocaust-related PTSD.\nEmotional Resonance & Postmemory.\nDigital storytelling, incorporating multimedia elements like photos, videos, and personal narratives, significantly heightens the emotional resonance of Holocaust remembrance for younger generations. The concept of “postmemory” describes how descendants of survivors form profound emotional connections to traumatic events they did not directly experience. Digital tools amplify this process by enabling immersive and affective engagement with historical materials. Digital storytelling allows descendants to experience a more visceral connection to their family histories, fostering a deeper understanding of the trauma their ancestors endured. This emotional resonance is crucial for the transmission of Holocaust memory, as it ensures that the stories of survivors continue to evoke empathy and understanding in future generations. Interactive technologies, such as AI-based virtual witnesses, further enhance this process by allowing users to engage directly with survivor testimonies, creating powerful emotional encounters and new forms of virtual witnessing. Digital media not only preserves Holocaust memory but also deepens its emotional impact across generations.\nCommunity, Identity, and Transformation.\nOnline communities offer a platform for Holocaust survivors’ descendants to process trauma, support each other, and negotiate their identities. This process of identity negotiation is crucial for integrating traumatic histories into personal and collective narratives, allowing individuals to find meaning and purpose in their experiences. Groups like Continuing Generations and Second Generation Los Angeles provide opportunities for descendants to share stories, participate in educational and social programs, and build lasting relationships. These forums provide emotional support, address intergenerational trauma, and foster a sense of belonging. Public sharing and dialogue in these spaces aid individual healing and contribute to the ongoing transformation and modernization of Jewish identity. By connecting descendants through dialogue, storytelling, and cultural activities, these communities ensure that Holocaust memory remains a living, evolving part of Jewish identity and collective consciousness.\nNew Ethical and Psychological Challenges.\nDigital technologies have revolutionized access to Holocaust memory, but they also present ethical and psychological challenges. These include handling sensitive data, retraumatization, and the risk of trivializing or distortion of traumatic histories. Platform design and moderation must be careful to ensure privacy and security, as personal stories of survivors and their descendants are shared on public platforms. The potential for retraumatization must also be considered, as individuals may be exposed to distressing content that triggers emotional responses. Platform designers and moderators must balance open dialogue with the protection of individuals’ well-being. Additionally, retraumatization can occur when testimonies are edited or shared widely, potentially triggering traumatic memories. Gamification and certain digital formats can trivialize traumatic histories, undermining their educational value. These challenges underscore the need for ongoing vigilance and updated ethical guidelines to preserve Holocaust memory with integrity and respect. Balancing open access to archives with protecting contributors from misuse, hate, or denialism remains a persistent dilemma.\nConclusively, Digital technologies have transformed the transmission of Holocaust trauma from silence to sharing, collaboration, and emotional resonance. These platforms preserve memories and empower new generations to process and integrate traumatic histories into their identities. However, they also present ethical and psychological challenges that require ongoing attention. As we navigate the digital age, it’s crucial to consider the implications of these technologies for Holocaust memory and trauma transmission. Fostering community engagement, dialogue, and data protection procedures can help preserve and access stories of Holocaust survivors with mindfulness and honor for future generations.\nCitations:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/eva.stories\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/instagram-account-memorializing-holocaust-victim-reaches-over-120-million-views\nhttps://archive.kyivpost.com/lifestyle/ukrainians-help-create-viral-eva-stories-that-bring-holocaust-victim-diary-to-instagram.html\nhttps://www.oneclub.org/articles/all/-view/eva-stories\nhttps://www.gathersocial.co.uk/success/generating-holocaust-awareness-with-eva-stories-on-instagram\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/world/middleeast/eva-heyman-instagram-holocaust.html\nhttps://www.theedgemedia.org/the-holocaust-on-social-media/\nhttps://www.jta.org/2020/05/27/ny/israeli-instagram-shoah-series-wins-webbys\nhttps://www.theedgemedia.org/the-holocaust-on-social-media/\nhttps://archive.kyivpost.com/lifestyle/ukrainians-help-create-viral-eva-stories-that-bring-holocaust-victim-diary-to-instagram.html\nhttps://aish.com/509366491\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/eva-stories-remembering-the-holocaust-with-instagram/a-48580311\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37545419\nhttps://philarchive.org/rec/BARHRI-2\nhttps://complexdiscovery.com/honoring-holocaust-remembrance-day-in-the-digital-age/\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17506980241312341\nhttps://www.sup.org/books/jewish-studies/holocaust-memory-digital-age/excerpt/introduction\nhttps://cris.biu.ac.il/en/publications/holocaust-remembrance-in-the-digital-age-the-transformative-influ\nhttps://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781503602960/html?lang=en\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352289521000266\nhttps://www.research.va.gov/currents/1016-3.cfm\nhttps://renewedlightmh.com/livingston-ptsd-support-for-holocaust-survivors\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1536271/\nhttps://www.aaets.org/traumatic-stress-library/holocaust-survivors-and-their-children-a-search-for-positive-effects\nhttps://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2010/09/holocaust-survivors\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3181591/\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/26813154\nhttps://www.radicalphilosophy.com/article/understanding-the-holocaust\nhttps://besacenter.org/holocaust-uniqueness/\nhttps://www.yadvashem.org/blog/the-unprecedented-nature-of-the-holocaust.html\nhttps://www.routledge.com/Is-the-Holocaust-Unique-Perspectives-on-Comparative-Genocide/SRosenbaum/p/book/9780813344065\nhttps://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/edit/10.4324/9780429495137/holocaust-unique-alan-rosenbaum\nhttps://www.research.va.gov/currents/1016-3.cfm\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6720013/\nhttps://howdidtheholocaustaffect.uark.edu/2024/06/14/the-holocaust-and-generational-trauma/\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jts.22856\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6720013\nhttps://www.apa.org/topics/trauma/trauma-survivors-generations\nhttps://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.19060618"}

The message, worded in English and asking for help with a new initiative he’s trying to get off the ground, was polite and focused. The email was completely personalized, with no embarrassing linguistic errors or offers to share the inheritance of some Nigerian prince. I wasn’t asked for any personal details, there was no sense of artificial urgency about it, and it came in at a reasonable time of the day. It didn’t contain any content that was too good to be true. No one promised me a big prize or asked for a donation. It wasn’t even a “whaling” scam, in which someone pretends to be a senior manager in your organization and asks you for something. \nI replied politely that I’d be happy to help. A few days later, this individual asked that we switch to WhatsApp, and that didn’t seem odd to me either, because he gave me a UK phone number, and I understood that the individual in question lives there part of the time. I read a PDF he sent me with the plan for the initiative, and while it was fairly general, I could see that it was appropriate for someone with a bird’s-eye view of things. I sent him a voice message along those lines, and didn’t give it any more thought.\nThat was where things started to go wrong. A few days later, I traveled to a conference in New Delhi. There, I received a series of messages from the former director general, this time in Hebrew. He asked to schedule a conversation, and I wrote that because I would be in Delhi the entire week, I’d be happy to set a time for the beginning of the following week. He said that was fine, but that the meeting would be with his assistant in the United States. And then came the slam dunk giveaway: I was sent a link that I was asked to open from my computer, “for security reasons.” That was the “ah-ha” moment. At that point, I realized I had been taken in. Of course, I didn’t click on the link.\nBut I was unnerved. I was outside Israel, at an international conference, with no other Israelis. I realized that I had told a bad actor where I was, and had thus made myself even more vulnerable. I found myself looking around from time to time to check I wasn’t being followed. When an Indian hotel worker asked me in the elevator, “Is everything alright, ma’am?” I said it was, but when she asked what room I was staying in, I didn’t know whether to answer her. When I needed drinking water from room service, I was afraid to ask for it. Every taxi driver became a potential threat.\nI swallowed my pride and wrote to a good friend in Israel, an outstanding digital investigator. She asked to see screenshots of the correspondence and recommended that I block the number in question. I have to admit that I hadn’t thought to carry out even this simple action.\nI had fallen victim to a type of attack known as spear-phishing. In phishing, attackers send scam emails that contain links to malicious websites. Spear-phishing is focused on a specific target. If the context wasn’t as serious, I might even have been flattered, because whoever did this had to conduct in-depth research on the target, that is, on me.\nMy first question was: Who was after me? Was this a financial scam? Who wanted access to the contents of my computer? A quick Google search for “spear-phishing attack” in Hebrew revealed that in recent months, the Shin Bet had uncovered cyberattacks by Iran against senior figures in the defense establishment as well as politicians, academicians, and journalists. In each case, a suitable cover story had been fabricated and individually tailored. A Shin Bet official had commented that “the goal of this threat is assassination.” It was also reported that the Shin Bet had launched a large-scale operation to update and brief the relevant individuals. I, however, hadn’t been warned, and I soon realized I may never have an answer. \nThe deeply worrying part was that the spear-phisher’s approach was personally tailored to elicit a response from me. Recent research shows that spear-phishing attacks are responsible for 95% of successful hacking operations. This indicates a critical gap in cyber defenses, which focus primarily on technical protections and fail to address psychological vulnerabilities. Attackers use techniques that exploit frailties in the human psyche to bypass even the most secure technological defenses.\nPlaying on my desire to help\nSo, what were the frailties in my psyche, and despite my cyber expertise, that allowed the ruse to get as far as it did? My “root cause analysis” found no misuse of authority, because I didn’t get the email from my boss, nor was there an artificial sense of urgency that made me respond. Perhaps it was cognitive overload – I work at a fast pace with a high volume of correspondence. And here’s an uncomfortable truth: I don’t properly vet the address of every email I get, especially when there are no obvious red flags.\nEventually, I found the sign I should have clocked as being suspicious: The original email address contained a real name, the @ sign, and a real organization name, but then there was another @ followed by “proton.me.” Like gmail.com, this is a suffix belonging to an email service. But there’s a key difference: Gmail doesn’t allow addresses with a double @ sign, so as to prevent fraud like this, but Proton does, which is why it has become a useful and effective tool for attackers.\nBut it wasn’t simply that I had missed that technical red flag. It was, more than anything else, the way the attack played on my desire to help and to be involved. The email included a request for advice and for my professional opinion. When someone asks for a favor, the initial instinct is to want to say yes. This mutuality bias, along with a polite writing style and the allusion to a problem where my expertise could be of help, was precisely aligned with the kind of communication I would expect from someone like the supposed sender.\nLuckily for me, nothing happened in the real world: I didn’t hand over sensitive details, no one drained my bank account, and I wasn’t physically harmed. But I did experience hours of anxiety and stress. I couldn’t help thinking about the public implications: First, I didn’t know where to turn. Is there a support line for individuals in such cases? And if I were to contact it, would I be suspected of communicating with a foreign agent? \nSecond, there’s a need for psychological support to reframe these events and prevent targets from experiencing them with a sense of shame. And third, what should be done regarding the real person who was impersonated? I decided to call him. The conversation was embarrassing, especially when he asked, perhaps rightly, “How can I know that it’s really you, and that what you’re telling me is true?”\nUltimately, I have developed a set of assumptions about the world, about people. Did my belief in people’s basic decency act against me? And how can we lead our lives with immense wariness and suspicion while also maintaining our sense of trust in others? We can talk about education, awareness, and digital literacy to prevent these kinds of attacks, as I have spent decades doing, but the tools being used are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the damage to our sense of personal security is ever more painful.

I planned to teach (and love) Palestinian children in the West Bank. Naive and idealistic, I was an un-Zionist Jew, by which I mean that I had no Zionist education.\nI arrived at Ben Gurion Airport, stepped onto the land of Israel, and burst into tears. Inexplicably, I was home. I didn’t yet understand the connection between diaspora Jews and Israel. I hadn’t yet studied the archaeological evidence, visited the ancestral caves or stuffed a prayer into a crack in the Western Wall. I had never peered inside a Jewish prayer book and knew nothing of the Torah; the hundreds of references to Israel in Jewish lore and liturgy weren’t tucked away in my subconscious mind. I didn’t know that Jews were indigenous to the land of Israel. I just felt it.\nStill stalwart in my resolution to carry out the original, peace-building plan, I took a Palestinian sherut van across the green line to the U.S.-funded, pro-Palestinian NGO where I would volunteer. Now a lone Jew at a café table in Bethlehem, the leadership warned me: If I were abducted I would become political bartering fodder. They would not help, rescue, advocate, or rally for my release. Bewildered and scared, I resigned.\nLater that week I enrolled in an orthodox yeshiva in Jerusalem and had a revelatory insight: I wasn’t just Jewish, I was part of an am. A people. A transnational, multiracial, book-loving, Nobel-prize winning, category-breaking, genocide-defying people. An ancient people.\nOn Tisha B’Av night I decided to commemorate the destruction of the first and second Jewish temples by sleeping out at Jerusalem’s Wailing Wall. Wearing only a long summery skirt and thin long-sleeved shirt, the drafty, desert night was punishing and I hadn’t thought to bring a coat. I laid down on the Kotel’s limestone ground, wrapped my arms around my knees and somehow slept. At dawn, I woke up stiff, warm, and under several thick wool blankets. I was surrounded by the sound of Jewish women muttering prayers. Which of those women had covered me? There was no one to thank.\nIn the years following – as a young, single woman in Israel, the U.S. and South America – new Jewish acquaintances invited me to coffees and classes, study sessions, excursions and workshops. Jewish strangers taught me Hebrew songs and prayers, they helped me muscle through Rashi script and Talmudic texts. They overlooked my ignorance and faux pas, answered my questions, and brought me from Jewish family to Jewish family, treating me like Jewish family. \nI spent Shabbat nights in these families’ guest rooms; I was welcomed, educated and fed, then invited back and fed again. How had I not known that I belonged to this large global family? How had I spent two full decades of life with a tenuous connection to this vibrant, brilliant tribe?\nYears later, weeks after October 7th, 2023, a Jewish stranger named Paul Allen reached out to me on LinkedIn. He asked me to help him reinvigorate a network of Jewish and allied professionals he had founded 25 years prior. We had never met; only one of his tens of thousands of LinkedIn connections was an acquaintance. His invitation would be a time-intensive volunteer gig, but with global antisemitism reaching a fever pitch, our hostages held without global outcry, and my husband’s family regularly in and out of Israeli bomb shelters, I agreed to help. Was I making a naive decision to build the project of a Jewish stranger? Absolutely.  And it was also time for me to return many Jewish favors. \nToday Tribe – our global network of Jews and allies in business – has a large volunteer leadership team. Our founders community helps startups in Israel and the Jewish diaspora go farther, faster, and our large international jobs community grows daily. Thousands of people are active; every morning I wake up to messages from Tribe members around the world engaged in effective, transnational collaboration. The Tribe network has amassed a reach of more than 38,000 and, to date, we have not collected a penny. We are building Tribe to build each other. And we are just getting started."}

The Khan Station (named for the adjacent theater) will allow travel to Tel Aviv in about 38 minutes, and to Ben Gurion Airport in about 23 minutes, the municipality said. Currently, there is only one train station in Jerusalem, the Yitzhak Navon station at the western entrance of the city.\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThere will also be two light rail stations for the Blue Line, a route under construction that will connect the Ramot neighborhood in northern Jerusalem to Gilo in the southern part of the city. Work on that line, which is expected to open around 2030, began earlier this year.\nAn artist’s rendition of the new First Station District plan for Jerusalem (Eden – Jerusalem Economic Development Company)\nA cable car station will also provide transportation to the Old City, taking riders over the Ben Hinnom Valley and Mount Zion, the municipality said. The controversial project was first proposed more than a decade ago, but has been opposed by numerous parties who argued that it is untenably obtrusive and politically irresponsible.\nAuthorities hope the 1.4-kilometer (nearly a mile) cable car will ferry up to 3,000 people per hour in up to 72 10-person cabins. It has been opposed by the Franciscan order that acts as custodian of Catholic sites in the Holy Land, among other religious groups.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe existing First Station entertainment complex and Park Hamesila path will remain open to the public during the ongoing work, and construction will be phased to minimize disruptions, the municipality said. Preliminary work has already begun, including preparing the Khan complex for the light rail. Signs will soon be erected along the Park Hamesila path, guiding visitors through the construction areas.\nThe current First Station complex, opened in 2013, is built on the location of the old Jerusalem railway station, which was constructed in 1892 to connect the city to Jaffa. The new project will be managed by the Jerusalem municipality through Eden, its economic development company.\nRebuilding Jerusalem\nThe announcement of the First Station complex project comes as Jerusalem prepares to approve a NIS 9.72 billion ($2.63 billion) budget for 2025, eight percent higher than the previous year. Combined with a development budget of NIS 6.2 billion approved last December, that would give the city a total budget of some NIS 16 billion for continued investment in education, welfare, culture, transportation, employment and operations, the municipality said.\nThe city also recently recommended for approval a number of significant construction projects in Talpiot and the city’s western entrance.\nAn artist’s rendition of the new project planned at the site of the Achim Yisrael mall in Talpiot (SYL Studio Yigal Levi Architects)\nThe master plan for the industrial area of Talpiot calls for the building of approximately 2 million square meters (21.5 million square feet) of new development, including 10,000 housing units and hundreds of thousands of square meters of office, commercial and public space.\nThe city’s local planning and building committee called this week for the approval of four projects: two 30-story residential towers between HaTaasia, HaHaroshet, and HaOman streets; two 31-story mixed-use residential towers near Pierre Koenig, HaOman, and HaTaasia streets, currently occupied by a gas station and vehicle service facilities; replacing the one-story Beit Bakal site on Yad Harutzim Street with a new 10-story mixed-use building; and demolishing the four-story Ahim Yisrael Mall on Yad Harutzim Street in favor of two 24-story residential towers.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMeanwhile, at the City Gateway project at the entrance to the city, the local planning and building committee recommended the approval of a plan to destroy the old post office building at 217 Jaffa Street to build a complex with two 40-story towers, one of which will house various government ministries and offices.\nAn artist’s rendition of the new tower planned at the entrance to Jerusalem (Zarrhy Architects)\nJerusalem has been aggressively pursuing construction plans that will change the face of the city, with a modernization plan that threatens to add significant congestion for residents. Nearly 500 new skyscrapers of 18 stories or more are planned for construction in Jerusalem in the coming years, adding about 60,000 new housing units to the city, according to municipal documents."}

Most of the Haredim here work, and some have gone to the army. Everyone is happy to live together and get along.”\nBut now, residents of Neve Shamir, otherwise known as Ramat Beit Shemesh Hei, or E — denoting it as the fifth neighborhood of Ramat Beit Shemesh, after A, B, C, and D — are up in arms over plans to turn what was originally going to be a mixed neighborhood into one marketed exclusively to the ultra-Orthodox.\nThe issue came to the fore in March, after Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf bragged to attendees at an education conference in Beit Shemesh that he had used back channels to claim the neighborhood for their sector.\n“What they thought would be for the general public, we found a way to allocate to the Haredi public instead,” Goldknopf was caught on camera saying. “We can’t talk about all the details publicly.”\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nHowever, the change in the status of the neighborhood has been public for almost a year.\nYitzhak Goldknopf (center) in the Knesset on November 11, 2024. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nA new housing project, set to include 3,438 new apartments, is being marketed under the Housing Ministry’s Mehhir LeMatara (target price) program, in which the state arranges with contractors to sell a certain number of housing units at discounted prices.\nThe tender for the project, which also includes office and commercial space, was first announced in December 2023, just two months after Hamas launched its war against Israel on October 7, 2023.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, when the tender was actually offered in May 2024, an extra line of text was added to the project description: “It has elements that are appropriate for an ultra-Orthodox population.”\n“That was unexpected,” Daniel said.\nNew neighborhoods\nLocated in the southeast part of Beit Shemesh, Neve Shamir feels like an active construction site, with rows of apartment buildings in various stages of completion. Just over a thousand families currently live in the neighborhood, out of some 2,000 planned units, said Moshe Shitrit, a member of the Beit Shemesh municipality.\nAs the neighborhood is still in its infancy, community infrastructure is extremely limited. “It’s only apartment buildings. There are almost no stores here yet, and very few official synagogues,” said Daniel, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect his privacy. “We need to drive out to one of the nearby neighborhoods to do our grocery shopping.”\nA street in Neve Shamir lined with housing and construction sites, April 8, 2025 (Zev Stub/Times of Israel)\nDaniel’s garden is on the edge of a cliff, overlooking other neighborhoods down the road. “After we bought our apartment, we noticed that an open area at the bottom of the cliff was being prepared for building, even though that wasn’t in the official municipal plans. We asked about it, and people refused to give us a straight answer. We found out years later that they want to build 12-story buildings here. This is going to add a lot of congestion to a neighborhood where there isn’t enough infrastructure to begin with.”\nAccording to Daniel, the plan calls for 809 apartments to be built in a row parallel to an existing apartment block of similar size that includes only 210 units. That means it will be full of small, densely packed homes designed for low-income Haredi families.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBeit Shemesh municipal councilman Moshe Shitrit (Courtesy)\n“The issue at stake is quality of life,” said Shitrit, whose party in the municipality opposes the plan. “You can see in the planning sketches that they want to make the neighborhood more crowded, and add more synagogues while having less infrastructure for culture and sports. The people who bought homes here expected a different type of community.”\n“I wouldn’t classify this as a dispute between Haredi and secular communities,” Shitrit said. “Many of the people objecting to the plans are Haredi themselves, but they don’t want to live in an exclusively Haredi neighborhood, which is what this is turning into.”\nTurf wars\nWith a population of some 150,000, Beit Shemesh and its different neighborhoods are no strangers to social conflict. Originally populated by new immigrants from Arab countries in the 1950s, the city was “discovered” in the 1990s by English-speaking immigrants who saw the city as a low-cost suburb located near the country’s two largest cities, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.\nHaredi groups also started buying homes in Beit Shemesh in the 1990s, and comprised as much as 40 percent of the population by 2011. As the ultra-Orthodox grew in numbers and power, those from national religious or secular communities, which have lower birthrates, were increasingly edged out of neighborhoods. Incidents of forced segregation and religious coercion became increasingly common as “turf wars” took shape around Haredi groups carving out spaces for their religiously stringent lifestyles.\nToday, 70% of Beit Shemesh is Haredi, Shitrit said, with a sprawling landscape of enclaves for different communities of varying religious bents or backgrounds.  Broadly speaking, the neighborhoods of Ramat Beit Shemesh A and C are popular with educated Haredi English-speaking immigrants, while Ramat Beit Shemesh B is associated with sects of more extreme ideologies.\n“About 10 years ago, as the city continued to expand, Likud made an agreement with the Haredi parties to divide the city,” Shitrit said. “It was decided that Ramat Beit Shemesh D would be Haredi, and Ramat Beit Shemesh E would be for the general population.”\nBecause part of Ramat Beit Shemesh E was ready before Ramat Beit Shemesh D, many Haredi families also chose to purchase homes there, but were generally respectful of the diversity of views in the predominantly national-religious community.\n“There were a handful of extremist families in the community from the beginning, but overall, the community got along really well together,” Daniel said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA street in Neve Shamir lined with homes, April 8, 2025 (Zev Stub/Times of Israel)\nThe trouble started when planning for the second phase of Ramat Beit Shemesh E began, Shitrit said. “All of a sudden, the Haredim started grabbing it for themselves, saying there was never any agreement. That’s what is happening now with the new tender.”\nThe Housing Ministry, meanwhile, tells a different version of the story, claiming that facts have changed on the ground.\n“It’s very simple. The municipality approached the Housing Ministry and said that while it may have planned for a mixed neighborhood a decade ago, today that no longer reflects the reality,” a spokesperson for the ministry said. “Virtually the entire population is Haredi, and there is no point now in bringing a mixed community there. Not only that, but we have commitments to the contractors who are building there to ensure that the project is marketed successfully, and defining this as a Haredi community from the beginning will help ensure that it is a success.”\nReaching an understanding soon will be crucial to manage similar scuffles that will inevitably arise over the coming years.\nBeit Shemesh has been one of Israel’s fastest-growing cities over the past two decades, and an aggressive new master plan for the city looks to more than triple the population to 500,000 in the coming decades. That means that what happens next in this saga will likely set a precedent for future construction plans.\nNationwide trends\nThe expansion of Haredi communities to new areas isn’t exclusive to the Beit Shemesh area. It’s a nationwide phenomenon attributable largely to demographic and economic factors, explained Hebrew University’s Itschak Trachtengot, who specializes in economic policies for Haredi communities.\nDr. Itschak Trachtengot (Hebrew University)\n“Traditionally, Haredim have always preferred to congregate in their own areas, first in Jerusalem and Bnei Brak, and then, starting in the 1980s and 1990s, in satellite cities like Modiin Illit, Elad, Beitar Illit and Beit Shemesh,” Trachtengot said. “But over the years, as their numbers grew and the cost of housing got higher, they started to move into mixed and secular cities and neighborhoods. You can see this in places like Safed, Tiberias, Afula, Kiryat Gat, Kiryat Malachi, Ashdod — many of which are now 25% Haredi or more.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis is a pattern that is likely to continue to replicate itself, Trachtengot said. A number of discounted Mehir LeMatara projects around the country have been prioritized for the Haredi sector, including communities in Karmei Gat West, Rechasim, and Elad, according to the Hebrew news site Mida.\n“It is important to understand that because of the way their community structures are organized, once a certain number of Haredim move into a certain place, many more will come as well,” Trachtengot explained. “Therefore, due to the growth of the community, which now comprises almost 14% of the residents of the State of Israel, it is reasonable to expect that 20 more cities will become Haredi within the next 10 years.”\nWhile government and city officials may not be able to stop this trend, it is important for them to acknowledge this reality and plan for it, Trachtengot said.\n“How can you prepare for something like this in advance? The first thing is to find the parts of the Haredi population that are interested in living together with other communities and empower them to create an environment of integration instead of a narrative of isolation,” Trachtengot said. “After that, you have to create employment options that are appropriate for their unique needs.”\nThese are realities taking place around the country, Trachtengot noted. “If you don’t plan for it, you are going to continue to see the types of conflict you see in Beit Shemesh and elsewhere.”"}

It’s a luxury mall designed in the style of great European piazzas, sitting in the desert just several kilometers from the ramshackle Khan al-Ahmar Bedouin encampment.\nIt bills itself as a home design center, but entertainment is one of its main markets. And it is helping to drive economic growth for the local municipality, even if its stores are mostly empty.\nWhen The Times of Israel visited D-City on a warm day in February, there was an eerie quiet reminiscent of COVID-era lockdowns. In a mall with 120 stores and 60,000 square meters (646,000 square feet) of commercial space, there weren’t more than several dozen shoppers circulating the complex at a time, according to this reporter’s estimate, and many of the large designer showrooms were empty or closed. Construction being done near the front entrance added to the impression that the shopping center was barely open.\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“It’s very nice here, but I think they need to figure out how to use the potential better,” said Shmuel, another shopper from Jerusalem.\nIsrael’s war against Hamas in Gaza isn’t helping matters, with many Israelis now more reluctant to travel beyond the Green Line due to security factors. Traffic at the mall from Jewish and Arab shoppers, already low before Hamas launched its attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, has since declined about 20%, store owners estimate.\nA view inside the D-City mall, nearly empty of shoppers, on February 26, 2025 (Zev Stub/Times of Israel)\nFor those who invested over NIS 1 billion in a mall that opened less than four years ago with the hopes of becoming one of the country’s most active shopping centers, the quiet is disappointing. But store owners and the building’s management say there is more happening beneath the surface than meets the eye.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“People who are focused on buying furniture know to come here,” said Aviad, who runs two stores in the mall selling mattresses and custom closets. “We opened a year ago, and we get designers and contractors building large apartment complexes all over the country who know that they get a better shopping experience here. I get a lot of sales by phone or online, and people hear about us through word of mouth. Our business only needs to make a few sales a day, and this place attracts the right people.”\nDespite the lack of crowds, many store managers seemed busy during our visit, handling sales calls and managing orders by phone and online. Most we spoke with said they remain committed to the mall, even if foot traffic remains low.\n“We firmly believe in this complex and its future,” said Evgeni Haitovich, vice president of sales at Israeli bedding store Aeroflex, which has 24 showrooms around the country. “People come here because they know they can find everything they need for their homes in one place. Every Israeli company in the home design business should be here.”\nThe interior of D-City, February 26, 2025 (Zev Stub/Times of Israel)\nA different kind of shopping center\nD-City operates by a different set of rules than most shopping centers, said Hanoch Kass, the baby-faced Orthodox Jewish owner whose investment company owns the center.\n“This is a center focused on interior design, and that’s totally different than most malls, where the goal is to have lots of people coming in and buying clothes,” said Kass, whose Kass Group also operates real estate projects in Georgia. “Here, you have architects coming in occasionally to get to know the distributors, and then placing orders by phone of tens of thousands of shekels at a time.”\nTotal revenue for D-City stores in 2024 was a combined NIS 180 million, a respectable figure, but less than in the previous year due to the war, Kass said. A significant upgrade is underway that will add new stores to the mall, including many from outside the home sector, he noted.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnd the shopping mall is just one part of the equation for a massive 200,000-square-meter (2.2 million-square-foot) complex, Kass said. That includes a 150-room hotel (with 100 more rooms under construction), a massive event hall, an amusement park and several entertainment centers, a workspace, a gym, and a spa.\n“Our event hall is full almost every night. We have a wedding for almost 7,000 people tonight,” Kass said in an interview. The massive hall, designed to replicate the famous Venice Hotel in Las Vegas, was originally intended as a food court, “but that doesn’t make sense when the mall doesn’t attract large crowds,” he noted.\nD-City’s event hall, formerly the food court (Courtesy/D-City)\nNonetheless, Kass said, the D-Jump entertainment center located inside the mall is full almost every day, and the nearby Magic Kass amusement park had a million visitors last year. The hotel hosts mainly tour groups, conferences, and army and police functions, but will include the country’s largest spa when construction is completed later this year, he added.\n“Each part of this is working well, and there will be a lot more people coming when we complete our upgrade in September,” Kass said.\nUnmet expectations\nNot everyone in the mall is willing to wait that long. Many stores in the mall have shuttered, with the pace of closures increasing in recent months, shop owners said.\n“When this place first opened, there were people, and sales were coming in,” said Etti, whose Tzemer carpet store was having a liquidation sale in February before the branch was closed. “But after the coronavirus pandemic and the war, there is almost no one here, despite the fact that so much money was invested in it. One store after another has closed, and now we have no choice but to close as well.”\nA store in D-City advertises a clearance sale ahead of its branch closure, February 26, 2025 (Zev Stub/Times of Israel)\nThe mall’s desolation belies the excitement stirring in its halls when it opened in August 2021 to great fanfare. Tens of thousands visited the mall each day during the grand opening, which featured concerts by well-known Israeli singers, street performers, laser light shows, and even a line of cabaret girls dancing in front of the giant fountain at the mall’s entrance.\nWhile many questioned the logic of opening a mall in the desert during the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, others were optimistic that it would replace Jerusalem’s industrial neighborhood of Talpiot as the capital’s center for home products. It seemed logical that D-City’s large modern showrooms and bountiful parking would entice shoppers away from Talpiot and its old, decrepit buildings and limited parking options.\nADVERTISEMENT\nKass predicted at the time that D-City would soon become one of the busiest malls in the country.\nEvgeni Haitovich (Zev Stub/Times of Israel)\nHowever, concerns about safety, a reputation for high prices, and the mall’s physical location outside of the capital have hindered that vision from becoming a reality. The mall now has 40% fewer stores than when it launched, and traffic remains low even as activity in Talpiot remains consistent.\n“We have an Aeroflex branch in Talpiot and a branch here, along with others around the country,” said Haitovich. “Sales are stronger in Talpiot, but one isn’t replacing the other.”\nOne thing that is clear, nonetheless, is that D-City is helping to breathe new life into surrounding businesses.\nWhen it opened in 2021, the surrounding Mishor Adumim industrial zone was rebranded as Park Israel and has since become one of the most active industrial parks in the country, according to a spokesperson for the adjoining Ma’ale Adumim municipality.\n“Commerce in the industrial zone began to develop in 2014 when Rami Levy opened a grocery store branch here, and it has continued to grow steadily since then,” the spokesperson said. “The opening of D-City was a significant and powerful milestone that led to the need for us to change the name.”\nPark Israel is now home to hundreds of stores on an area of about 1,800 dunams (445 acres) of built-up commercial space, the spokesperson said. The industrial park employs about 7,500 people, including about 5,000 Palestinians.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLocals believe that D-City will prove too big to fail and that things will continue to improve at the mall, despite the low traffic.\n“They invested a lot in this place,” said Chen, manager of an electronics store located in the mall since 2022. “Good things take time to develop, and sometimes you need to have patience. There’s no reason it can’t work.”"}

It was passed on March 25.\nHe added that without criticizing those who visited before him, it was not enough to meet with the kibbutz once a week, and that several temporary directors had preceded him.\n“I believe the right thing is to work intensively until the thing is finished,” he said, adding that since starting the job, he had spent more time with Nir Oz than with his wife.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“We all had to sit together for all those hours and get through obstacles to get to the agreement,” he said.\nTekuma Directorate director Aviad Friedman. (Miri Shimonovich, GPO)\nReaching the agreement had required creativity, he went on.

Friedman said it was too early to tell how many buildings would need demolishing, as each house had to be examined first. He promised an answer by Independence Day on May 1, when he hopes a cornerstone will be laid at the kibbutz.\nBut he said he already envisages a second stage, which would take the total number of housing units to 400.\nHe could not say how the budget broke down, explaining that funding calls would determine some elements and that some things had not yet been signed.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe home of the Bibas family in Kibbutz Nir Oz, photographed in January 2025.

After that, detailed work would begin.\nRevealing that he and his wife Hanna were personal friends of the Dekel-Chen family, whose son Sagui was released from Hamas captivity in February, he said that one Friday last month, he and his wife visited Nir Oz and were taken on a three to four hour tour by an 87-year-old kibbutz member in his golf cart.\nA weekly protest calling for the release of Israelis held hostage by the Hamas terror group in Gaza is held in Kiryat Gat, in a neighborhood hosting many evacuated residents of Kibbutz Nir Oz, devastated by last year’s October 7 Hamas attack, October 5, 2024.

They are so courageous, wanting to go back after what they went through.”\nBut the community’s rehabilitation would not be complete until the remaining live hostages and the bodies of hostages were returned home, he said.\nEarlier on Wednesday, a joint statement from Tekuma, the Finance Ministry and MK Ze’ev Elkin, the minister in charge of rehabilitating the southern and northern borders, said the Tekuma Directorate would make an advance payment for the early planning of the new neighborhood, to allow construction to begin as soon as possible.\nThe kibbutz community is currently living in the southern city of Kiryat Gat."}

Such developments allow apartment owners to upgrade their homes at no cost, while the developer funds the project in exchange for the right to build additional housing units for sale.\nWhile these types of urban renewal projects benefit the parties involved and allow the municipality to add new housing units in existing neighborhoods, they often come at the expense of neighborhood residents, who suffer from noise, increased congestion, and greater competition for community resources. As many as 500 skyscrapers planned for the city in the coming years threaten to irreversibly alter the city’s character.\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nLike most neighborhoods, Rasco, located between the Katamon, Givat Mordechai and Pat neighborhoods in central Jerusalem, has a master plan that sets guidelines for urban renewal construction projects, including how many new housing units can be built, how tall buildings can be, and what traffic changes are needed to accommodate additional housing.\nA master plan for the city published in 2000 also defines a vision for the city’s future development.\nHowever, unlike Jerusalem’s Master Plan 62, created in 1959, these master plans are considered by the municipality to be policy statements, not legally binding documents.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“In practice, the municipality and district committees don’t care about the master plan at all,” said Dorit Perry, the neighborhood resident who spearheaded the legal campaign. “They build whatever they want.”\n68 Tchernichovsky Street (Dorit Perry)\nIn most urban renewal construction cases, the municipality receives plans from an investor who has already obtained the agreement of a majority of tenants for the project. But in the case of a plot of land spanning the properties on 68 Tchernichovsky Street and 39 Shimoni Street, the city developed its own plan for urban renewal, which it would have later pitched to investors.\nFirst approved by Jerusalem’s local planning and building committee in October 2020, the plan seeks to knock down a pair of long 4-story housing buildings and replace them with four new buildings, including one 23-story tower and three 10-story buildings. This would nearly triple the number of housing units on the plot from 108 to 298, and add about a thousand people to the neighborhood.\nOne of the proposal’s benefits was that access to the project’s underground parking lot would be from Herzog Street, a large thoroughfare, instead of from Shimoni, a small one-way side street that already suffers from congestion. The plan would have also made the roads on Tchernichovsky and Shimoni wider and added a center for storefronts and public services, including a daycare center.\nA large yard with a garden sits between the buildings on 68 Tchernichovsky Street and 39 Shimoni Street. (Dorit Perry)\nBut there were problems. Firstly, Perry said, the neighborhood master plan only allows buildings of up to eight stories on those streets, due to the neighborhood’s classification as a “historic” area. (More specifically, six floors for a single building and eight stories for a complex with multiple buildings.)\n“We’re not talking about a small deviation,” Perry said. “A building of 23 stories is three times what the master plan allows.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn addition, Perry said, an independent consultant found that the municipality’s plan to divert traffic off Shimoni had “a very low chance of working.” More likely, she said, it would make congestion within the neighborhood much worse.\n“This project would have destroyed the entire neighborhood,” Perry said.\nNeighbors were up in arms over the proposal and led by Perry, 400 objections were filed against the plan.\n“You have to understand that Dorit Perry led this all herself,” said a community council member familiar with the case. “She took the municipality to court and brought hundreds of people to file documents. She got a hundred people to physically come to court with her and raised thousands of shekels from neighbors to hire a lawyer. Winning a case like this requires someone who is extremely driven, and she made it happen.”\n39 Shimoni Street. (Dorit Perry)\nA petition against the plan was initially rejected, and the plan was approved again by the district planning and building committee in August 2024. After the committee rejected a request to appeal the decision, Perry and her partners took the case to the district court, where they argued that the proposal did not comply with the neighborhood’s master plan.\nAn alternative plan, with shorter buildings and more small apartments appropriate for renters and young couples, was also presented.\nIn a hearing last week, Jerusalem District Court Judge Ilan Sela ruled that the city’s plan was invalid, and called on city engineers to design a new proposal that would comply with the master plan. The municipality said in a statement that it accepted the decision and would develop a new plan based on the court’s ruling.\n“This is a unique case of the court ruling against the municipality that has never happened before,” the community council member said. “No neighborhood has ever won a case against a building project because it deviated from the master plan. It sets a precedent that will require investors to be more careful with future projects.”"}

Renters have no shortage of stories about the challenges of finding a decent apartment or of landlords asking for odd or unreasonable contract terms or failing to provide basic home maintenance.\nWith 29 percent of Israelis renting, a figure that is expected to rise in the coming years, the Construction and Housing Ministry tasked Director General Yehuda Morgenstern with formulating a strategic plan to make the long-term rental market work better. The plan was expected at the end of 2024, but the job has proven more complex than expected, and two months later, there is still no target date for its publication, a Housing Ministry spokesperson said.\nWhenever it is delivered, the plan is unlikely to include any of the ambitious legislative changes or far-reaching targets that have been features of various housing reforms announced over the years.\nInstead, the ministry hopes to make order in some key areas of the long-term rental market and recalibrate the industry’s trajectory for the future. Here’s a look at some of the things likely to appear in the strategic plan.\nInstitutional rentals\nWhen talking about long-term housing solutions, you have to differentiate between two types of markets — institutional government rentals and the private market, noted Camila Meyer Weissberg, a Hebrew University Ph.D. student who is writing her dissertation on Israel’s long-term rental housing policy.\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe vast majority of Israeli tenants rent their homes privately from individuals who own them. This is different from what occurs in most Western countries, where apartment complexes are often designed exclusively for renters and managed by companies that offer standardized contracts and transparent rules about price increases.\nIn 2013, Finance Minister Yair Lapid, new to the Knesset after his Yesh Atid party’s stunning election performance, put forward a plan to create long-term rental complexes where residential units would be rented for five to 10 years at a time. The plan envisioned the development of as many as 150,000 units where renters would pay below-market prices for homes.\nHowever, the reality that emerged has been different. Only about 18,000 units have actually been built to date, serving less than 1% of the rental market. The problem is that the model isn’t worthwhile economically for developers.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“These projects take a lot of capital to develop, they deliver poor annual returns, and you have to wait 20 years or more before you can sell it,” Meyer Weissberg explained. “It’s not a worthwhile investment for contractors or the banks.”\nCamila Meyer Weissberg. (Courtesy)\nPart of the challenge is the low cost of renting in Israel in relation to the purchase value of a property compared to other countries. While income from a rental complex in Europe or the US typically delivers annual returns of 6-7% on the initial investment, this type of project in Israel might return only about 2%. It also means that even if such a project could be viable when interest rates were nearly zero several years ago, it doesn’t work in an era of high interest rates.\nAnother issue is that the program was conceived as a solution to the cost-of-living crisis dominating Israel’s public debate at the time, Meyer Weissberg explained,\n“The idea was to offer housing at 20% or so below market value to the middle class, which was struggling with rising home prices.” Meyer Weissberg said. “By creating a new supply of discounted housing options, there was hope it could help reduce prices throughout the entire market.”\nBecause so few projects were developed, however, that plan failed to materialize, and only a small number of households chosen by lottery to live in these projects benefit from the program, she noted.\nDespite the challenges, the Construction and Housing Ministry is committed to finding ways to make the system work, including bringing into the market large investment funds that can afford to wait decades to see their returns on investment.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Even though these housing projects are moving slower than planned, there is a general understanding that we don’t have a choice,” Meyer Weissberg said. “As more people move to renting and prices continue to rise, even policy-makers and municipalities that were skeptical 10 years ago are now interested. The need is clear, and the government wants to make it work.”\nIsraelis protest against soaring housing prices in Tel Aviv and the cost of living, on July 2, 2022. (Tomer Neuberg/Flash90)\nPrivate renters\nThe vast majority of renters in Israel have one-year contracts with a private landlord, often an individual who bought the property as an investment or for future use. For many, problems can start there.\nOne of the spurs of Israel’s massive price-of-living protests in 2011 was when then-25-year-old video editor Daphne Leef was evicted from her apartment for building renovations. When the renovations were complete, the landlord told her she couldn’t move back in because his son wanted to live there. When she couldn’t find affordable housing, she took to the streets.\nThat type of short-term planning by owners is typical in Israel, said Nachi Paris, a Jerusalem-based real estate agent.\n“Unlike in the US, it is very rare to see a landlord here offer a rental contract for three to five years,” Paris said. “Because selling can be so lucrative, even long-term owners don’t want to lock themselves into long-term commitments where they will be unable to sell at a high price. So contracts are typically one to two years maximum.”\nThe Construction and Housing Ministry is said to be formulating a plan to encourage owners to offer longer-term contracts, likely with tax incentives. However, it is not yet clear how it will do so.\n“Tax incentives are not always successful, and it is not clear what types of incentives would work in this case,” said Oriya Shohat, a Jerusalem-based attorney specializing in real estate law. “Often, attempts to try to intervene in the real estate market end up making things worse. The best tool the government has to influence the real estate market is to tweak the supply and demand.”\nOriya Shohat (Courtesy)\nMeanwhile, Israel’s laws regulating the rental market are among the most lax in the Western world, with minimal laws regulating pricing or other terms in a rental contract.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“In many countries, a rental agreement is required to have certain terms, and needs notarized in order to be recognized,” said Meyer Weissberg. “Here, you can put almost anything you want in the contract.”\nThe 2017 Fair Rental Law sought to establish a baseline to define minimal requirements for livable apartments and fair terms in a rental contract. However, the experiences of many renters attest to the fact that these standards are not always followed.\nWhile many cities in Israel offer rental contract templates to landlords, the plan is expected to recommend improvements.\nCollecting more accurate data about the rental market is another target of the ministry’s plan. Rental information published by the Central Bureau of Statistics is generally seen as inaccurate, as many landlords do not or are not required to report their earnings. Many now look to sites like Madlan or WeCheck for real-time market information. The ministry requires a plan to gather higher-quality information to guide renters and its own policy-making.\nAware of the challenges, the Construction and Housing Ministry hopes to deliver a realistic and nuanced framework to straighten out the rental market in the near future.\n“People want stability and long-term living security, regardless of whether they rent from a company or an individual,” Morgenstern told a real estate industry conference last month. “We just have to identify what works.”"}

This feels more secure for them and is probably the most low-risk for investors in the Dubai market,” added Doodman, who said the most popular areas he recommends are Jumeirah Village Circle (also known as JVC), Dubai Marina, Downtown Dubai and Business Bay.\nWhile most buyers are taking one- or two-bedroom apartments, which range between NIS 1-2 million ($279,000-$258,000), rental returns are between NIS 110,000-120,000 ($30,000-$33,000) annually, before deducting for costs such as monthly building service fees. “We can rent these out very quickly with a great yield,” said Doodman.\nDubai-based Idan Doodman works with Israeli investors in the UAE and in Israel who want to take advantage of the economic opportunities presented by the Abraham Accords.

Some investors have held back, but for those with another passport [besides Israeli], they were able to continue and feel more secure.”\nCars pass by the Business Bay Towers, July 28, 2015, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. (AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili)\nEyal Ashur, a young Israeli agent now based in Dubai, said the return on investment has lured many Israelis from all social segments, hoping to get a profitable return in the tax haven.\n“If you’re doing the same in Tel Aviv you’re lucky to get 3%, whereas in Dubai it’s at minimum 5-6%,” he said.\nMost of Ashur’s clients, as with Doodman’s, invest between NIS 1-2 million for studios to two-bedroom apartments, with all the capital gain tax-free in UAE (but not necessarily in Israel).\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Israelis love JVC and Business Bay. I would always advise clients to stop investing in JVC and look more toward places like, for example, The Valley by Emaar,” Ashur said, referring to a luxurious gated community on the city’s southeastern outskirts.\nEyal Ashur is an Israeli real estate agent who now lives in Dubai. (Courtesy)\n“There is a big shortage of townhouses in Dubai,” Ashur said. “I would also advise investing in District One or Creek Harbour, but mostly, it’s a bit above budget. If I have a big investor, I would suggest investing in the Jumeirah coastline, but they’re very different numbers.”\nThere are natural concerns, Ashur said, in the midst of the war and in the wake of the kidnapping and murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogen last November, a Chabad rabbi whose death shook the community. But as a millionaires’ playground, the UAE remains a safe place to invest, Ashur said.\n“The UAE is a safe haven for everybody,” said Ashur. “If they will exclude one group of people, others will start to have shaky thoughts about the UAE. Millionaires from all over the world are coming here.”\nLast May, Henley & Partners, which tracks private wealth and investment migration, said Dubai contains the Middle East’s highest concentration of resident millionaires with 72,500, ranking it as the 21st wealthiest city in the world.\nA floating restaurant is seen decked up as it is is anchored at Dubai Marina Walk in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, August 13, 2024. (AP Photo/Altaf Qadri)\n“So when people speak to me about the peace agreement falling apart, I don’t think that will happen,” said Ashur. “If [the UAE] ends that treaty and Israelis have problems with their money, what are the Russians, the Iranians, the Pakistanis, going to think?

However, the central bank said, the trend has intensified in recent months, posing increased risk for buyers and developers and possibly even the banking system.\nSuch arrangements are now used in 50 percent of all new housing purchases, compared to 20% before the war, the Bank of Israel said in February. These types of loans are risky because they encourage buyers to make purchases they might be unable to complete, it explained.\nFor deferred payment plans, in which more than 25% of the sales price is not due until the delivery of the home at the end of construction, the banks financing the developers must show increased readiness for the possibility that the sale might fall through.

Now, that same apartment costs between NIS 12,000 and 13,000 [$3,364 and $3,645].”\nYou can find apartments listed in the NIS 8,000 ($2,243) range online, “but those are usually a top-floor walk-up, or it isn’t renovated or doesn’t have parking,” Kowalsky added. “If you are looking for the whole package, with a balcony and an elevator, it’s at least NIS 12,000 [$3,364], and it will get rented as soon as it goes on the market.”\nEric Opland, real estate director at L.

If you are looking for a place, you have to start early.”\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nMuch of the reason for the surge is an increase in immigration from American and French Jews in response to rising antisemitism, agents said. During the first 10 months of 2024, immigration from the United States rose 12% to 2,786 new arrivals, while immigration from France rose a whopping 79% to 1,846 people, according to Jewish Agency figures.\nEric Opland, real estate director at L Levy Nadlan (Courtesy)\nJudith Ben Avi, who runs a real estate agency specializing in Jerusalem rentals, said many of the new arrivals prefer to rent a place in Jerusalem for a few years before they commit to buying. “The problem is that they’ll pay anything, and that drives up prices for everyone,” she said.\nKowalsky had a somewhat different take on it. Many of the older immigrants moving to Jerusalem had already bought properties in the city as investments and rented them out. When they arrive, their tenants are forced to move, making fewer properties available.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnother significant contributor is the popularity of urban renewal projects in which apartment buildings are renovated or rebuilt at no cost to the owner, by allowing the contractor to build extra apartments to sell as an investment.\nYitzchak Kowalsky, CEO of YKK Jerusalem Real Estate (Courtesy)\n“A lot of Jerusalem residents have evacuated their homes while they are rebuilt under a Tama 38 or Pinui Binui plan,” Kowalsky said, referring to two such programs. “For each project, you get a large number of families that are looking to rent another place in their neighborhood for a few years until construction is completed. The market doesn’t have enough supply to allow for that. And the fact that a lot of construction is being delayed due to the shortage of workers available since October 7 makes it even worse.”\nThe hottest markets are the central historical neighborhoods like Talbieh and Rehavia, along with nearby Mamilla, Opland said. Immigrants with a bit less money to spend go to Givat Mordechai or Har Homa, Ben Avi added.\nDue to the country’s ongoing security situation, most renters insist on selecting apartments with a safe room to protect them in the case of rocket attacks, Opland noted. “That’s the most important thing, even more than an open Sukkah balcony is for religious Jews,” he said.\nThe challenge for students\nThe upturn in rental prices can be tough on university students and young adults moving to the city. Jerusalem is a top destination for students who come to learn at Hebrew University, Israel’s top-rated university, as well as other institutions such as Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School, and Hadassah College of Technology.\nJudith Ben Avi, owner of JBA Real Estate (Courtesy)\n“Most of them are sharing apartments,” Ben Avi said. “You see three people splitting an old apartment near Azza Street for NIS 9,000 [$2,523], sharing the bills. Their prices have gone up too, although they receive big discounts on property taxes.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe most desirable neighborhood in Jerusalem for students is the center, with nearly 40% of its students making it their home while they study, according to the Madlan real estate website.\nOpland noted that with rental prices rising so quickly, owners have become more flexible about the length of rental contracts. “People used to insist on a commitment of a year or longer from the tenant,” he said. “But now they are open to shorter contracts since they know they’ll be able to rent their apartment out for even more after the tenant leaves.”"}

As foreign and local buyers assess their options and confront new tax realities, the question is how sharp the rise will be.\nChaim Friedman, co-founder and managing director of First Israel Group, a boutique mortgage brokerage based in Jerusalem, expects home prices to spike as much as 10-15% this year around the country.\n“There’s a lot of demand that hasn’t been realized in previous years due to the fact that a lot of people put their lives on hold during the war,” he said. “Demand is going to return in the north and the south, where the markets have been pretty much frozen, and people are going to return to the market to buy homes to live in or as an investment. I think it’s going to be a very strong year.”\nNot everyone agrees.

That means it is still a good investment, but prices aren’t rising so fast that if you don’t buy now, you’ll miss the boat. You missed the boat because you didn’t buy in 2016, but that’s behind us now.”\nWith economic data for December 2024 not yet available, the Central Bureau of Statistics says housing prices in Israel have risen by 7.8% over the previous 12 months, continuing a growth trend that has continued for most of the past two decades.\nChaim Friedman, co-founder and managing director of First Israel Group (Courtesy)\nA combination of factors — including a longstanding housing shortage, strong population growth, and growing foreign investment — has kept demand high, even as the conflict disrupts construction and economic stability.\nADVERTISEMENT\nInflation for the 12 months through November was 3.4%, and is expected to average 2.6% for 2025 after rising faster during the first quarter of the year, the Bank of Israel said earlier this month.\nGeopolitical factors including the Gaza ceasefire, the government’s approval of the national budget, the routing of Hezbollah and the ceasefire in the north have reduced the country’s risk premium looking forward, Bank of Israel governor Amir Yaron said.\nA project under construction in Jerusalem’s Kiryat Menachem neighborhood (LSA Lazarovich Studio of Architects)\nRising costs of building\nThe cost of building new homes has skyrocketed since October 7, 2023, after Israel barred the West Bank Palestinians who have traditionally comprised most of the construction labor force.\nWork on many sites has stopped or slowed as contractors have been unable to replace lost laborers with those from other countries.\nNahum Langental, head of the HuMantra Group and a former MK.(Courtesy)\n“Israel has brought in workers from China or India, as well as Arab Israelis, but there aren’t enough, and the government hasn’t fulfilled its promises to bring in more,” said Nahum Langental, head of the HuMantra Group and a former Knesset member. “In any case, they are much more expensive to employ. A Palestinian Arab costs a company about NIS 20,000 [$5,581] per month to employ, while an Arab Israeli costs NIS 25,000 [$6,976], and a Chinese worker costs NIS 30,000 [$8,372] per month.”\nBuilding materials such as cement, stones, and sand are also more expensive after rising for several years, Langental said.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The global market will be focused on supplying these materials to Gaza, Syria, and Lebanon, which will make them even more expensive here,” he predicted. “The cost of these materials has already increased by 6%, and it could rise another 6%.”\nThat means newer apartments will cost much more than secondhand ones, making them less attractive to buyers. The number of unsold new apartments in Israel reached a record high of more than 70,000 units in November, according to CBS.\n“The price of construction has gone through the roof,” Friedman said. “The cost of mid to high-end construction had doubled to as much as NIS 25,000 per square meter [$652 per square foot]. That’s just going to fuel future price increases.”\nHot markets\nWhile CBS data shows a majority of apartments being sold in the country’s central district, the hottest markets for high-end sales are in Jerusalem and Netanya, Friedman said.\n“The area around Tel Aviv has been rather weak, relatively speaking,” Friedman said. “People don’t want to buy an expensive home in places where missile sirens are relatively common. Jerusalem and Netanya are slightly out of the range of most rockets, and people there are less worried about the short-term risks related to the war.”\nFriedman called Netanya “the nicest city that is affordable near the coast,” and noted that more US buyers are choosing to live there instead of just investing in properties. Apartments in Netanya are half the price of those in Tel Aviv per square foot, and 30-40% less than in Herzliya, he added.\nThe Jerusalem municipality is engaged in an ambitious growth plan that will increase the city’s population by 300,000 in the next 15 years, Paris noted. The city already has aggressive plans to build nearly 500 new skyscrapers above 18 stories, compared to just 30 today, and upgrade its urban infrastructure to handle all of it.\nThat and virtually insatiable demand from foreign buyers will ensure that prices in the capital keep rising, Paris said.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“It’s going to be crazy,” he said. “I see a lot of demand for pre-sales on new projects, and there is a never-ending infusion of money from America. Everyone in the US who can afford it wants to buy an apartment in Jerusalem.”\nNachi Paris, owner of Nachi Realty in Jerusalem (Courtesy)\nParis added another recommendation for investors. “I think Ashkelon is a very good investment, especially for someone who wants to invest in Israel’s postwar rebuilding,” he said. “It is 30% cheaper than Ashdod because of the fear of rockets from Gaza, but it is 20 kilometers [12 miles] down the road and has the same type of population. You can find apartments on the water in good neighborhoods starting at NIS 1.5 million [$418,600].”\nParis discouraged investors from seeking properties in towns in the north or south, saying there isn’t much available and the market is not very strong. Properties in northern cities like Acre or Kiryat Shmona are risky, depending on what happens with Hezbollah in the future, he added.\nLangental, meanwhile, recommended properties in Lod, where his company is currently building 800 units starting at NIS 1.8 million ($502,310) for a three-room apartment.\nIllustrative: Multistory residential buildings in Ashkelon, Israel, May 2022. (rglinsky via iStock by Getty Images)\nTax increases\nHome buyers are going to pay more taxes in 2025 after the government passed several reforms that will help it raise the money to pay for the war.\nVAT was raised from 17% to 18% at the beginning of January, affecting the purchase price of new construction properties and commercial real estate transactions. That means a buyer will now pay NIS 10,000 ($2,790) more in taxes for every million shekels of the purchase price.\nLooking to beat the tax increase, Israelis took a record NIS 13.8 billion ($3.85 billion) in mortgages in December 2024 to get their purchases completed before the deadline. This included a record NIS 3.2 billion ($893 million) taken in balloon loans required by contractors in cases when the buyer put a 10% or 20% down payment for a home under construction.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“A lot of those were taken because, if you are going to need to take that kind of loan anytime soon, it’s best to take it before taxes go up,” Friedman explained.\nThe VAT increase doesn’t directly affect the sale of secondhand homes, although it may influence price levels across the general market. It also affects service fees for lawyers, architects, and other professional services.\nOther reforms will also be costly for some.\nView of luxury towers in Tel Aviv. (Miriam Alster/Flash90)\nHigh-income sellers with annual incomes will pay higher capital gains taxes on property sales. Currently in Israel, a “wealth tax” of 3% is levied on individuals with annual incomes of more than NIS 721,560 ($201,359). Starting in 2025, an additional 2% surtax will also be imposed on capital gains of that amount for people fitting into that category.\nAdditionally, the government has frozen purchase tax brackets for 2025. Normally, these brackets are adjusted every year to reflect inflation rates. By keeping the brackets the same as last year, some buyers will effectively pay higher taxes.\nFriedman noted that a reform passed in August gives new immigrants a huge tax break on their first apartment that may virtually eliminate purchase taxes for acquisitions of up to NIS 6 million ($1.7 million)."}

Since then the family has spent the Passover and Sukkot holidays in their second home, despite the continuing threat of rocket and missile attacks on Israel from Iran-backed groups in Gaza, Lebanon and around the region.\nBuying a property in Israel was always a dream for the Azrans. Both had spent time in Israel on youth programs as teenagers, and when they married, they lived in Israel for a while. The idea was to someday return, said Marc Azran.\nThe push came after the October 7 events, he said, because the couple felt the need to “be connected” and support Israel, he said. Though they continue to live in the US, they now have a home to visit in Israel, and hope to eventually move there.\n“I feel like it’s time for the Jewish people to be in Israel, and I want to be part of that destiny, and I want my children to be part of that destiny,” Azran said over the phone as he drove to his job where he works as an anesthesiologist. “I do not feel that there is a bright future for Jews in America and in Europe, in the long term.”\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nAccording to official figures, the Azrans are just one of hundreds of foreign residents who have snapped up homes in Israel since the start of fighting some 15 months ago.

(Courtesy: Jeff Kalwerisky.)\nAntisemitic incidents have surged around the world since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in which terrorists from the Gaza Strip invaded and killed some 1,200 people, took 251 hostages and triggered the ongoing war there.\nAccording to data published in November by the Finance Ministry, foreign residents in September acquired 254 apartments in Israel, a sharp increase of 119 percent compared to September last year, and the highest level of acquisitions since July 2022, when the market was infused with post-COVID optimism and a lower tax rate.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHome purchases by foreigners dropped steeply in October 2023 in the wake of the attack and war, official figures show, but quickly rebounded, reaching pre-war levels by December. They mostly continued to rise throughout the year before the September surge.\n“After October 7, for one month, there was nothing…. It was dead, nobody was calling,” said Donny Fein, a real estate agent who owns the Elite Israel Realty firm which focuses on the Beit Shemesh area. “It took about three or four weeks, [and then] the phones did not stop ringing.”\nDonny Fein. (Courtesy: Jared Bernstein)\nFein should know, Beit Shemesh and the larger Jerusalem area are ground zero for the resurgent foreign buyer phenomenon, making up over half the properties purchased by foreigners in September. In Beit Shemesh alone, 87 apartments were purchased by non-residents in September, outstripping even the capital despite being less than a fifth of its size.\nA Brooklyn native who immigrated to Israel, Fein said some customers had bought homes in Israel without ever visiting them in person. The buyers aren’t necessarily looking for their dream home, but rather to have a safe haven in their back pocket should trouble strike and they need to flee, he said. Until then, the foreign owners generally rent out their units on short-term leases of two years or less, to keep their options open.\n“They call it the Mashiach clause,” Fein said, making joking reference to the messianic yearning for Israel deeply ingrained in Jewish Orthodox theology. While standard contracts in Israel contain no such clause accounting for the possibility of divine salvation, it’s an idea in the back of many buyers’ minds, according to Fein.\nIllustrative: Students protest on the street after police close the student plaza during an anti-Israel demonstration over the war in Gaza at the George Washington University in Washington, April 26, 2024.

This is what they say.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nForeign home purchases in Israel are nothing new, and even with the surge in September, levels remain far below their 2005 high, when some 1,400 homes were sold to foreigners in a single fiscal quarter. But many in Israel also see the purchases as a scourge, taking properties off a market where demand already exceeds supply and driving prices higher. Foreign acquisitions in luxury complexes are also often kept as vacation homes rather than being rented out, turning whole buildings in prime locations into dimly lit shells for much of the year.\nBuilders working on the Mamilla luxury apartments, situated across from David’s Village, both considered to be part of Jerusalem’s “ghost apartments.” (photo credit: Rebecca Zeffert/Flash 90)\nBut since October 7, experts believe the purchases are being fueled by the same antisemitism fears driving immigration to Israel even as war rages.\nAccording to data published by the Aliyah and Integration Ministry and the Jewish Agency, some 31,000 new immigrants came to Israel from around the world between September 2023 and September 2024. Most of the immigrants were from Russia, North America, France, Ukraine, Belarus and Britain, the figures show.\nThe city that absorbed the most immigrants was Netanya, followed by Tel Aviv, Haifa, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, and Ashdod.\nNew immigrants from France arrive on a special “Aliyah Flight” at Ben Gurion Airport in central Israel on August 1, 2024.

But Netanel Shuchner, the CEO of real estate firm RMA-ET, said his company has seen a sharp rise in demand from foreign residents for homes in Israel, mainly in Tel Aviv and Ra’anana.\nMany of the prospective buyers are from the US and France, and Shuchner predicted even more people would also begin looking for homes in Israel following a wave of anti-Jewish and anti-Israel violence that rocked Amsterdam when the Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team visited for a match.\n“Following the recent events in Amsterdam I expect we will see a further rise in demand,” said Shuchner, who is also a lecturer in economics and real estate valuations at the College of Management Academic Studies.\nNetanel Shuchner.

While rising antisemitism in the US was not a driving factor, he admitted it may have played a role as he and his wife decided on the purchase. “It is not a conscious thing, but it definitely was in the back of our minds.”\nWhatever the pull, it is strong enough to motivate buyers to pay above-market prices in order to have a home in Israel rather than anywhere else, Fein noted. He called it an “emotional premium.”\n“People always said to me it’s not safe in Israel, but I always said at least in Israel we know who your enemies are,” he said. “In America, you could be walking down some random street and some crazy guy who hates Jews can literally just knock you out.”"}

This paradox has raised questions: How can demand for housing remain robust in a country embroiled in such turmoil?\nA combination of factors — including a long-standing housing shortage, strong population growth, and growing foreign investment — has kept demand high, even as the conflict disrupts construction and economic stability. While the market remains hot, it’s creating significant challenges for first-time buyers, who are increasingly priced out of central cities.\nAccording to the most recent Alrov Housing Affordability Index, the second quarter of 2024 saw housing prices reach levels of unaffordability nearly on par with the peak recorded during the second quarter of 2023. The report, which measures housing affordability based on mortgage repayments and down payments required for entry into the market, highlights the growing challenge for many Israelis seeking home ownership.\nDanny Ben-Shahar, co-author of the report and director of the Alrov Institute for Real Estate Research at Tel Aviv University’s Coller School of Management, explained that the sharp rise in prices began long before the war.\n“Looking at the past decade, we see that prices began increasing around 2007, with a brief stabilization before 2020.

People are still investing in Israeli real estate,” Ben-Shahar said. Data from the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics corroborates the claim, revealing that prices have continued to rise by six to seven percent per year.\nDanny Ben-Shahar, director of the Alrov Institute for Real Estate Research at Tel Aviv University’s Coller School of Management. (Courtesy/ Micha Loubaton)\nA complex web of economic forces\nTo understand this anomaly, experts point to a combination of macroeconomic factors that extend beyond the war. Nir Mualam, a professor of architecture and urban planning at Haifa’s Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, noted that even before the conflict, housing prices had risen dramatically due to systemic issues within the Israeli market.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The key problem is a chronic shortage of housing units, which existed long before the war,” he said. “The Israeli planning system simply cannot produce enough housing to meet demand.”\nIsrael’s booming population, among the highest in the developed world, further fuels this demand. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, Israel’s population grew by 1.6% in 2023 alone.\n“With 2.6 million households in Israel, we need an additional 55,000-65,000 homes annually just to keep pace with population growth,” Ben-Shahar said.\nIllustrative: A maternity ward in an Israeli hospital. (Flash90)\nYet, even this demand cannot be met. Mualam points to a growing trend of “housing units on paper” — a system where buyers commit to properties before they are built, providing developers with upfront payments but with no guarantees on delivery timelines. This practice has created a speculative housing market, where prices continue to rise based on expectations rather than completed construction.\nThe war’s impact on the construction sector\nThe war has exacerbated the housing shortage, primarily due to disruptions in the construction sector. Palestinian workers, who make up a significant portion of the workforce in Israeli construction, have largely disappeared from the market since October 2023. This shortage of labor has brought many ongoing projects to a halt. Mualam notes that even before the war, the COVID-19 pandemic had already constrained the ability to produce new housing, as fewer workers from the West Bank and Gaza entered Israel’s major cities.\nMoreover, as the war has intensified, construction companies face additional delays due to the mobilization of business owners and employees for military reserve duty. This has affected the ability to plan and execute new developments.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFor instance, when reached for comment, the head of H.K.R. Construction Group in Kfar Saba responded via text message, explaining that he was currently serving in the reserves in the north and unavailable to discuss the impact on his company. Such disruptions illustrate the far-reaching effects of the conflict on the housing sector.\nRising interest rates and international demand\nAnother factor contributing to the high cost of housing in Israel is the recent surge in interest rates. Ben-Shahar noted that the ongoing war has led to a rise in Israel’s risk premium, which in turn has caused a significant downgrade in the country’s credit rating. As the central bank keeps interest rates high to combat inflation, the cost of homeownership continues to climb.\nYet, unlike in other countries, inflation expectations in Israel remain stubbornly high.\n“Talks of further interest rate hikes are ongoing,” Ben-Shahar said, suggesting that the situation may worsen before it improves.\nInterestingly, while local demand for real estate has softened somewhat due to the war and the economic challenges it has brought, foreign interest in Israeli properties has surged.\nReal estate broker Yuri Wolosov with the Armon Real Estate Agency in Bat Yam reported a noticeable influx of buyers from abroad, particularly from the United States and France.\nA view of the luxury apartment neighborhood of Mamila in Jerusalem, on October 27, 2015. (Lior Mizrahi/Flash90)\n“I’m getting calls from wealthy Jewish clients in New York and Paris looking to purchase properties in Israel, often not for immediate use but as a hedge against rising antisemitism in their home countries,” Wolosov said.\nIndeed, the Anti-Defamation League has documented more than 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the United States since October 7, 2023, a 60% increase from the previous year. “People are scared,” Wolosov added. “The feeling is that something worse is coming.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nDespite these fears, the wealthy clients with whom he works do not hesitate to spend. “They’re buying homes worth 4 or 5 million shekels — about $1.5 million — without a mortgage,” he said. “These are not cheap properties.”\nA crisis for first-time buyers\nFor young, first-time homebuyers, the current market presents an almost insurmountable challenge. Ben-Shahar admitted that the situation is dire, especially for those looking to settle in Israel’s central areas.\n“We are already seeing a large portion of Israeli households unable to afford homes in central cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, forcing them to look toward peripheral areas like Beersheba or Haifa,” he said.\nThe high cost of housing, combined with soaring interest rates, means that many first-time buyers find themselves squeezed out of the market.\n“These rising prices and high interest rates create a situation that is simply untenable for new households trying to enter the market,” said Ben-Shahar.\nAn ultra-Orthodox woman reads a book next to her baby carriage on the beach (Tsafrir Abayov/Flash90)\nA shift in homebuyer priorities\nThe war has also influenced what homebuyers are looking for. Wolosov notes that, among those still purchasing homes, there is a growing demand for new properties with built-in safe rooms, known as a mamad, reflecting heightened security concerns. For some, upgrading existing homes to include reinforced safe rooms has become a priority, especially for those unable to relocate.\nEli Perlowitz, an independent contractor specializing in home renovations in Jerusalem through his company Jerusalem Construction, confirmed the increased demand for safe room upgrades.\n“I’m seeing more requests from clients wanting to fortify their safe rooms. Some even want bomb shelters installed in their backyards,” Perlowitz said. “In this new reality, having a secure space in your home has become the most important housing amenity.”"}

What was happening was that malls became more like service providers in a way, to bring in traffic,” said Oren Paran, managing director of the Retail Innovation Club. “You have kupat holim [HMOS], and you have the dentist and the hairdresser. People are coming more weekly and bi-weekly. This makes more small businesses come into the malls.”\nThe diversity in storefronts inside an Israeli mall is what has kept them booming during extremely dark times.\nSign up for ToI's free\nReal Estate Israel newsletter\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“It is not only for shopping but also for social gatherings, for family, to escape the war,” said Ofir Oren, cluster manager of Azrieli Group’s Tel Aviv properties.\nWhile sales and traffic have since recovered, the Azrieli Group offered support for all businesses in the days and months immediately following the October 7 infiltration of southern Israel in which Hamas killed 1,200 and abducted 251 hostages to the Gaza Strip.\nPeople shopping at the Azrieli Mall in Tel Aviv during the municipal elections, February 27, 2024. (Flash90)\nEfforts included rent reductions in October and November, spaces in its malls made available for displaced businesses, and temporary schools in Azrieli-owned buildings for in-need families.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMeanwhile, in the United States, “the mall is dead” is a common phrase uttered by customers and retailers alike. The origin of the modern mall is currently home to around 1,150 centers, according to a May study from Capital One. That number is projected to diminish to as few as 150 malls by 2032. Malls in the US are twice as likely to be vacant when compared to the average retail space, a trend largely blamed on the shift towards e-commerce.\nHowever, reports of the mall’s death may be greatly exaggerated: Retail experts and research show the rise of e-commerce to be grossly overstated, with some indications that shoppers are actually returning to physical stores. In a study released Wednesday from Ryder System, 61 percent of consumers said they prefer in-store shopping for the experience of trying on products, comparing items and beyond, up 21% from last year’s study.\nNew ‘unique lifestyle complexes’ on the way\nDespite a year of war and uncertainty, the Israeli mall continues to boom and new mega centers are actively popping up and experiencing high traffic thanks to the more holistic approach.\nBIG Fashion Glilot, is set to finish construction in November. At 30,000 square meters of commerce and the largest BIG center in Israel, the new space has been labeled as a “unique lifestyle complex” with “an international-level shopping and entertainment experience.”\nBIG is one of the leading mall developers in the country, founded in 1994 to develop “American-style open-air shopping centers in Israel.” Yet BIG has taken the American mall and done it better.\nView of the new BIG shopping center, near Glilot, June 3, 2024. (Yossi Aloni/FLASH90)\n“It’s really a lifestyle. Every store has its own unique facade. The environment is like you’re going inside a street with lots of vegetation and balconies and water elements,” BIG Shopping Centers chief of staff Etay Elder said of the company’s open-air centers, focusing on how crucial fresh air and sunshine are to the success of Israeli centers.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDespite massive dips in revenue and performance around October 7, several mall developers have shown impressive growth over the past year. In its second-quarter results, the Azrieli Group reported sales were up NIS 46 million from a year ago, though revenue and net income was lower. The Melsiron company, which owns and manages malls across Israel, is up 16% over the last year.\nWhy is it that the malls continue to thrive?\n“Israelis love to shop,” said the Retail Innovation Club’s Paran.\nAnd with fewer Israelis flying abroad due to challenging skies, canceled flights and uncertainty, that love of shopping can only be sated locally.\n“Israelis are not going abroad so a lot of money is staying inside the country,” said Azrieli Group’s Oren, who also stressed that malls operate as a safe space for customers during an anxious time.\n“The economy is very, very strong. Even now with a war going on, the economy is strong,” said Oren."}

According to the research by Prof. Danny Ben-Shahar, director of the Alrov Institute for Real Estate Research at Tel Aviv University’s Coller School of Management, and Dr. David Ash, a research associate at the institute, those listing homes on Yad2, the leading classified services site in Israel, lose out on a wad of extra cash, despite saving money while posting the initial advertisement.\nBy analyzing over 15,000 listings between 2014 and 2016 on Yad2, Ben-Shahar and Ash found a noticeable gap between paid and free ad services: properties listed through paid services sold for 3.5 percent to 3.8% more than those using free listings. That’s an average of $12,000 to $13,000 earned.\nHomes sold via paid ads also got more attention and moved faster, gaining 130% higher clicks than those listed on free ads and selling 10% to 18% quicker.\nThe study put the “zero price effect” on full display. This psychological bias shows that people place a heavy weight on things being free, even when spending some money could have a larger financial benefit long term.

People feel and think that a service or product that they get for free has better qualities, even if you give them the same product or the same service for a difference of one cent,” Ash told The Times of Israel. “The ‘free’ is the problem. When someone sees free, it’s hard. If you see a free service, you think it’s better, even though the premium service that costs money is much better.”\nLeft: Prof. Danny Ben-Shahar, director of the Alrov Institute for Real Estate Research at Tel Aviv University’s Coller School of Management.

(Courtesy)\nWhile residential real estate can still be listed for free, Yad2 began charging for its previously free basic package for commercial real estate in 2019, as well as upped the cost of the higher-tier premium service. After eliminating the chance to opt for an entirely free service, “a very significant difference” in the number of sellers selected the more costly of the two available for-pay options, putting the behavioral economics of home sales and pricing on display.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPrior to the change, 94% of sellers chose the basic option — which was free at the time. But after the basic option was no longer free, only 85.7% opted for it, showing that once users had to spend any kind of money, they were willing to spend more. The “free” option had been the only thing in the way.\nBen-Shahar says the study as a whole serves as a warning for homeowners looking to sell to pay attention to their own biases and think logically when making selling decisions.\n“The tendency to be attracted to a zero price, one needs to be very cautious,” Ben-Shahar told The Times of Israel. “Generally, we do a cost-benefit analysis, but when things come to a zero price, we don’t do this analysis in the same way.”\nEven though the ad is free, Ben-Shahar points out the deeper truth: “There is a cost.”"}

Israel remains opposed, however, to any deal that would require serious negotiations on a permanent end to the war, given what is currently off the table, such as Hamas leaving the Strip.\nA source who was present for the discussions told the network that though there was pessimism about the prospects of the fresh negotiations, coalition heads authorized Netanyahu to send the delegation, although National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich were opposed.\n‘Hopefully, the first step to end this brutal conflict’\nTrump, speaking shortly before Alexander was freed from Hamas captivity, said that the hostage soldier’s release would be part of a wider effort to return all remaining captives — 58, excluding Alexander, of whom at least 20 are believed to be alive — and end the 19-month war.\n“This was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators — Qatar and Egypt — to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n“Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict. I look very much forward to that day of celebration!” he added.\nAsked later by a reporter whether Alexander’s release would be a step toward a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, Trump said, “We hope that we’re going to have other hostages released.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nSeparately, when answering a question about the Qatari ruling family offering to gift him a Boeing 747, the US president said he has “a lot of respect for the leadership” and “a lot of respect for the leader” of the Gulf state.\nUS President Donald Trump gestures while answering a reporter’s question during an event in the Roosevelt Room at the White House on May 12, 2025, in Washington.

Hamas alone is responsible for the continued death and suffering. We demand the immediate release of all remaining hostages,” he wrote.\nTrump’s special envoy on hostages, Adam Boehler, traveled to Israel on Monday with Edan Alexander’s mother, and said from the plane that the hostage soldier’s release is just “the start” and that he will not rest until all captives are returned home.\n“[US] President [Donald] Trump, when he told me to go get back every hostage, every Israeli, he wasn’t kidding,” Boehler said.\nEarlier, Boehler said news of Alexander’s release was a positive step forward. “We would also ask that Hamas release the bodies of four other Americans that were taken,” he then added.\nAmerican-Israelis Itay Chen, Gadi Haggai, Judih Weinstein Haggai, and Omer Neutra were among the approximately 1,200 people, mostly civilians, killed by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023, during the cross-border onslaught that started the ongoing war.

I am an Israeli peace scholar, who, like 70% of the Israeli public, wants the war in Gaza to end now with the return of the 59 hostages (live and dead).  I am also part of the 84% of the Israeli population, who are deeply concerned about the fate of the hostages and argue that “no victory” (over Hamas) can be reached without the return of all the hostages, now.”\nSeveral days ago, the Israeli security cabinet approved a plan to escalate the war, including the military occupation of most of the Gaza Strip, and the forceful displacement of 2 million Palestinians to a tiny area in its southern part.  That military plan, if implemented, will lead to the death of many Israeli hostages, Israeli soldiers, and hundreds and thousands of innocent Palestinian residents of Gaza, mostly women and children. That is a catastrophic plan that will bring more tragedy and misery to both peoples, and that has to be avoided now, by all means.\nThis week, President Donald Trump will be visiting your kingdom, alongside the UAE and Qatar. The US President is very interested in enhancing the economic, security, and technological cooperation between your two countries, including agreements in trillions of dollars, to the benefit of the USA and Saudi Arabia.  You have the leverage, the moral and pragmatic obligation, to condition any agreement with the United States in taking a joint initiative to stop the war and impose that initiative upon the recalcitrant Israeli government and Hamas.\nAs outlined in the Egyptian and the Arab League plans, Hamas has to surrender its political control in the Gaza Strip to a technocratic transitional government, with Palestinian legitimacy.  Furthermore, the Gaza Strip has to be demilitarized, and a massive international effort of reconstruction has to start after the war.  Eventually, the jumpstarting of a renewed peace process involving Israel and the PLO/Palestinian Authority should take place, since the only realistic and moral solution to the tragedy that involves Israelis and Palestinians would be to return to the logic of partitioning the Land between its two peoples in a two-state solution.  We are far from achieving that, but the urgent task is to end the war now, return the hostages, and dismantling Hamas from hijacking its own people in Gaza.\nA significant part of Israeli civil society has been demonstrating and acting against the government for the last year and a half, to bring an end to this horrible war, return the remaining hostages home, and end the misery to the Palestinians in Gaza.  But today we need your help, and you have the leverage to do that, now.  You should also be aware that the majority of Israelis dream of ‘normalization’ and peace with your country, within the framework of a ‘package deal’ that will include a security alliance against Iran, and separation from the Palestinians, including the eventual establishment of a demilitarized Palestinian State alongside Israel.  President Trump wants peace, no wars. And this is money time, in more than one sense, to save Israelis and Palestinians from their engulfing catastrophe. All the peoples in the Middle East and history will forever thank you for your intervention in ending the war in Gaza."}

A day hardly goes by when somewhere in either the print or digital media a newly introduced and innovative use for artificial intelligence (AI) is not claiming its place in the technology food chain. Medicine, energy, finance, education, and security are only some of the applications and industries that have adopted AI programs to complement if not entirely replace the involvement of human beings. And tech-oriented nations throughout the world – including, of course, the Start Up Nation, Israel – are competing to see who can go the farthest the fastest.\nAm I the only one concerned by all this and more than a little troubled that we very well may be, as Barry McGuire sang so long ago, on the Eve of Destruction?\nThroughout the last twenty or thirty years, we have been warned of the dangers to our bodies inherent in the ingestion of artificial ingredients, colors, flavors, and whatnot. Veganism is rapidly becoming the “in thing”, and health food stores and “green” supermarkets have for some time become commonplace among the more familiar food and grocery outlets. Yet, we are not in the least hesitant about entrusting our minds and souls – the creative, inventive, innovative, and empathetic abilities that define who we are – to algorithms and coding sequences. And making the matter even more absurd is that there are programs that have been developed for teachers, security officers, and professional investigators designed to detect the use of artificial intelligence. Artificial watchdogs, in other words, policing artificial intelligence.\nWhich is why I did not know whether to laugh or cry after reading an Israeli journalist’s recent admission that the upbringing he received and the personal manners he was taught from his parents has him say “Thank you” to the AI whiz ChatGPT for services and assistance that were rendered. Why an experienced journalist and talented writer would seek help from an inanimate conglomeration of hardware of software in and of itself makes little sense. Indeed, this is more than indicative of how, within a relatively short period of time, AI has become ingrained into our day-to-day lives.\nOf greater concern is that far and few between are to be found warnings about allowing AI to grow without technological constraints or legislated limitations. The benefits of the precision that AI is capable of achieving does not come without a steep cost. Indeed, when examined carefully and objectively, the conclusion that AI provides more disadvantages than advantages becomes unavoidable. If left to advance unfettered or unchecked, it is only a matter of time that AI will create a society that was once the exclusive domain of science fiction masters such as Isaac Asimov.\nWe cannot, in the first place, deny that civilization as we know it today is being inundated if not actually threatened by the extraordinarily rapid development of the enhanced capabilities of AI-infused robotics. Objective studies and analyses are reaching the conclusion that it won’t be too long before AI will enable the non-human performance of tasks in ways that far exceed human capability. The digitalized operation of vehicles, surgery and diagnostics, and creative-related processes such as writing, architecture, and music are most certainly on the agenda. That we have freed from the bottle a benevolent genie cannot be taken for granted. Those in the know – Bill Gates and Elon Musk, for example – have not been hesitant to express their concerns that it won’t be long before humanity loses control over AI-controlled processes and procedures, frighteningly pointing out that these systems are not always in synch with human safety and values.\nBut more importantly, perhaps, as AI becomes increasingly integrated into even the most mundane of activities, there will be a similarly increasing reduction in the need for human interaction. Unchecked, AI will, within a very short time, become regarded as something indispensable in both the white- and blue-collar workforce. It is, needless to say, in the commercial interest of those developing and marketing AI systems and processes to make human beings as reliant on these innovations as possible with little regard for the inevitable consequences. And make no mistake – even scant contact, communication and cooperation with family, friends, neighbors, colleagues, and, yes, even strangers are essential for both our physical and mental wellbeing.\nAnd what, it is fair to ask, is the Jewish perspective with regard to artificial intelligence. That it is slowly but steadily entering into the study halls of yeshivas is clear, as the ability to access with a click or two scant resources and literature and make ancient languages understandable are aids that cannot be overstated. What, though, will happen when AI demonstrates the ability to answer those questions that proverbially cross the rabbi’s eyes? What will replace the sensitivity that flesh-and-blood rabbis invariably must consider when approached with spiritual traumas and dilemmas? Will HaRav ChatGPT, I suspect, will come up empty.\nOur future, in other words, must not be decided by what is considered “sexy” or state-of-the-art. Corporations and governments must work together to prevent a chaotic reality that becomes both uncontrollable and untenable. An author, posting on a social media platform said it best: “I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.”\nOh, and just to set the record straight, the earlier mentioned journalist is not the only one who expresses appreciation to inanimate bytes, arguments, and arrays. Whenever Waze’s Voice Guidance System cheerfully informs me that “You have reached your destination” I inevitably mutter a whispered note of gratitude to Amy.\nWell, not actually to Amy. No, my thanks are addressed to the innovators and software engineers that provided me, someone with a poor sense of direction, an indispensable resource. Without Waze’s help I would probably still be searching for the Jerusalem wedding hall in which my daughter got married four months ago. And my friend who was sitting shiva in some off-the-beaten-track street in Ramat Gan would have received my words of comfort via a WhatsApp message.\nBut restraints are solely called for. ChatGPT, Waze, and all the other AI intrusions are slowly eroding the ecosystem that humans are part of. Sooner or later this will be result in harmful levels of unemployment, depression, and insecurity. All those who are unabashed cheerleaders for the ongoing enhancements to AI should take a step back and consider just what they are encouraging.\nNonetheless, dinosaurs like myself find old habits hard to break, so we’ll continue to say “please” and “thank you” as taught by our parents and teachers. Even to ChatGPT and Amy."}

Our patience for the release of these precious souls have worn thin and have now run its course. But, as a people, we will never ever give up hope until all the hostages are released and brought home.\n(Parenthetically, as I write this blog, we are Baruch HaShem informed that Israeli born American Idan Alexander has just been released by Hamas to the Red Cross and will then he will be transferred to IDF. It is now time to bring all hostages home.)\nWhile preparing for another invasion into Gaza, we tell ourselves that we are giving one more strong and mighty kick at the can, especially since our relationship with Washington is only as reliable and consistent as it is at this moment in history.\nAs we know, this relationship can and will change on the dime.\nWe should never forget that the “art of the deal” is more about the United States and its geopolitical status around the globe, including the Middle East, rather that protected Jewish lives or safeguarding Israel against existential threats to our precious homeland.\nYes, we are profoundly appreciative and thankful to the United States for its continued material and foreign policy support. But, history dictates that our Jewish people never succeeded or survived a crisis based on the support it received from others. To be sure, throughout Jewish history, at the end of the day, we always needed to go it alone and fend for ourselves; and always with the strong guiding hand of  HaShem.\nThe thought of engaging in yet another grinding, bloody and protracted ground offensive pierces our hearts and numbs our senses. The very thought of losing even one more precious member of the IDF turns our stomachs. Our hearts ache with unbearable pain and fear – irrespective of how prepared we are as a nation and as a formidable army.\nWe can’t even begin to imagine the unbearable pain, depression and feeling of helplessness that the families of our dear hostages are now experiencing – especially as we prepare for another military battle.\nThe State of Israel’s safety and security is currently at a critical crossroads. It is a defining moment in our history and one which will mold, shape and inform our future destiny.\nThe only reliable source of strength we can depend upon is ourselves and our faith in HaShem. No other people, country  or  government.\nAs we know Gideon was  primarily known as a man of faith. He was a judge, military leader; warrior and liberator of Israel over the evil Midianites. He is also remembered for his deep and profound  emunah and bitachon in HaShem.\nWhat more appropriate biblical personality do we identify than Gideon for this soon to be realized difficult and challenging military operation.\nAs we are poised to do battle once again, and hopefully for the last time against Hamas, let us hope and pray that Gideon’s Chariots, as the military campaign’s name implies, will lead and carry acheinu beit yisrael into battle with true success, hatzlacha and victory,\nWe pray with all of our hearts that our hostages will be safely and peacefully returned to our precious homeland – Eretz Yisroel.\nWe have no choice; we have no option.\nNow is the time\nHashem Imachem and Am Yisrael Chai"}

The war started on October 7, 2023, when the Palestinian terror group Hamas led an invasion of southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 251 abducted as hostages to Gaza.\nThere have been repeated calls from groups of reservists to not turn up for duty over the past two years, mostly as a protest against the government’s planned judicial overhaul, seen as undermining democracy, and against the renewed fighting in Gaza, which critics say is a political move that will endanger the lives of the remaining hostages.\nThere is also mounting discontent at the number of days reservists have being asked to serve since the start of the Gaza war, with some called up for hundreds of days. This has been exacerbated by government efforts to legislate an exemption for tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox youths from the draft.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nLast month, the IDF said it would take strong action against reservists who refuse to serve.\nIDF troops operate in the Gaza Strip, in a handout photo published on May 11, 2025. (Israel Defense Forces)\nYahalom is a master’s student at the Hebrew University. He was called up for 110 days of duty with his unit in the West Bank’s Jordan Valley, Kan said.\nAccording to the unsourced report, he declared that he would not serve in the “occupied West Bank or the ongoing war in Gaza.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe reportedly specified he would not “take part in IDF operations” in the West Bank. During the court-martial, he also said, “I see the current campaign in Gaza as clearly illegal” and declared that he has “a moral duty to refuse.”\nAccording to the Yesh Gvul activism group, which supports soldiers who object to Israel’s control of the West Bank, since the start of the Gaza war hundreds of reservists have refused to carry out their duties for ideological reasons.\nIshai Menuchin, spokesman for the group, told Kan that Yahalom’s incarceration was “a worsening of the attitude of the IDF and indicates growing pressure on the army due to the current wave of refusers.”\nAn IAF F-15 takes off to conduct strikes on Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip on October 15, 2023. (IDF)\nSix months ago, a reservist was court-martialed and given a two-week suspended sentence for refusing to serve. Then, in March, an Israeli Air Force reservist navigator was “permanently” dismissed from the military after he posted on social media that he would not show up for reserve duty.\nMost of those who have refused have just been sent home, Kan said.\nA recent wave of calls began in April with a group of roughly 1,000 Israeli Air Force veterans, the vast majority of whom are in retirement, who published a letter urging refusal to serve.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Air Force veterans were then joined by a group of some 150 ex-Navy officers and dozens of reservist doctors who signed their names to letters demanding an immediate end to the war for the sake of the remaining hostages. Former Mossad members, ex-IDF paratroopers, and graduates of an elite military program have also given their support.\nThe army recently issued tens of thousands of call-up orders for IDF reservists ahead of a planned major offensive in the Gaza Strip.\nAmid mass protests in 2023 against the government’s controversial judicial overhaul agenda, several groups of reservists, including some in the IAF, issued statements saying they would refuse to serve under a regime they no longer viewed as democratic.\nAt the height of the 2023 protests, hundreds of IDF reservists signed declarations saying they would no longer show up for reserve duty to protest the government advancing its plans to curtail the judiciary.\nHowever, when war erupted in Gaza on October 7, 2023, with the Hamas-led attacks and massacres, nearly 300,000 reservists showed up for duty, marking the largest-ever call-up of reservists in Israel’s history."}

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago / Getty Images via AFP)\nAlexander, a dual citizen who grew up in New Jersey, was serving in the IDF’s Golani Brigade at the time of his abduction. He was kidnapped from his base near the Gaza border community of Nirim, known as the White House post, during the October 7 onslaught.\nIn a statement, Hamas announced on Sunday its decision to release Alexander after recent talks with US officials and “intensified efforts to achieve a ceasefire, open border crossings, and allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the US informed it of Hamas’s intent to release Alexander “without compensation or conditions” and that the step is expected to lead to negotiations on a truce.\nNetanyahu’s government was angered by US direct talks with Hamas earlier this year that led to a Hamas offer to release Alexander and the bodies of four other hostages if Israel recommitted to a stalled ceasefire deal. Days later, however, Israel resumed the war.\nUS President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff told AP that Hamas’s goal in releasing Alexander was to restart talks on a ceasefire, the release of additional hostages and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza before Israel carries out a threatened total takeover of the territory.\nIndirect talks between Hamas and the US began five days ago, an Egyptian official and a senior Hamas official told AP, with both describing the release of Alexander as a goodwill gesture.\nAlexander will be the first male hostage soldier abducted by Hamas on October 7, 2023, to be returned to Israel by the terror group.\nOn October 7, Hamas took 19 male soldiers hostage — not all of them on duty — and seven female surveillance soldiers, the latter of whom have all since been returned to Israel (five in a deal with Hamas, one rescued alive, and the body of one recovered by troops.)\nCurrently, Hamas is holding 14 male Israeli soldiers hostage, eight of whom have been declared dead, among them the body of Lt. Hadar Goldin, who was killed in 2014.\nThe apparent pause comes as Israel has been pushing ahead with its military operations in Gaza.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Israeli Air Force struck over 50 targets in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, the military said, including cells of terror operatives and buildings used by terror groups to plan and carry out attacks.\nAdditionally, the IDF said ground forces targeted a Hamas command center, caches of weapons, and sniper positions.\nHamas authorities reported 19 killed and dozens wounded during the previous 24 hours. The toll could not immediately be verified and did not differentiate between civilians and gunmen."}

The terrorists attempted to use the civilians as pawns to negotiate with Israeli security forces, aiming to take the hostages to Gaza and secure themselves safe passage.\nSurvivors said the terrorists positioned the hostages between themselves and the IDF soldiers, and after hours holed up inside, the IDF fired tank shells at the building and soldiers advanced toward the terrorists who were barricaded inside. Only one of the hostages emerged alive (another had exited earlier while being used as a human shield). In an in-depth probe published months later, the IDF said that many of the hostages were apparently killed by gunfire.\nFor 11 days after the attack the Haker family did not know of Ze’ev and Zehava’s fate, until their bodies were finally identified.\nThey were buried in Kibbutz Kvutzat Shiller on October 19. The couple are survived by their three children, Limor, Dvir and Hagay, and 11 grandchildren.\nZehava was born in Givatayim and came by herself to the kibbutz at age 9 in the 1960s, while Ze’ev was born in Gan Yoshiya and later moved with his family to Tkuma in the south, according to a kibbutz eulogy.\nThe couple met while they were both working on Kibbutz Na’aran in the Jordan Valley, and fell rapidly in love, marrying not long after in 1978 and settling down in Be’eri, where their three children were born. Zehava worked in many jobs on the kibbutz, including at the printing house and in education. Ze’ev spent years as the kibbutz’s head of agriculture, where he helped grow potatoes, wheat, peanuts, corn, peas and gladioli until his retirement at age 70.\nZehava’s friend, Naomi Ilan, wrote online about how, “from a difficult and lonely childhood, you built yourself with your own two hands. Your strengths as a person, as a woman, always inspired endless admiration in me.”\n“You built a good and supportive relationship with Ze’ev and you later taught yourself to be a mom, your children blossomed and were blessed with a loving, warm and supportive family. Later of course you were also a wonderful grandmother to your grandchildren. You were an optimistic, cheerful woman, who radiated kindness to those around you.”\nIn a eulogy written by Be’eri’s agricultural branch, Ze’ev was remembered for his decades of working “with endless professionalism” in the wheat fields and later with potatoes.\n“You became a professional, an autodidact” whose studies included a trip to Australia to learn new techniques. “You always loved the quiet work out in the field, you didn’t speak much, a quiet and modest man, a dedicated family man who loved his children, Zehava and his grandchildren.”\nTheir son, Hagay, wrote on Facebook in April about the “first wheat season without Dad.”\n“In a past life, in this season, Dad would already be running around the field after every harvester and combine, checking and making sure not a single grain was left in the field,” he wrote. “This is the first season that you weren’t by my side, from preparing the fields to sowing until the harvest… Sadly this year we sowed with tears and sadness and we also harvested with tears and sadness.”\n“Everyone who knew you couldn’t help but shed a tear in the field, but you should know that we still sowed and harvested,” he added. “Mom and Dad, I hope you can see the harvested wheat fields from above.

He is survived by his parents, Genya and Klimenty, and his two brothers, Shimon and Gai.\nBorn and raised in Ramle, Arie was the middle of his two brothers, attending schools in the city. His original name was Arik, but at a young age he decided it was not dignified enough, and changed it to Arie, according to a state eulogy.\nArie had an entrepreneurial spirit from a very young age, his loved ones said, even starting to work at a supermarket at age 11 to save up money and become financially independent — pursuing his dream of becoming a millionaire.\nAfter completing a financial advisor’s course, he worked advising and coaching others with their money, and on social media was active in sharing financial advice online. He also had taken courses in NLP and theta-healing and considered himself spiritually connected, with a desire to pass that onto others. On his leg he tattooed the word “Creator,” which was later engraved on his headstone.\nIn 2021, Arie was interviewed for a Ynet article about young adults who had returned to living with their parents during COVID: “It’s an emotional experience to suddenly come back. I lived in Tel Aviv for a year and I came home to Mom,” he said. “There aren’t any pubs or nightlife, so at least I have Mom’s food.”\nHe was very close to his nephews, Itamar and Ofri, and dreamed of one day becoming a father himself, his loved ones said. He was also very devoted to his dog, Mika, and took her with him almost everywhere, including trips overseas. Before settling in Tel Aviv in the months just before he was killed, Arie spent a long stretch overseas, visiting India, Mexico, the Caribbean and Europe.\nMarking 30 days since he was killed, his sister-in-law, Rinat, wrote on Facebook that Arie was “a beloved boy, smiling and sweet who became a beloved man, always doing things for others, with hands of gold and a pure heart.”\nRinat wrote that she is always thinking “of your constant smile and the good energy you would bring with you everywhere and in every situation… I would always wait for you to arrive at any event or family meal, to bring with you good vibes, interesting conversations and 200% attention and pure fun for my kids. Now there is an empty hole that nobody can fill at every family gathering… we’ll never be the same family again.”\nIn a memorial video produced by the Ramle municipality, Arie’s mother, Genya, described how he surprised her by coming home early from India: “He called me and said, ‘Mom, what are you doing, I’m in India, planning on coming back in two weeks’ and then he suddenly rang the doorbell.”\n“The joy he had when he saw me and the joy I had to see him — that’s what I think about all the time,” she said. “He was a guy who loved life… he was a happy guy, he was super optimistic, he wanted kids and a family.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

Ron Sherman, 19, a COGAT soldier, from Lehavim, was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7 from his army base next to the Erez Crossing. He died in captivity and his body was brought back to Israel in December 2023.\nRon’s family said the morning of the attack he was on the phone with his mother before they got cut off, and he switched to sending WhatsApp messages. At 7:12 a.m., Ron wrote: “That’s it, Mom, they’re here, it’s over, I love you.”\nBut hours later the family came across Hamas videos showing him bound in the back of a pickup truck after being kidnapped. Ron’s comrades, Staff Sgt. Or Malka, Sgt. Emil Samoylov and Cpl. Lidor Mekayes were killed on the base on October 7, while Ron, Cpl. Nik Beizer and Sgt. Tamir Nimrodi were taken hostage alive.\nOn December 14, 2023, IDF troops recovered Ron’s body from a tunnel in northern Gaza along with those of Nik and Elia Toledano. Tamir is believed to still be held hostage.\nAn IDF investigation published in September 2024 revealed that Ron, Elia and Nik were killed on November 10, 2023, as a result of a “byproduct” of an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip, likely indicating that they suffocated or were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning inside a tunnel. Ron’s family said he had asthma and needed an inhaler.\nRon was buried on December 15, 2023, in Lehavim. He is survived by his parents, Maayan and Alexander and his siblings Dan and Eden.\nBorn in Petah Tikva, Ron grew up in Lehavim, a small town north of Beersheba. He attended high school in the nearby Eshel HaNasi youth village.\nThe oldest child of two veterinarians, Ron was a major animal lover, and was raised in a house full of pets, including many dogs and cats. His family said he was a huge soccer fan and loved to travel around the world, and was extremely competitive and very charismatic.\nHe enlisted in the IDF in December 2022, just 10 months before he was kidnapped. Due to his asthma, he was not able to serve in a full combat role.\n“You gave us 19 years of pride and happiness,” his father, Alex, said at his funeral. “We saw you emerge into the world and from your very first moment you filled your surroundings with light. You grew up from a dreaming and sensitive child into an impressive young man, smart with a captivating smile and always surrounded by friends.”\nAlex said that Ron “succeeded in everything you set your mind to and you had dreams that you undoubtedly would have achieved, if your life had not been cut short in such a tragic and horrible manner.”\nAmid the family’s pain, he said, “we will try to remember you with the smile and the mischievous and confident expression that so characterized you. You came back to us Ron, it’s over. You’re home. In our hearts.”\nHis younger brother, Dan, wrote on an Instagram memorial page that the world is “a cruel place that doesn’t allow pure and good people like you the opportunity to grow, to accomplish their dreams, to build a family.”\nDan said Ron was “an incredible person, loved by so many friends, smart, opinionated and funny. I can’t imagine my life without you, and the fact that you can’t continue your life, because I know it would have been incredible.”\nHe said that just a few days before Ron was kidnapped, “you played with me on the new PlayStation and I felt that we had gone back to playing like when we were kids. I missed it so much, I wanted us to play together again.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

Following the outrage, local religious authorities said they would lower the fence between the sections and cover it with vegetation.\nPlahti is survived by her parents, Olga and Roman and brother Ilya; Eliyahu is survived by his parents, Ori and Liat and sister Avia.\nPlahti’s mother, Olga, said Alina used to “light [Shabbat] candles and separate challah… I want to tell you that she was murdered because she was Jewish.”\nOlga said she spoke to her daughter after the rockets started firing, and she told her she was running to escape from the terrorists. She called her again 15 minutes later, “and she said ‘Mommy, I can’t talk right now, I’ll call you later, I love you.'” That was the last she heard from her. “We waited three weeks, we searched for her. Alina was very strong, until the last moment we didn’t believe we would get such news.”\nFriends and family of Eliyahu said he loved photography and brought his new camera to Supernova to document the event. He loved nature and music festivals, and enjoyed working out and keeping a healthy lifestyle, they recalled. His mother said he had a “joyful energy and a pure heart.”\nPlahti’s friend, Tohar Hen, described her on Instagram as “my pure and beautiful angel… everyone could sense your presence, your nobility, your optimism, your energy, just by sitting next to you.”\nHagit Asulin, a friend of the couple, wrote on social media that they met at a party like the Supernova, and since then were inseparable: “He said that Alina would be his wife, he had found the love of his life.”\nAsulin wrote that Plahti “overcame depression and anxiety, and she dreamed of becoming a mentor.

She had bright and smart eyes, a management approach of partnership, a humanity that was not afraid of assertiveness and above all a wisdom and a deep and well-rounded perception of life.”\nHer friend Yael Weis described Mati as “fire and ice, energetic, purposeful, ambitious, full of life, embracing and warm — the phrase which most defines her in my eyes is ‘the head of the tribe.’ She had the ability to connect people and to cause them to feel connected and a sense of belonging.

He wasn’t satisfied with polite friendships, he would ask how people were getting by financially, how their relationships were really going, their communication, how things were with the kids,” she said. “He always believed that everyone around him could achieve anything and infected them with that belief.”\nClil said that her husband “always told his friends yes. No matter if it was going out for a beer or helping move apartments.

Yuval Yoffe, 21, a platoon commander in the 7th Armored Brigade, from Tzofit, was killed on October 11, 2023, in fighting near Kibbutz Kissufim.\nYuval was at home on break with the start of the Hamas onslaught on October 7, and was called back to base at the Shizafon training camp in the south. Yuval and his comrades took part in the battle against the Hamas invaders for several days along the border and in hard-hit communities.\nHe last spoke with his parents on Tuesday evening, and expressed satisfaction that he had been able to be a part of the operations to defend against the Hamas attack. The next morning, four days after the start of the attack, Yuval was killed next to Kibbutz Kissufim.\nHe was buried in Tzofit on October 13. He is survived by his parents, Yoram and Ossi, and his older siblings Shahar and Omri.\nBorn and raised in Tzofit, a small community near Kfar Saba, Yuval was the youngest in the family. From a young age he loved music and soccer, and was a devout fan of the Hapoel Kfar Saba and Liverpool soccer teams, according to an IDF eulogy. He also played the sport for many years, until a knee injury at age 17.\nYuval attended the Tavor pre-military academy in the Galilee while he sought to heal from the injury and find the right IDF path forward. In December 2021 he enlisted in the IDF and joined the Armored Brigade, later training as a tank commander, completing officer’s training and eventually being appointed a platoon commander a few months before his death.\nHis family said Yuval loved his country and exploring its environs, spending time at fresh springs, hiking around with his guitar and his campstove for coffee. Giving back to the state was deeply important to him, and he viewed his military service with great meaning.\n“We always said to him, ‘What, you’re going to be an officer now?’ All your friends will be released and send you pictures from Thailand,'” Yuval’s brother, Shahar, told Ynet. “He always had a saying along the way — ‘Those who can, must.’ I really think it’s one of the things that best characterized him.”\nShahar added, “When we talk about Yuval, we talk about his smile, which was impossible not to fall in love with in a second. It’s a smile that really epitomized him. He was always smiling, no matter what.”\nSomething else that encapsulated Yuval was “the light that he spread everywhere, and the feeling that he gave to everyone he encountered that he was the most important person on the planet at that moment in time,” his brother added.\nAt the ceremony marking his headstone unveiling, Yuval’s mother, Ossi, said that they had “been privileged to be your parents, a wonderful kid like you, a man, mature and so moral who entered directly into everyone’s hearts.”\n“It’s not fair or logical in any way that our time with you was so short and limited. You’ll remain a part of us forever, and we will fulfill your father’s wish that as many people as possible will know who you are and will learn the legacy that you managed to leave behind in your short life,” she continued.\n“We will keep up the customs you loved, Dad goes to synagogue on Friday nights, we make kiddush but not as good as you, though we’re trying — we’ll memorialize you in every possible way. You’re in our hearts forever.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

They were the first ever Iron Dome battery operators to be killed in battle.\nNativ is survived by his parents, Esther and Hagai, and his older siblings Nofar and Kfir. He was buried on October 12 on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.\nHis family said he dreamed of an army career, and was always the first to help others, loved to cook — including for his comrades on base — and was smiling in every photo.\nHis brother, Kfir Kuzaro, told Channel 13 news that at around 8:10 a.m. Nativ sent them a selfie of himself in a flak jacket, writing, “Wow, what a morning I had, all the rockets were by me.

That way I won’t be forgotten.'”\nKfir told a local news outlet that Nativ wanted to undergo officer training and stay on in the army past his mandatory service. “He set it as a goal and spoke about it with us. He had aspirations to study, he loved to learn. He was a wonderful little brother who told me that he wanted to follow in my footsteps. He was the light of the house.”\nNativ’s father, Hagai told the site, “In every photo you could see his smile and his light, even when he died he was smiling. A boy who was so loved by everyone. He was even in the family WhatsApp groups of his friends.”\nHagai said Nativ “was always doing and volunteering, at school, he was the first to volunteer, and also at home, always the first to help. Also on base, he would always treat everyone — he told us all the time how much he loved us and loved home. Nativ was so unique, a special boy with a special name.”\nNofar said that his status on WhatsApp for years has turned into a last will and testament for his family and friends, reading: “Leave the next generations with a better world than the one we found.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

Speaking to the Argentine press, Fishman recalled Yasmin’s WhatsApp message on the morning of the attack, revealing the family was hiding in a bunker as “five terrorists” invaded the kibbutz.

Elior Ifrah, 34, a police detective in the Negev district, from Ofakim, was killed while battling the Hamas attack on the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nElior was working as a police officer helping to secure the festival that morning. With the start of the rocket attacks, he called his wife at home and told her that things were crazy and he was trying to help everyone leave. Shortly afterward, he called to warn her of the terrorist invasion, telling her to lock the doors and close the shutters at home in Ofakim.\nAt the site of the rave, Elior worked to help partygoers flee and hide, protecting them with his body until his very last bullets. He was shot and killed while calling on others to flee, alongside his friend and colleague First Sgt. Sharon Rahmani.\nHe was buried in Beersheba on October 10. He is survived by his wife, Hen, their three children, Lavi, 7, Harel, 5, and Ilay, who was born 7 months after his father was killed. Elior is also survived by his parents, Rita and Zion, and his brothers Shlomi and Avihai.\nBorn and raised in Beersheba, Elior was always good with his hands, including focusing on art during school, always being handy around the house and later even helping to build his own home. He completed his IDF service in the Border Police, staying on past the mandatory period and moving to serve in the Gaza Division, according to an Ofakim municipal eulogy.\nIn 2015, Elior enlisted in the Israel Police, serving as a detective in the Negev District’s investigative and intelligence unit. Loved ones described him as dedicated to the job, always aspiring to learn and develop further in the role and bring new ideas and technological advances to the unit.\nHe was a doting father to Lavi and Harel, and he was thrilled about the newest baby on the way — which the couple had only found out about not long before Elior was killed.\nHis father-in-law, Vili, wrote on Instagram to “Elior, my beloved son-in-law with the permanent smile and kind heart. You always helped me, always volunteered to assist others in everything. You knew it all. I will miss you so much. I promise to watch over my Hen and the sweet grandchildren you left us.”\nHis wife, Hen, told a local news site that Elior “always said that nothing was impossible. You want it? Work for it. When he took a project upon himself he would always carry it out in the best way, he was a perfectionist with hands of gold, he researched and learned out of curiosity and ambition to be the best. The salt of the earth.”\nIn their own home in Ofakim, which they moved to five years before Elior was killed, he played a role from start to finish, she said, “the plaster to the a/c units, the pergola, carpentry and the closets. We dreamed together and we got to achieve those dreams… Elior always said that anyone can achieve the dreams in their heart with their own hands.”\n“He had such high levels of generosity, he always helped others with patience and calm,” she added, “with a smile on his face and crazy charisma that bowled people over.

That everyone will be connected to what came before and what came after. It was very important to Hallel,” she said.\n“Hallel, in his own way, all of the time, until the end, always was perfect, always with emotion, always with dedication, to take upon himself a huge task — he protected the people, he protected the land,” Chana continued. “We remember him and we are proud of him.

He stressed that Germany understands the dilemma of Hamas embedding in the civilian population and stealing aid that enters the Strip; nevertheless, “the suffering of Gaza’s civilian population” deeply concerns both Germany and Israel’s other friends.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe also noted that the aid agency UNRWA, which Israel has accused of being entangled with Hamas, “is not a worthy partner, so we have to find alternatives” for the distribution of aid.\nIn his own response, Herzog called on the international community to take part in a new aid mechanism to “enable the distribution of aid directly to the people of Gaza,” referring to a newly unveiled US-backed aid plan to circumvent Hamas.\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier (right) shakes hands with President Isaac Herzog during a joint press conference following talks at the Bellevue Palace, May 12, 2025, in Berlin, Germany. (John MACDOUGALL/AFP)\nSteinmeier said the establishment of relations with Israel in 1965 was “a gift that we Germans could not have expected after the horrors of the Second World War,” while Herzog said the countries’ reconciliation and close relations was “a source of hope.”\nThe German president suggested that Israel needs to seize the opportunities in front of it in order to forge new partnerships with unlikely future allies.\n“Germany stands ready to engage with Israel’s neighbors and support dialogue toward a serious political solution,” he said, referring to recent trips to “Cairo, Amman, Qatar and especially Riyadh” as highlighting a “window of opportunity” for Israel, with regard to possible normalization with Saudi Arabia.\n“I am concerned that this openness might be lost and that the window of opportunity might soon close,” added Steinmeier. “Therefore, I urge us all to seize the opportunity that still exists, together with other countries, and to work toward a political solution for the sake of the future.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nHerzog, who has long expressed his support for wider peace efforts, declared that “there is nothing I want more than to shake the hands of Sheikh Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, as a rapprochement of Jew and Muslim in the region.”\nOn Monday evening, Herzog was hosted at a state dinner by Steinmeier, and earlier in the day he also met with the president of the Bundestag parliament, spent time with a local youth group, and visited a memorial at the Platform 17 train station from where thousands of Berlin Jews were deported to their deaths during the Holocaust.\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier (2L), his wife Elke Buedenbender (R), President Isaac Herzog (L), and his wife Michal Herzog light candles during a commemoration ceremony at the Platform 17 Memorial at Grunewald train station in Berlin, on May 12, 2025.

Israel was only officially updated on Sunday, when it was a fait accompli.\nFor the families of hostages without American or other second citizenship, delight in the return of another hostage was tempered by the heightened concern that their own government is less obsessed than the leader of the free world with liberating their loved ones from the daily life-threatening peril of Hamas captivity.\n“My Matan, a citizen who is unwell and who was abducted from his bed, is being held together with Edan Alexander,” Einav Zangauker, the most relentless public critic of the prime minister among the parents of hostages, posted on social media on Monday morning. “The two of them are in one dark tunnel, without other hostages. If Matan is left behind alone in the tunnel, Netanyahu has decided to murder my son,” she charged. “Instead of freeing all the hostages, he is becoming my private angel of death.”\nBut while the release of the New Jersey-raised 21-year-old was plainly an instance of American First, the US president and his officials indicated that it is not a case of American Only.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nTrump pledged late on Sunday to seek the return of “all living hostages and remains to their loved ones.” His hostage envoy, Adam Boehler, flying to Israel together with Edan’s mother Yael on Monday, took to their plane’s PA to vouchsafe that Trump “told me to go get back every hostage, every Israeli,” and “he wasn’t kidding.”\nReleased hostage Edan Alexander, center, reunites with his parents at an IDF base near Re’im, May 12, 2025. (Israel Defense Forces)\nHaving ignored Netanyahu in securing Alexander’s release, the US president also appears increasingly at odds with the prime minister over the cabinet-approved imminent intense escalation of the fighting in Gaza, and the coalition’s determination not to end the war.\nHis special envoy Steve Witkoff was quoted recently telling families of hostages that the US did not see where further progress could be made militarily, and that it “wants to return the hostages, but Israel is not ready to end the war.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhatever the veracity of that report, Trump stressed on Sunday that he regards Alexander’s release as “hopefully… the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict,” and he did not cite the imperative to destroy Hamas as a condition for the war to end.\nUS Ambassador Mike Huckabee, similarly celebrating Alexander’s release, also said on Monday evening that he hoped it “marks the beginning of the end to this terrible war.” While Huckabee stressed that “Hamas alone is responsible for the continued death and suffering,” he, too, did not specify that Hamas would have to be destroyed for the fighting to conclude.\nAt the joint press conference with Netanyahu in February where Trump announced his radical idea of turning Gaza into a ” Riviera of the Middle East,” the president did state that he had discussed with Netanyahu “how we can work together to ensure Hamas is eliminated.”\nBut since then, Netanyahu elected not to proceed to the second and third phases of the hostage-ceasefire deal that Witkoff finalized in Doha in January, and last week set out his plans for “an intensified operation in Gaza” that, he made clear, would not end anytime soon.\nAnd while the prime minister spoke of retaining captured territory until all the declared goals of the war were attained, a stance not entirely contradicting Trump’s Gaza vision, his far-right coalition partner, Bezalel Smotrich, went considerably further. Smotrich declared that Israel was “finally going to occupy the Gaza Strip” and asserted that once the new offensive began, there would be “no retreat from the territories we have conquered, not even in exchange for hostages.”\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) in a video with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich after passing the 2025 state budget, March 25, 2025. (Screenshot/GPO)\nGiven that Smotrich, along with fellow far-right coalition party leader Itamar Ben Gvir, had insisted on a return to the war, rather than continuing to the second phase of the January ceasefire deal, Trump and his officials might reasonably have concluded that it is Smotrich, rather than Netanyahu, who is determining Israeli government policy — and it is evidently not to their liking.\nADVERTISEMENT\nVance’s warning\nIn October, at the height of the US presidential election campaign, Trump’s running mate, now Vice President JD Vance, warned resonantly that “America’s interest is sometimes going to be distinct” from Israel’s. He was speaking not in the context of Gaza, but of Iran: “Sometimes we’re going to have overlapping interests, and sometimes we’re going to have distinct interests,” Vance repeated. “And our interest very much is in not going to war with Iran.”\nUS President Donald Trump (center) and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu look to Vice President JD Vance in the Oval Office of the White House, February 4, 2025, in Washington. (AP/Evan Vucci)\nFor all the protestations from both sides that ties between the two leaderships are “excellent,” daylight is visible as regards the prosecution of the war against Hamas, especially given Smotrich’s declared annexationist and resettlement ambitions. In addition, there was acute discomfort over Trump reaching a truce deal with the Houthis, without warning Israel, a fairly staggering two days after a missile launched by the Yemeni terrorists had hit the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport, sending most foreign airlines fleeing, yet to return. And Trump has declared definitively that a deal with Iran “is going to happen” — echoing Vance’s October mindset and despite Netanyahu’s concern over the terms.\nThere’s also Trump’s repeated praise and support for Turkey’s Israel-loathing, Hamas-backing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. And we’ll see starting Tuesday how the president will choose to advance US-Saudi ties, including Riyadh’s desire for a civilian nuclear program opposed by Israel, amid the receding prospect of a Saudi-Israel normalization deal. This was an accord that Trump was once confident of brokering, and that Netanyahu, in a September 2023 address to the UN General Assembly, enthused would usher in a new Middle East. Two weeks later, Hamas invaded, and Netanyahu’s refusal to endorse any potential path to a Palestinian state, as demanded by the Saudis, has only intensified.\nThe extraction of Edan Alexander from the vicious clutches of Hamas emphatically serves both American and Israeli interests. But as Vance predicted, those interests are not always going to overlap. They already evidently don’t entirely align over Gaza, or the Houthis, or, most worryingly, over Iran — not for a US president impatiently intent on ending wars, dealing with an Israeli government, dominated by far-right expansionists, that isn’t."}

It’s not particularly strong, fast, or armed with sharp claws. Yet, it survives. The opossum has developed one of the most unusual defense mechanisms known in nature: when threatened by a large animal, it plays dead. It collapses, foams at the mouth, and releases an odor of decay, making it appear lifeless to its predator. Once the threat is gone, the opossum gets up, as if claiming victory, and continues with its life.\nThis peculiar behavior often brings to mind the political and strategic posturing of certain groups when faced with defeat. In May 2021, Israel launched Operation Guardian of the Walls, responding to the barrage of rockets fired by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) from Gaza towards Israeli cities, including Jerusalem. Over the next 11 days, the Israeli Air Force carried out extensive airstrikes targeting Hamas infrastructure, including rocket-launching sites, command centers, and weapon depots. Despite the extensive damage inflicted on Gaza, including the destruction of key Hamas military infrastructure, Yahya Sinwar, then leader of Hamas in Gaza, emerged (metaphorically from the rubble) sitting in an armchair with a smile on his face amidst the destruction of his own home and claimed victory. This was not a victory, but a performance, meant to maintain morale among Hamas supporters. \nSinwar’s narrative was carefully constructed, much like the opossum’s play-dead strategy. This illusion of strength through a narrative of manipulation is not limited to Hamas. It extends to other political entities, as evidenced by Pakistan’s response after having a major setback post the recent escalation with India. After the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, which killed 26 Indian tourists, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, 2025, a precision strike targeting nine terrorist bases across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir: Markaz Taiba Camp, Markaz Subhan Camp, Mehmoona Joya Camp, Gulpur Camp, Sarjal Camp, Abbas Camp, Syedna Belal Camp, Sawai Nala Camp, and Barnala Camp. The sites were linked to groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba. Over 100 terrorists were reportedly killed, including 10 family members of Masood Azhar, the UN-designated terrorist and leader of Jaish-e-Mohammed, and significant terrorist infrastructure was dismantled. What followed was a spectacle where the terrorists were given a state-like funeral, with the Pakistani military personnel in the background and Pakistani flags draped over their coffins. Notably, US-designated terrorist Hafiz Abdur Rauf led the funeral prayers in the ceremony.\nHafiz Abdur Rauf, a commander in Lashkar-e-Taiba and a US-designated global terrorist, led funeral prayers attended by Pakistan Army personnel, police, and other officials.\nPakistan, in response to the strike, began firing heavy artillery across the Line of Control (LoC), leading to the deaths of 15 civilians. It also launched drone attacks, targeting both military sites and civilian areas across major towns in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Gujarat. Over three consecutive days, it fired hundreds of Turkish-made drones and missiles (some Chinese-made PL-15 long-range air-to-air missiles) at Indian air bases. Most of the drones and missiles were intercepted by India’s robust air defense system.\nIndia’s response was careful and measured, focusing on military targets while avoiding civilian casualties and further escalation. India struck military bases and Pakistan’s air defense systems. Within three hours, 11 major military bases were struck, including Nur Khan (Chaklala), Rafiqui, Murid, Sukkur, Sialkot, Pasrur, Chunian, Sargodha, Skardu, Bholari, and Jacobabad, sending a clear message about India’s defensive capabilities and exposing the weakness of Pakistan’s air defense. Despite Pakistan’s claims of shooting down Indian jets and firing missiles at military targets, it has yet to provide any credible evidence of damage, and India has not acknowledged these claims either. The situation quickly descended into a battle of misinformation, with both sides using social media and fake news to present a false narrative of events. Videos from past conflicts, including the Israel-Gaza war, were recycled to mislead the public and bolster false claims.\nSatellite image showing damage to Pakistan’s Nur Khan air base following Indian airstrike. (Courtesy: Damien Symon)\nDespite suffering significant losses and the Indian Air Force targeting military assets in every major Pakistani city: Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Lahore, Sialkot, Sargodha, and Karachi—Pakistan’s government was quick to present its response as a victory. After the US-mediated pause between India and Pakistan on May 10, the Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared that Pakistan had emerged victorious, claiming that “Pakistanis are a self-reliant nation” and that any attack on their sovereignty would lead to a defensive response of unparalleled strength. However, Pakistan’s narrative was not about acknowledging the military failure; it was about creating the illusion of a victory in spite of the fact that the Pakistani Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) was the first to contact his Indian counterpart for a ceasefire. Sharif’s public address echoed the rhetoric of victory and strength that Sinwar had used, despite the undeniable losses Pakistan had suffered. The Indian army reported the loss of 5 Indian soldiers, while it is estimated that 35 to 40 Pakistani military personnel lost their lives in artillery and small arms fire along the LoC between May 7 and May 10. The Pakistani army continued to violate the ceasefire on May 10 as firing across the LoC continued and drones swarmed over Indian cities. The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing the nation on May 12, made it clear that any future terror attack from Pakistan would cross a red line, and India would take decisive action in response.\nApart from the deception using fake narratives, there are several troubling similarities between the  tactics and strategies of Hamas and the Pakistani army. First, there is the undeniable parallel in how both groups utilize civilians as shields. Hamas, throughout its operations, has habitually launched rockets from densely populated civilian areas, ensuring that any Israeli retaliation would result in civilian casualties, making it harder for Israel to respond without international condemnation. Similarly, during the recent escalation with India, the Pakistani military used the same tactic by launching drones, keeping civilian airspace open, and allowing civilian flights to continue. This made it incredibly challenging for Indian forces to effectively counter the attack without risking civilian lives. \nThe second observation is the intentional targeting of civilian areas by both Hamas and the Pakistani military. Just as Hamas has deliberately attacked civilian spaces in Israel, Pakistan’s military has employed similar tactics, particularly through the use of drones to target densely populated civilian zones. For instance, in Ferozepur, Punjab (India), a drone strike resulted in significant damage to a residential home and left three family members injured, highlighting the indiscriminate nature of such attacks. \nThe final observation is that the ideological opposition that runs through both Hamas and the Pakistani state is a key driver in shaping their actions against their adversaries. Hamas, as outlined in its 1988 charter, has made it clear that its war against Israel will persist until the state is eliminated—a deeply entrenched and extreme view that mirrors the founding principles of Pakistan. The creation of Pakistan was based on the idea of the two-nation theory, which posited that Muslims were fundamentally different from Hindus (in India) and therefore needed a separate homeland. This ideology formed the very foundation of Pakistan’s existence, and the issue of Kashmir has always been a mere side-effect of this broader conflict. It is an issue that will persist, even if a resolution is found to Kashmir’s status. In fact, as the current Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Ahmed Sharif Chaudhary revealed in a press conference about their army’s ideology “Islam is not only a part of our personal beliefs but also a part of our training, faith, and ethos. Iman, Taqwa, Jihad fi-Sabilillah—this is what drives us, this is our motto.” As long as this ideology persists and the Pakistani army continues to act as the protector of this ideological boundary, efforts to dismantle terrorist infrastructure will remain only a temporary solution.\nUltimately, like the opossum’s deceptive act of playing dead, these regimes rely on the illusion of victory and strength to survive politically. However, the truth has a way of emerging gradually, despite their best efforts to hide it. In an era defined by technology, internet connectivity, and the rapid spread of information, satellite images, videos from ordinary citizens, and independent journalism will gradually expose the truth and bring it into the public domain. As this information becomes more accessible, these carefully crafted narratives will lose their grip and the truth will become unavoidable."}

I had good days, excellent days and not so good days, pretty much like most of my colleagues. I also had plenty of time to observe my colleagues in action at meetings, social occasions and as my neighbors. What has always surprised me is the posturing and the degree of smugness present especially among some older professors and administrators around the country. I do attribute this to being aware of their superiority as highly educated members of society. They feel entitled to exert power over their less imposing colleagues, students and staff for their own good, not to mention rest of the population. Many younger faculty are waiting for get tenure so they can come out from the forest to do the same thing to their colleagues on the bottom of the academic ladder. And they may have the same or even more paternalistic attitude toward general audience.\nAnd why am I writing this? Because following the battles of presidents of our most prestigious universities first with Congress and now with president Trump how to deal with antisemitic and anti-Israel speech, acts and just pure vandalism and hooliganism by pro-Palestinian and pro-Hamas activists I (and I think many other people) came to the conclusion that these universities and their presidents missed the point. The lack of self-awareness together with the high level of self-confidence of certain university presidents’ is glaring and disconcerting. Do they not sense how conceited they appear?\nThis current battle is not about free speech, by which I mean peaceful free speech, and debates; something not really seen on many campuses anymore. It is not that much about autonomy of universities and freedom to hire whoever they want as faculty and make decision what type of students to admit as the fight is really about preserving and defending civil rights of minorities on campus, in this case Jewish students. Other issues have come up as well – safety of staff, both janitorial and public safety officers who got attacked by protesters and the vandalism which if committed by “regular” vandals and criminals would not be tolerated. Yes, universities are autonomous but only to certain degree. They do have to comply with many regulations regarding budgets, grant administration, conduct of faculty, staff and students including civil behavior and non-discrimination.\nAs far as instruction and education goes the goal at Harvard is in their own words: …”world-class faculty and talented students come together to pursue knowledge, conduct ground-breaking research, and produce transformative scholarly work to help to create a better world.” You decide for yourself how celebration of October 7 massacre by some professors and calls for destruction of Israel by pro-Hamas supporters contribute to a better world.\nThe current Harvard homepage brings information about many research projects cancelled or on hold because of withdrawal of federal funds. They do mention that halt in funding hurts safety of patients, but nothing about violent protests hurting safety of certain minority.\nIt is hard to believe that highly educated and intelligent people in highest positions at top universities would not understand what this stand-off is all about. Is it pride that makes Harvard president Alan Garber announce that he is standing up to Trump to preserve some most important principles, such as free speech and autonomy of Harvard, but he is not able to acknowledge danger of antisemitism and hooliganism to free thought and basic safety? Do violent protests create an atmosphere promoting creation of knowledge and transformative work? What is it Dr. Garber and other university presidents do not understand? Or are they, pardon me the expression, so much full of themselves that they and the institutions of which they are the “Supreme leaders” cannot admit that they failed their constituents, students, faculty, alumni and donors? Would president Garber rather forgo federal money and engage in costly lawsuits? Is the freedom to admit students who are likely to engage in similar protests and the hiring of intolerant and strongly anti-Israel (and antisemitic) faculty worth the fight? Is this how he plans to support medical research at Harvard? Does a report on antisemitism have to be accompanied by a report on Islamophobia?\nLast week at Columbia the new acting president Carol Shipman did not wait and asked NYPD for help in evicting violent anti-Israel disruptors from the Butler library where other students were peacefully studying for their final exam. Many troublemakers, most of them women were arrested, and later suspended. Ms. Shipman did send out an urgent letter to Columbia alumni appraising them of the situation at the time of the riot. She did condemn very clearly “antisemitism and all other forms of harassment and discrimination”. Events at University of Washington took similar path – from damage to facilities estimated at $1,000,000 to arrest of 30 students. Brooklyn College and some other institutions followed in the same footsteps. One can only hope that these bastions of higher education started to understand the word “higher”. It still remains concerning, say the least, that it took one year and a half after October 7 massacre and only after interventions of the Congress (not discussed here) and the Administration for university presidents to move reluctantly in addressing and limiting antisemitic activities on their campuses."}

Where Will It Be Built?", "media_type": "blog", "date": "MAY 13, 2025, 1:06 AM", "content": "The First and Second Temples were built from above. A spiritual force came down and united us. They were not the work of people, or in other words, they were states of unity that we did not achieve by ourselves. The upper force, a force of love, bestowal, and connection, granted us that connection as a gift, as a temporary awakening from above to show us what true connection could look like.\nBut why were those Temples destroyed? Why did Tisha B’Av (the 9th of Av) become a day of mourning? It happened so we would begin the work of correction, i.e., the work of transforming our inborn egoistic nature to the altruistic form of the upper force. The Temples were destroyed to awaken in us the need to rebuild, not with stones, but with our own inner efforts. Now, it is no longer about receiving a ready-made connection. We must build it ourselves. Of course, we are not discussing a physical Temple in a geographic location, but what the Temple actually means—a connection between people based on pure love and giving, similar in form to the quality of the upper force that created and sustains us.\nThe Third Temple will not descend from above. We need to long for it. We must feel how deeply we need and demand it. This time, however, we need to do so from below. It will be the result of our conscious effort and collective desire to reach love for one another.\nMoreover, the Third Temple will be built by the whole world, yet not in the way people usually imagine, but in the hearts of those who yearn for the upper force of love, bestowal, and connection to enter their lives. That is where the new sanctuary will stand, in the unified desire of people who seek spiritual connection.\nWho are these people? They are called “Israel.” This is not a biological or national definition. It does not define people who were born to Jewish parents, or those who hold an Israeli passport. “Israel” rather refers to those who genuinely yearn for the upper force, from the words “Yashar-El” (straight to the upper force).\nThose who carry this yearning are responsible for reaching genuine unity among themselves, and the ties of love and bestowal that they establish will extend to the rest of humanity. When this happens, when the world begins to awaken to this spiritual structure, we will witness the construction of the eternal and perfect Third Temple. It is a living bond between human hearts that align with the upper force in its quality of love, bestowal, and positive connection."}

He thinks of the 40 year old Boeing and of the newer Boeing offered by Qatar that he hopes will replace the current Airforce One in a few months and eventually will be for him to use in 2033, at the end of his third mandate.\nAn aide walks in and whispers that Benjamin Netanyahu is on the phone. Trump is reluctant to take the call as he does not like Netanyahu and stil has not forgiven him for congratulating Biden in 2020. However, curious, Trump takes the call.\n„Hi Bibi, whatsup ?“.\nNetanyahu thanks Trump for taking his call and says…\n„ Donald,  I have been thinking on what to do with Gaza. It is true that Israel can destroy all or most of Hamas’ military and political power in Gaza, but I now realize that Israel should not govern Gaza. I also agree with you Donald that we need to make peace. You are the President of peace and you will deserve the Nobel Prize. In fact you already deserve that Prize for freeing Edan Alexander. “\nNetanyahu knows that flattery works with Trump and he continues.\n„ Israel is willing to withdraw from Gaza if a new Palestinian authority takes control, with strong financial support from the Saudis, the Qataris and the Emiratis. The Saudis and the Emiratis must also have boots on the ground to ensure that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad stay out. I do not think that Israel can trust Qatar, so other than money, we do not want them there.“\nNetanyahu knows that Trump has a special relationship with Qatar which not only is giving him a plane, but is also  financing a super duper Trump resort in Doha. However having Qatar in Gaza would be a bridge too far for Israel, unless they give Bibi a plane as well.\nThen Netanyahu goes on…\n„ So, knowing that you have invited Mahmoud Abbas and Ahmed al-Sharaa to meet you in Saudi Arabia, I propose that you invite me as well. As Begin did with Sadat, and under your leadership, I decide that Israel’s interests come before my personal interests and hopefully we will both get the Nobel Prize“.\nMaybe not a smart move to tell Trump to share the Nobel Prize, but his wife Sarah is pushing for that and what Sarah wants is what Sarah gets.\n„ Together with MBS, you and I make the announcement and the Saudi Prince confirms that it will establish diplomatic relations with Israel. My proposal will no doubt be the end of my coalition, but if Ben Gvir and Smotrich leave the government, maybe we can get Lapid and Gantz to let me end my mandate till its scheduled end in October 2026“."}

It was an absolutely harrowing account of the Holocaust, replete with terrible imagery and accounts from this most horrific of crimes against humanity and the Jewish people. But the main take-away from the documentary was unfortunately the role that the USA, and to a certain extent the UK, played in the Holocaust. Much of what I’m discussing in this article is taken from the documentary above and relies upon the documentary as a source of information.\nWhen we think of this dark period of history, the Second World War and the Holocaust, some of the few bright spots are usually represented by the statesmen Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill.\nWe rightly think of these statesmen as fighting against the satanic tyranny of the Nazi regime and saving the world from darkness, in a time when too many countries and peoples were either too weak or too unwilling to put up a fight against Nazi Germany. Specifically in the case of the USA, there was a huge sacrifice paid by upwards of half a million American servicemen who perished during the war in two foreign continents to fight against tyranny and to free the oppressed and occupied masses of Europe and Asia.\nThis account is of course true, but the mistake is that we conflate the staunch opposition to Nazism with a solidarity with the Jewish plight during the Holocaust.\nThe popular Jewish view of the USA\nWhat informs the positive view of the USA is that we have rightly felt that this is a country which has had a big and thriving Jewish population, bigger and more integrated than in any other place during the long exile, and that this country has extended so much support to our beloved and embattled Jewish state, Israel, in the past and in the present. Another major component in this positive view of the Roosevelt administration was the formation of the War Refugee Board in 1944, which in cahoots with the Swedish diplomat Raul Wallenberg helped save upwards of 200 000 Jews from the Holocaust, mainly in Hungary but not only there. It is this commendable effort by Roosevelt’s administration, together with the unassailable fact that the United States were instrumental in liberating Europe and the world from Nazi and Japanese tyranny, which has largely shaped the positive historical view of Roosevelt in posterity.\nThe informed Jewish view of the USA\nBut what happened before 1944, and also after 1945? And how come the Nazis did manage to kill six million Jews during the war? These are painful questions that the film tries to answer.\nThe documentary follows the career of the Jewish-American politician Henry Morgenthau Jr (henceforth called “Morgenthau”), who served as the only Jewish member of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration during the war in the capacity of Treasury Secretary (from 1933 to 1945).\nMorgenthau initial stance-so prevalent during this era among American Jews-that one need not stand out as a Jew in the United States, that one should keep a low profile, and that the newly integrated status of American Jews was precious and precarious. Many American Jews did not want “to rock the boat”, as it were, to worsen their status in the USA, and to create “an Anti-Semitic problem”.\nAs horrific accounts of the Holocaust started to seep in, Morgenthau was increasingly challenged to act, by his Jewish secretary and by his non-Jewish colleagues like Josiah DuBois Jr. They called upon him to act, and his conscience was awakened.\nMorgenthau was a secularized and assimilated Jew, by the standards of the time, and did not want it to seem that he wasn’t an American patriot, that he was somehow biased towards the Jews, and not solely in favor of the interests of the USA.\nAdd to this picture the fact that many prominent Jews in the US, among them the President’s “special advisor on Jewish affairs”-Samuel Rosenman-were actively trying to convince the President not to allow Jewish refugees to flee to America (In the case of Rosenman, I cannot think of any other Jew in history who has caused his kin more suffering than him, he might have the death of millions of his fellow Jews on his conscience, even though it’s hard to quantify a counterfactual event like this).\nThis chimed in well with the view of hardened Anti-Semites in the State Department, like Breckenridge Long, and Henry L. Stimson. The former expressed an understanding for Hitler’s Anti-Semitic agenda (Long would later resign in protest when Roosevelt did eventually start saving Jews in 1944).\nInitially Morgenthau started pushing for payments to be sent to the Jewish refugees who were being killed en masse, on a daily basis. The payments were, among other things, aimed at bribing local officials to let Jews leave (In Romania among other places). The payments did not go through due to stalling tactics and obstruction on the part of the State Department.\nAnother thing Morgenthau tried was to let the Jews flee temporarily to overseas territories controlled by the USA. This was also rebuffed by Roosevelt.\nBut most importantly the USA refused to take in Jewish refugees. The following excuses were made: 1. There was a “quota” for overseas refugees which had to be adhered to. 2. There might be Nazi spies masquerading as refugees.\nThe film clearly rebuffs these two claims: Firstly, there had not been one single case of a Nazi Spy among the Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany. Secondly, the refugee quota to the USA was never filled during the war.\nThe tragic case of the ship of St Louis which arrived at US ports full of German-Jewish refugees but was refused entry and sent back to Germany is tangible evidence of this policy but was merely one example of a whole policy.\nThe latently held Anti-Semitic views of the Allies and most importantly their refusal to accept any Jewish refugees from Germany and other places in Europe, was interpreted by the Nazis as a sign that the Allies didn’t want to save the Jews, and didn’t care about them. The ominous role this might have played in the official formulation of “the Final Solution” by the Nazis in 1941-the wholesale extermination of Europe’s Jewish population-one can only speculate about. It seems safe to say that it played a part, even though that part might have been minor. But that is certainly bad enough.\nLack of a moral compass in confronting Anti-Semitism\nThe Jews were blamed for anything and everything in Europe and wholly demonized. This had started already in 1936 with deportations of Jews from Germany, and continued with the Kristallnacht pogroms in 1938, and became a national policy of genocide after 1939.  There was never a justification to persecute the Jews of Europe. The USA and the Allies (along with Australia and the UK who also actively refrained from saving Jews during the War) lacked the moral compass to understand this. Instead, there were vague explanations of protecting “the Protestant profile” of the USA, and absurdly claiming the moral high ground when refraining from punishing Germany after the war.\nRoosevelt had envoys meet with Hitler to convey his understanding of Hitler’s “concerns” about the Jews. Roosevelt claimed that the USA also had “a Jewish problem”, that too many Harvard students were Jewish, and that the Jewish influence was alarming. Roosevelt’s emissaries tried to calm the Nazis by saying they did not wish to interfere with the handling of “the Jewish question” by the Nazis (this would of course change later).\nThe role of Morgenthau during the war\nThis leads us to what Morgenthau erroneously became most famous for among the wider Nazi and Allied populations during and after the war.\nMorgenthau’s last visit to Europe during the war was in 1944. He then concluded that the only way to prevent this calamity from happening again-more specifically the German attempts at occupying other countries and starting major wars-was to deindustrialize Germany. Without going into depth on the military aspects of the war it was of course crucial to the outbreak of the Second World War and the immense military success that Germany initially had, that the Germans had built up such an immense war machine, even under the terms of the Versailles treaty of 1919 which forbade this. This war machine was of course made possible by the enormous industrial capacity Germany possessed. The Morgenthau plan wanted to prevent the conditions that had made two world wars and untold horrors possible by reducing Germany to an agrarian society.\n“The Morgenthau Plan” of deindustrializing Germany was later rebuffed. The ways in which this plan was rebuffed though are also telling of where the Allies were at this time,\nThe role of the United Kingdom in the Holocaust\nWe will now make a small detour to discuss the closest ally of the USA during the war: The United Kingdom.\nA whole separate historical account can and has been written on the culpability of the UK and the Commonwealth for not preventing the Holocaust. It has been widely established that Churchill knew about the death camps in Poland and refused to bomb the railroad tracks leading to them, transporting millions of Jewish victims to them (“we’ll save them at the end of the war” he is reported to have said, many millions of Jewish lost lives later). But no less importantly, Churchill upheld the notorious White Paper policy of the UK government, preventing and/or severely limiting Jewish immigration to the Palestinian mandate, which was in British hands at the time. This policy was ostensibly there to appease the Arabs.\nThese facts alone should lead many to reappraise Churchill’s canonized status (Bibi Netanyahu has claimed to have a picture of Churchill in his office), but one can and should add his culpability in the millions who died of starvation in India due to his refusal to send food there during a famine during the Second World War. Churchill didn’t mind using Indians (and Jews) as servicemen in the British war effort, but when it came to saving their lives, he was less conscientious.\nBut most poignantly in the case of Morgenthau, Churchill described Morgenthau as “a Shylock” for wanting to deindustrialize Germany. In other words, just as the Jewish Shylock of Shakespeare wanted to enact a perverse sort of revenge against his non-Jewish fellow human beings, Morgenthau was accused of exacting a purportedly irrational revenge against Nazi Germany.\nThe moral hypocrisy of the Allies\nThe American Stimson also denounced Morgenthau in the same vein, accusing him of lacking Christian compassion.\nThis could be deemed the most absurd aspect of Anti-Semitism from a moral perspective. The Anti-Semites first persecute the Jews in the cruelest fashion possible, exhausting every type of human cruelty there is, and even inventing new ones, and then end up accusing the Jews of that very cruelty. This Anti-Semitic trait, of committing the evil and then projecting it on the victim, has a long history, including the Medieval accusations of the Jews eating the blood of Christian children (who eats “the blood of Christ” in “the holy communion”?).\nWhere was the Christian compassion towards Japan during the war? President Harry S. Truman, who succeeded Roosevelt after his death in 1944, proclaimed that “a rain of ruin” would befall Japan. And so it did. Even before the dropping of the two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, killing 120 000 people, Tokyo was firebombed in March 1945 killing 80 000-100 000 people in one night.\nThere was of course “no Christian compassion” shown towards Japan in these events, and even Germany was hardly hit by the carpet bombing of Stuttgart, Dresden, Hamburg and Berlin. But Germany had more friends in the US State Department, as pointed out by Hilan Warshaw.\nMoral lessons for the Jews\n“Hindsight is 20/20”, they say. How can we from our current position judge people who had to make very difficult decisions under very testing circumstances?\nDifficult times are a litmus test for our values. If certain values are deeply embedded, then they tend to make themselves known during crises, especially the deeper and more existential the values are.\nWas opening the borders to Jewish refugees, opening up overseas territories to Jews or even sending money to bribe foreign rulers not to kill innocent Jews really that difficult? I don’t think it was. In fact, the US war-time administration had been shown to have gone to great lengths in trying not to save any Jews prior to 1944 (the feeble attempt of the Bermuda Conference in 1943 notwithstanding).\nThe fact that Roosevelt and Churchill didn’t care about the Jews and may also have been slightly Anti-Semitic doesn’t obscure the fact that they played a pivotal and crucial role in defeating Nazism and its attempt at world domination.\nBut as far as the Jews are concerned, the only constant that one returns to and is as rock solid as ever, as close as to an eternal truth on international relations as it comes, is that we need to act out of a clear sense of NATIONAL SELF-INTEREST. When you see how Churchill and Roosevelt acted during the war, statesmen who are considered to have been “the good guys”, you realize that in all times it is best for the Jews to act out of national self-interest. We Jews, especially us, who are more vilified and victimized than any other ethnic group in history (“the Gypsies” also come to mind, but they are not really a coherent ethnic group as we are) which is all too apparent in our current era, as if all the previous persecutions weren’t enough, where we see groups and individuals from every corner of the world (Africa, South America, Europe, North America and the Middle East), and from every political persuasion almost (leftwing, far right, islamist) rally against the Jews and the Jewish state, blinded by irrational hate, we need to be acutely aware that the yardstick of any moral action we take visavi the Nations, should be: Is it good for the Jews?\nThis yardstick first and foremost entails that an alliance, or the actions of an international actor, is assessed by the extent by which it serves the physical survival of the Jewish nation and Jewish individuals.\nInstead of this yardstock being applied we sadly see the age-old, lamentable tendency of some Jews of putting the world ahead of their own people. In our day and age, it is not traitors like Samuel Rosenman who merely put their host country ahead of saving millions of Jews, but now we have descendants of Jacob fighting “the Palestinian cause”, spearheading or joining the bandwagon in the political struggle against the Jewish state. This is not the way forward and these Jews will not be included in the future of the Jewish people; their offspring won’t be as they are not.\nSiding with President Trump, regardless of all his other faults as a President, which are apparent for everyone to see-whether one is on the left side or on the right side of the political spectrum-is “a no brainer” for anyone who has the physical survival of the Jewish state and the Jewish people at the forefront of his or her concerns. President Trump’s track record of fostering peace between Israel and Arab states like Bahrain, The United Arab Emirates and Marocco, as well as moving the embassy to Jerusalem are a testament to this.\nBut most importantly President Trump’s determination to prevent Iran to achieve nuclear weapons, instead of giving them a get-out-of-jail card in the form of a nuclear treaty, a modern variant of the Munich Agreement in 1938-trusting genocidal dictators to give up on their ideology, is of the highest concern for the Jewish people. The genocidal and Anti-Semitic Iranian regime is the biggest existential threat to the Jewish people since the Nazi regime of Germany. This regime has vowed to wipe Israel off the map and is acquiring nuclear weapons to do so. They are already aiding and abetting the genocidal terrorism that has been directed at us since the 7th of October, and previous to that as well. To add to that, Iran even attacked Israel directly through missile strikes since the 7th of October. Having an American President who understands this danger and sides with us on this issue and is willing to let us defend ourselves freely against this threat is paramount. Nothing can trump this concern (no pun intended).\nIn a world which is still devoid of a clear moral compass, as the stances made against Israel and the Jews show with all clarity, we do not have the luxury to choose who is our ally.  Allies are usually actors whose interests converge with ours, not actors who we share a strong bond of values with, like many people assume must be the case. Many Western organizations and individuals would rather side with Islamist forces from the Dark Ages than with the Middle East’s only democracy. Many LGBT-people would rather side with groups that execute homosexuals without a trial (Hamas) than side with the only Middle Eastern country where LGBT people live freely (Israel).\nIn a world like this it is readily apparent that one lacks many options, and we need to be shrewd in seizing upon those options when they become available.\nThe situation of the Jewish people is eternally precarious until the arrival of the Redeemer, when things will be settled once and for all. Until then realpolitik is the name of the game as it in fact always has been."}

I no longer question his judgements, I believe he has literally sold out America to Qatar.\nQatar is not a democracy. Qatar is not an ally by any stretch of the imagination.  It is a kingdom run by a Islamist family that has been supporting terrorism for decades. Al Jazeera, Qatar’s news outlet, has supported terrorism to the point that even some Arab states have banned it. Hamas leaders openly made their homes there, living lavish life styles under the protection of the monarchy. American colleges and universities have been subverted by billions of dollars supporting Islamist, leftist, and anarchist viewpoints under Qatar’s direction. And now Qatar has also bought the Trump family.\nI was concerned when Trump appointed Steve Witkoff, a person without previous international negotiating experience, to handle the Middle East and subsequently learned that Qatar had bailed Witkoff out of a major real estate deal to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.  Then he had Adam Boehler violate all prior US principles by negotiating directly with the terrorist group Hamas. He was soon fired but then quietly rehired! Scarier still was the 5.6 billion dollar deal Eric Trump signed in Doha with the Qataris to build a Trump tower there. That appeared to me to be on par with the Hunder Biden and Ukraine scandal.\nBut now, Donald Trump has accepted an open bribe. A present from a terrorist supporting regime to the tune of a gold laden, 400 million dollar 747 which will be “temporarily” replacing Air Force One until Mr. Trump leaves office when it will go to his “library”. (In the meantime taxpayers will be paying for the gas, maintenance, and upkeep of this “gift”.) What will the next president then have to fly in?\nI voted for Mr. Trump but now I feel it is time to open a Congressional ethics committee investigation into Mr. Trump’s relationship with Qatar – a state sponsor of terror on par with Iran. The only difference between Iran and Qatar is that Iran has played the “bad cop” while Qatar has played the “good cop”. Their objectives are the same: to overthrow Western democracies and replace them with radical Islamic theocracies! Iran was the front man rattling the West while Qatar was behind the scenes subverting Western democracy.\nI am not a constitutional lawyer, not even a lawyer, but it would appear to me as a citizen of the United States, that Mr. Trumps collusion with a terrorist enemy may have reached the level of “High Crimes” and even treason. I think it is soon time for a real bipartisan impeachment trial. I hope the Republicans in Congress realize that their tyrannical leader, who has usurped unbridled power,  is not the “great white hope” they thought he was. He has sold his soul and the American people to the highest bidder: Qatar."}

A beautiful, inspiring day filled with sunshine, passionate speakers and a strong sense of community. It was moving to gather with fellow activists, many of whom hadn’t met in person before, and share thoughts, feelings and plans for the future. \nInside, the tone was hopeful and determined. We heard from David Collier, the investigative journalist who broke the scandal over the BBC documentary “Gaza, how to survive a war zone”. He laid bare the propaganda pipeline, from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad through to the respectable face of outlets like the BBC and Sky News. We also heard from the CEO of Magen David Adom UK, Daniel Burger, who spoke powerfully about their life-saving mission to save all lives, regardless of race or religion. MSP Jackson Carlaw gave a fiery and heartfelt defence of Scotland’s Jewish community, exposing the warped narratives infiltrating Scottish politics. \nBut perhaps the most powerful part of the day was the space for disagreement. We didn’t all share the same views on the Israeli government, or the peace process, or even the path forward. But we disagreed with respect and integrity. As someone who comes from a leftist background, it was deeply refreshing. A space where disagreement does not mean dehumanisation, silencing and vitriol, but genuine respect for those who say what they believe is right and true, because they believe it is right and true. \nOutside the venue, however, a different story unfolded.\nA small but aggressively loud group of protesters gathered, screaming slogans, banging pots and pans, and trying to intimidate attendees. They failed. We walked through a different door and went about our day. \nBut they stayed. For eight hours.\nWhile we listened they shrieked. While we reached across differences they raged. While we spoke of peace they chanted hate. \nCredit – Leah Benoz\nAt one point their leader, and founder of the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign, was taken into the back of a police van. This was the only time the crowd moved from their position on the steps of the venue. In defence of their figurehead, they surrounded the police van, screaming and frothing with rage, refusing to let it move. They banged on the sides and the bonnet, and attempted to intimidate the police. Some even climbed underneath the wheels, forcing the small team of officers to form a human chain around the van.\nEventually he appeared to be released. Was he arrested and de-arrested? Held to diffuse tensions? Released by outnumbered police who did not have the manpower to control the situation? I have yet to discover exactly what transpired in that police van, but certainly the appearance was one of mob rule, not justice. \nInside, one simple message was repeated time and again. “If you want peace for one side, you must want peace for both”\nGlasgow Friends of Israel’s tagline says it clearly; \nPro Israel.\nPro Palestinian.\nPro Peace. \nSo what, exactly, were they protesting with such rage?\nWhat about this simple message terrified them so much that many of them felt it appropriate to expose their own children, some tiny babies in prams, to eight hours of screaming in megaphones, aggression and hate? \nIt wasn’t our politics that enraged them. \nIt was our refusal to hate. \nIt was the simple, unthreatening notion that both peoples deserve dignity, both Arab and Jew. \nThat’s what they tried to shut down. \nwith permission -Glasgow Friends of Israel\nSunday laid it bare; this is not a movement for justice, it is a movement defined by rage, and increasingly by cult-like loyalty to their worshipped leaders. The public disruption, the cost of policing, the labour of the essential workers they expect to clean up after them, and the risk to the Jewish community, must all be weighed against this simple fact, because this wasn’t about Israel, it wasn’t even about Gaza, it was about silencing Jews, even, and most especially when we talk of peace.\nVicci and Sammy Stein, the founders of Glasgow Friends of Israel, can be immensely proud of what they have built in the last ten years, and the hate-filled crowd outside can rest uncomfortably in the knowledge that all they managed to achieve was to highlight without any doubt, the absolute contrast between their darkness and our light. \nAt the close of the day, as Sammy said a prayer for the hostages in Hebrew and English, and Ariella Knoble-Gershon, representing both the Board of Deputies and the Hostage Family Forum UK, lit a candle. I was reminded, as I am every time I stand with this community, that there is no doubt in my mind where I would rather be. "}

Despite being miles away and not being a direct party to the India-Pakistan standoff, Israel became a hot point of discussion with regard to the nature of the conflict in Kashmir and Islamabad and Delhi’s drastically different approaches to the long-standing Israel-Palestine issue.\nSocial media were flooded with posts on Israel by mostly Indians, touting their “allyship” and supposed similarity of situations of being confronted with terror and thereby acting upon it. The Israeli ambassador to India extended support to New Delhi’s action and strikes in Pakistan — without taking the latter’s name —stating that Israel supports “India’s right for self-defense”. “Terrorists should know there’s no place to hide from their heinous crimes against the innocent,” he wrote on X. \nPakistanis, on the other hand, in their protests and posts lambasted both countries, seeing them as a common enemy; some even denounced the Indian and Israeli flags in protests during the intense week. Pakistan’s military, during the height of tensions with India, said it shot down Israeli-made drones launched by the Indian military into Pakistani airspace, following a series of strikes across the country earlier. The military said it had shot down 25 Israeli Harops, including in the major cities of Karachi and Lahore.   \nIndia maintains strategic ties with major Israeli defense firms and remains a strong market for Israeli weapons. This association and camaraderie, however, does not automatically make Islamabad and Jerusalem adversaries, contrary to local Indian and Pakistani populations’ widely-held beliefs. Israel excels in war technology and provides weapons to whoever asks for them, including New Delhi, and it would be willing to provide them to Islamabad if the latter indulges in bilateral engagements on a set of issues. Israel is also an arms supplier to  Azerbaijan, a Muslim country, and assisted it in its fight in Nagorno-Karabakh. Religion or conspiracy theories of the “Hindu-Jewish” and “India-Israel” alliance reeking at antisemitism that is rife on Pakistani social media have little to do with it, are inaccurate and not grounded in reality.\nDuring the standoff, India also used French fighter jets which Pakistan downed, but no theories of an “India-France alliance” or “Hindu-Christian conspiracy” were circulated anywhere.\nIsrael has never declared Pakistan an enemy and in many instances has refrained from mentioning the country altogether. During a visit to India in 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed suggestions that his country’s partnership with India was a threat to Pakistan, saying, “We (Israel) are not enemies of Pakistan and Pakistan should not be our enemy either.” \nBoth India and Pakistan were urged to show restraint during the recent standoff by Western capitals. The response from the US initially was less consequential, as evident from Vice President JD Vance’s statement that said the India-Pakistan war was “none of our business” until, as reports claim, he received alarming intelligence. As Pakistan went tit-for-tat with its counterstrikes, it established much-needed deterrence, forcing India to come to the negotiating table after intervention from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio — a diplomatic channel New Delhi has avoided ever since Prime Minister Modi and his Hindu nationalist BJP party came to power.\nAs far as Israel is concerned, Pakistan’s foreign policy remains pro-Palestinian to the point of being self-sabotaging. It gives India an edge too in its relations with the Jewish state. Instead of being heavily one-sided, religiously-motivated and counterproductive to any rapprochement as it is now — especially when Palestinians and most Arab states, despite the recent OIC statement, do not extend the same unflinching solidarity and support to Islamabad in its disputes with India and pursue their own bilateral relations — Pakistan should aim for the same and center its strategic objectives first, even if that means developing ties with Israel. This is what successful Islamic countries like the United Arab Emirates have done. It will have to start with the deradicalization of Pakistani society on a scale not seen before and tightening the noose around extremist parties which are antisemitic and anti-minorities instead of being a reasonable political force against India, an adversary that seeks to isolate Pakistan on every global avenue. \nThe escalation with India has stressed the need to establish more ties, including with Israel and challenge New Delhi’s regional hegemony. The day of normalization — which Israel has always been eager to see with Islamic states, including Pakistan — may be far away, but that day will come. The first step in that long chain of process will have to be the deradicalization of the populace in a country like Pakistan. "}

The war started on October 7, 2023, when the Palestinian terror group Hamas led an invasion of southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 251 abducted as hostages to Gaza.\nThere have been repeated calls from groups of reservists to not turn up for duty over the past two years, mostly as a protest against the government’s planned judicial overhaul, seen as undermining democracy, and against the renewed fighting in Gaza, which critics say is a political move that will endanger the lives of the remaining hostages.\nThere is also mounting discontent at the number of days reservists have being asked to serve since the start of the Gaza war, with some called up for hundreds of days. This has been exacerbated by government efforts to legislate an exemption for tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox youths from the draft.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nLast month, the IDF said it would take strong action against reservists who refuse to serve.\nIDF troops operate in the Gaza Strip, in a handout photo published on May 11, 2025. (Israel Defense Forces)\nYahalom is a master’s student at the Hebrew University. He was called up for 110 days of duty with his unit in the West Bank’s Jordan Valley, Kan said.\nAccording to the unsourced report, he declared that he would not serve in the “occupied West Bank or the ongoing war in Gaza.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe reportedly specified he would not “take part in IDF operations” in the West Bank. During the court-martial, he also said, “I see the current campaign in Gaza as clearly illegal” and declared that he has “a moral duty to refuse.”\nAccording to the Yesh Gvul activism group, which supports soldiers who object to Israel’s control of the West Bank, since the start of the Gaza war hundreds of reservists have refused to carry out their duties for ideological reasons.\nIshai Menuchin, spokesman for the group, told Kan that Yahalom’s incarceration was “a worsening of the attitude of the IDF and indicates growing pressure on the army due to the current wave of refusers.”\nAn IAF F-15 takes off to conduct strikes on Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip on October 15, 2023. (IDF)\nSix months ago, a reservist was court-martialed and given a two-week suspended sentence for refusing to serve. Then, in March, an Israeli Air Force reservist navigator was “permanently” dismissed from the military after he posted on social media that he would not show up for reserve duty.\nMost of those who have refused have just been sent home, Kan said.\nA recent wave of calls began in April with a group of roughly 1,000 Israeli Air Force veterans, the vast majority of whom are in retirement, who published a letter urging refusal to serve.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Air Force veterans were then joined by a group of some 150 ex-Navy officers and dozens of reservist doctors who signed their names to letters demanding an immediate end to the war for the sake of the remaining hostages. Former Mossad members, ex-IDF paratroopers, and graduates of an elite military program have also given their support.\nThe army recently issued tens of thousands of call-up orders for IDF reservists ahead of a planned major offensive in the Gaza Strip.\nAmid mass protests in 2023 against the government’s controversial judicial overhaul agenda, several groups of reservists, including some in the IAF, issued statements saying they would refuse to serve under a regime they no longer viewed as democratic.\nAt the height of the 2023 protests, hundreds of IDF reservists signed declarations saying they would no longer show up for reserve duty to protest the government advancing its plans to curtail the judiciary.\nHowever, when war erupted in Gaza on October 7, 2023, with the Hamas-led attacks and massacres, nearly 300,000 reservists showed up for duty, marking the largest-ever call-up of reservists in Israel’s history."}

Palestinians — including the families of prisoners and slain attackers — will be able to apply for welfare stipends, and bureaucrats will adjudicate whether each applicant will receive payments and how much based on economic criteria, Palestinian and US officials have told The Times of Israel.\nThe transition to the new system has taken time, but last month, senior Palestinian official Hussein al-Sheikh — who has since been formally appointed Abbas’s deputy — penned a letter to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio inviting the Trump administration to send a delegation to Ramallah from June 1 onward in order to certify that the PA has implemented the reform and is in compliance with US legislation that bars American aid that directly benefits the PA so long as its previous prisoner payment system remained in place.\nPalestinian sources told The Times of Israel in March and April that families of prisoners and slain attackers were still receiving stipends based on the old system, as the new system was not in place.

She finished up her basic training on Wednesday, October 4, and arrived at the Nahal Oz outpost the next day. Less than 48 hours later, she was slain in the Hamas onslaught along with 14 other observation soldiers.\nHer brother said she called him at 6:54 a.m. that Saturday and told him that terrorists had stormed across the border and “to warn everyone,” while he heard the sounds of grenades and volleys on gunfire in the background. She assured her family that everything was OK and that she had to hang up to run to the bomb shelter. That was the last they heard from her.\nShe was considered missing for several days until her family was informed on Wednesday evening that her body had been identified.\nShe was buried on October 12 in Petah Tikva. She is survived by her parents, Keren and Moshe, and her brothers Yonatan and Ben.\nHer younger brother, Ben, 12, wrote on Instagram that his sister had “the most perfect laugh, we called you ‘shikuti‘ at home because you always wanted us to kiss you and to pay attention to you and you succeeded in that. You were always here for us, I love you always and I am sure that you are in heaven and sitting in the chair of honor like a true queen.

Regev Amar, 20, a soldier in the Paratroopers Brigade, from Kibbutz Sde Nehemia, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas attack on Kibbutz Kissufim.\nThe morning of the attack, Regev and his comrades were in the middle of a squad commander’s course with the Bismalach Brigade at a base next Yeruham, but were immediately called into action.\nThey arrived in the area around 9 a.m. and engaged in several battles with Hamas gunmen at junctions near the Gaza border. They headed toward the area of Nahal HaBesor park, continuing to engage in gun battles along the way.\nThe team then arrived at Kibbutz Kissufim and engaged in heavy gunfire with the Hamas terrorists who had invaded the kibbutz. Regev was shot three times, and according to his family, his comrades wanted to try and rescue him but he told them not to risk their lives in doing so. He died shortly afterward, alongside Staff Sgt. Adam Agmon, Staff Sgt. Omri Peretz, Sgt. Bar Yankilov, Sgt. Lavi Buchnik and Sgt. Matan Malka.\nRegev was buried in Sde Nehemia on October 12. He is survived by his parents, David and Gilanit, and his sisters Roni and Shaked.\nBorn in the US, Regev moved to Israel with his parents when a year old after they completed their time stationed there as emissaries and settled in Kibbutz Sde Nehemia in the Upper Galilee.\nThere, middle-child Regev grew up surrounded by animals, streams and many friends, according to an IDF eulogy. An inquisitive child who was always thirsty for knowledge, he attended schools in the nearby Kfar Blum.\nHe played water polo for many years, and loved to travel around the country, bouncing from Eilat to the Golan Heights and the Dead Sea, his loved ones said. He explored nature and knew how to identify animal tracks, plants, insects and constellations.\nAfter finishing high school, Regev did a year of national service at the Ein Gedi field school, during which he served as a tour guide.\nHe enlisted in the IDF in December 2021, beginning training in the elite Shayetet 13 naval force, although after 10 months he was dropped from the course. He then spent several months in the Duvdevan commando unit before settling in the Paratroopers Brigade as a Negevist.\nJust a couple of months before he was killed, Regev began a squad commander’s course. He dreamed of later completing an officer’s course, eventually studying medicine and returning to the army as a commander, his family said.\nHis mother, Gilanit, told a local news outlet that Regev’s father picked his name, which means a patch of land, years before he was born, “and Regev did have a connection to the land and to the country. A very strong connection.”\nGilanit said that while he had a challenging childhood, his time playing water polo really changed him, “and he blossomed from a skinny boy into a large man, strong and sturdy. He was always surrounded by friends. He was always the center of things in the kibbutz and later as a volunteer. When anyone needed help they would call Regev.”\nShe said her son was a “brilliant child” who completed many more majors in high school than he needed to, focusing on math, physics, Bible and geography, “for his soul and also for the future. He was full of knowledge. A genius. The salt of the earth.”\nGilanit said Regev had many dreams for the future: “When he was in high school he said he wanted to be the next IDF chief of staff. When he grew up he said he wanted to be the next prime minister. In the army he wanted to become an officer, it was important to him. He said that his goal was to lead and educate the next generation of soldiers.”\nAfter the army she said, he dreamed of studying medicine and had already started studying for the matriculation exam: “Regev was a man with values and an ideology. In 21 years he managed to do what people don’t get to in 70 years. An incredible boy who became an angel.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

They spotted a cell of four terrorists and managed to kill three of them, and Maor exited the jeep in order to get a better angle. He was hit with heavy gunfire from hidden Hamas gunmen and was killed.\nMaor was buried in Kfar Ahim shortly before his 47th birthday. He is survived by his wife, Hila, their three children, Yair, Barak and Sahar, his parents, Sima and Shlomo and his siblings Naomi, Boaz and Yehonatan.\nMaor began his service in the Shin Bet in 2000, according to a eulogy from the intelligence agency.\nThe Shin Bet eulogy said that over the years Maor “dealt impressively with significant changes, gained experience and served in a number of challenging positions, both operational and managerial while maintaining a steadfastness and an uncompromising execution of his role.” Maor, it said, was “humble, authentic, attentive, tolerant and empathetic… with deep-rooted Zionist values, he was a role model to many.”\nIn 2022, Maor retired from active service with the Shin Bet, in order to spend more time with his family and be more active in his community, but enlisted in a reserves unit connected to the agency.\nHe and his wife and three children made their home in the small community of Arugot outside Kiryat Malachi. Maor was an active volunteer and member in a number of organizations, including as an EMT with United Hatzalah, the Yedidim organization to assist stranded motorists and the Israeli Association of PPC (powered parachute) Pilots.\nThe PPC organization remembered Maor as “doing everything with an endless smile that infected and delighted his copilots in the southern group… To us, Maor was one of a kind, always helping and always looking forward to the next flight.”\nRoi Asraf, who met Maor through Yedidim, wrote on Facebook that through their work, “I was blessed with a great man of kindness, who chased good deeds and helped everyone without hesitation.” Roi said that whenever he asked Maor about his work with the Defense Ministry, “he would say that he was simply a lowly clerk. So much modesty… He gave of his time, his energy out of his love for the land of Israel. He was a man who could be described as the salt of the earth.”\nAt his funeral, a eulogy written by Maor was read out, in which he said, “You don’t need to say too many things about me, I was just one of 8 billion people. Not the most talented, not the most important. I came, I lived, and I will return to dust.”\n“Don’t be sad because of me,” he continued. “I lived a full life with you. Continue to be happy together, because there is so much left in life.

Aner and many others, including Ayelet Arnin, Laor Abramov, Tamar Samet and Segev Kizhner were slain inside the shelter. Four people were kidnapped — Alon Ohel, Eliya Cohen, Or Levy — whose wife, Eynav, was murdered there — and Aner’s close friend Hersh, who was murdered in captivity close to a year later.\n“Aner Shapiro… saved our lives and he deserves a a medal of honor for being an angel who guarded us,” wrote attack survivor Agam in a Facebook post. Agam, who was herself injured as she crouched inside the doorless shelter, said that when the terrorists first approached, Aner declared his intention to block the grenade attacks and rallied others to help him.\nAner was buried on Jerusalem’s Mount Herzl on October 13. He is survived by his parents, Shira and Moshe, and his six younger siblings, Talia, Ayala, Ariel, Tamara, Alma and Hila.\nHe grew up in the Arnona neighborhood of Jerusalem, as the oldest of seven in a religious family, attending the Himmelfarb school in the capital before enlisting in the IDF. He had dreamed of serving in the elite Sayeret Matkal unit but was wounded twice during tryouts, ultimately joining the Nahal Brigade and eventually serving in the Orev company in its special forces unit.\nHis great-grandfather was Haim Moshe Shapiro, a former Israeli lawmaker and minister who was a signatory of Israel’s Declaration of Independence. Shapiro was seriously injured when a Jewish immigrant, Moshe Dwek, threw a grenade into the Knesset plenum hall in 1957.\nAs a young child, Aner was always creating, writing stories, illustrating them, playing the piano and eventually discovered a love for rap and hip-hop. He had composed and produced five songs before he was killed, and a sixth song, “Hatred of Brothers,” was posthumously produced with the help of rapper and producer Avery G., and with rapper Shaanan Streett of Hadag Nachash, who wrote and recorded a final verse.\n“He had a personality of leadership and a love of people,” his father, Moshe, told The Jerusalem Post in an interview. “Aner was born 22 years ago, a Jerusalem boy with a great love for music and painting. Until the age of 18, he was a painter; and on the other hand, he really loved sports and fitness.”\n“He had a developed sense of justice and love for people. If he saw someone not being properly taken care of, he would get angry and go to their aid,” Moshe added. “He really liked to sit with people and talk to them. He wrote songs, composed and sang, and left hundreds of written texts. Dealing with pressing issues in Israeli society is what kept him busy.”\nHis mother, Shira, told Ma’ariv a year after he was killed that “Aner is still here, I’m his mother even more so now. People can keep living after death in a very powerful way, and that’s what happened with Aner. His breakthrough into the public consciousness in light of what happened is just one element. But his music, his personality are also alive with us, very much so. Despite him physically not being here.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

Bilha and Yakov were survived by their five children, Mor, Maayan, Maoz, Magal and Magen, and 11 grandchildren.\nIn an interview with Channel 12 news in February, Maayan Inon said, “Dad sent us a WhatsApp message at 7:30 a.m. that they’re sitting in the safe room, the house is locked, and they’re hearing a lot of shooting and rockets.”\n“By 7:45 a.m. they were already disconnected and not answering,” she said. “The house got a direct hit [likely from an RPG] and was on fire within minutes.

First Class Mulugeta “Mulu” Gadif, 29, a police officer in the coordination of enforcement operations unit, from Kiryat Gat, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Be’eri.\nWith the start of the attack, Mulugeta was home with his family, and knew he would be called up to the front lines. He headed out to meet up with his team, and they went in the direction of Sderot before being told to head to Kibbutz Be’eri.\nNine police officers and a civilian — Ziv Shopen — entered Be’eri together in two armored jeeps, and almost immediately were ambushed by Hamas gunmen who fired RPGs at them and opened fire. Mulu, Ziv and seven other police officers were killed, including Sgt. 1st Class Dor Mangadi and Supt. Vadim Blih.\nAmid the chaos in Be’eri and the heavy damage caused by the RPGs, Mulu’s body was not identified for a week. He was buried on October 16 in Kiryat Gat.\nHe is survived by his wife, Tali, their baby, Elia, his parents, Belaynesh (Sara) and Adana, and his younger siblings Malasa, Terualem (Rivka) and Temesgen.\nThe oldest in the family, Mulu was born in Gondar, Ethiopia. He attended local schools, loved to write, draw and crochet kippot, and was a successful athlete in both soccer and gymnastics, according to a state eulogy.\nIn 2007, when Mulu was 12, his family moved to Israel and lived in an absorption center in Beersheba, while he attended a dormitory school in Jerusalem. In 2009, his mother was in a bad car accident and was hospitalized for more than a year, during which Mulu diligently visited every day and slept by her bedside, continuing to care for her devotedly in the years afterward.\nAfter graduating high school, Mulu attended the Oz Shlomo pre-military academy in Merkaz Shapira, and then enlisted in the IDF, serving as a sharpshooter in the Duvdevan commando unit. Toward the end of his service, he met Tali, and the couple got engaged in 2021 and married a year later. Their daughter, Elia, was born in May 2023. The couple had bought an apartment in Holon and were waiting for it to be refurbished before moving in.\nFollowing his release from the army, Mulu worked as a security guard and in the evenings he established a local soccer team for youth in Kiryat Gat. In March 2023, he fulfilled his dream of enlisting in the Israel Police.\nTali told a local news site that the couple had so many plans for the future that were cut short: “We didn’t get to move into our new apartment, Mulu barely got to know his daughter, or to do what we planned to accomplish together.”\nEven though their daughter knew her father for just five months, “she is aware that he is missing. He would come home every day from work and talk to her, laugh with her, she knew his voice. Every time anyone knocks on the door and she looks that way, when she sees that it’s not him she is sad.” Tali said that the little comfort she has, “is that Mulu died as he wanted, as a hero, as a leader who did everything he could to save others.”\nHis mother, Belaynesh (Sara), wrote on Facebook that she gave birth to Mulu, her firstborn, when she was 14, “and for 29 years I was so happy with him and my husband and my children.”\nHe was a doting older brother to his younger siblings, she said, “Mulu for me was everything, my whole world… he was such a brave and talented boy.” While she was recovering from her accident, Mulu “took care of me and treated me and did everything to strengthen me… the whole time I hoped and prayed for Mulu that he would be happy, and that everything he did would succeed.”\n“The connection between Mulu and me was unique, we were really like good friends, we would talk about everything, things that only knew,” she continued. “I want everyone to know, all the people of Israel, that he fell in order to protect the State of Israel and its citizens so that we can live here in peace and love and brotherhood.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

Piecing together his final moments from video, evidence and testimony, his family believes that Doron — after helping treat wounded at the site of the rave — left via car and headed in the direction of Be’eri.\nNear the kibbutz, he was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists and placed in the back of a pickup truck with others being kidnapped from Be’eri.

Already during the shiva [mourning period] I said that there was no way I wasn’t going to open the food truck that he dreamed of. That there was no way I wasn’t passing along his love.”\nShay said Doron “was really worth of admiration, he loved to help people and was always full of optimism. I never encountered him crying or annoyed, he was always satisfied by life and everything he encountered.

The group got off the bus to try to enter a roadside bomb shelter only to find it locked.\nNot long after, a truckful of terrorists who drove by murdered all of them, with only the bus driver surviving. Photos of the bodies of elderly people strewn on the ground next to a bus station were among the first to emerge from the atrocities of October 7, shocking the nation and the world.\nZina is survived by her husband, Lev, her mother, Galina, sons Alex and Ilan, her brother Iliya and a granddaughter. She was buried in Ra’anana on October 16.\nMendi Rizel described her as a friend of the family and said she was an accountant “and a wonderful woman who always had laughter on her face,” as well as active in the local Sderot Chabad house.\nHer niece, Roni Beylin, noted on Facebook that Zina was among the organizers of the trip, and had been doing so for close to a decade.\n“Sometimes me and my cousin would go with them and we accumulated no small amount of memories and laughter,” she noted. “My aunt was a unique woman.”\nHer friend Emilia Feldman told Israel’s Russian-language Channel 9 TV station that Zina “was a festive person, cheerful, smiling, full of strength. Many people in the city knew her.” Emilia joked that they used to call her “the ‘tourism minister,’ because her passion was travel.

Yonadav Levenstein, 23: Fell 2 months after his wedding", "media_type": "article", "date": "16 May 2024, 6:40 pm", "content": "Staff Sgt. Yonadav Raz Levenstein, 23, a soldier in the Givati Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, was killed while fighting Hamas in the northern Gaza Strip on November 3.\nHe grew up in Ma’ale Adumim, the child of Canadian immigrants, and lived in Jerusalem. He was killed just two months after his wedding to Hadar.\nYonadav was buried on November 5 on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. He is survived by his wife, Hadar, his mother Leora and and his five older siblings, Merav, Elnatan, Atara, Tzahala and Avital. He was predeceased by his father, Michael.\nYonadav’s tall stature and striking red beard led many of his friends and comrades to refer to him as “the viking.” He met his wife, Hadar, while the two were working at the City of David archeological digs before he enlisted in the army — something he had to fight for after getting into trouble in his high school years.\nEnlisting at age 21, Yonadav fought his way to the Givati Brigade, and on October 7 his unit was called to the front lines, where they battled against Hamas in Kibbutz Nir Oz. Several weeks later, he was among the first troops to enter Gaza with the start of the ground invasion.\nOn October 24, Yonadav sent a message to his newlywed wife via the Walla news site, taking the microphone while stationed on a base in the south and saying simply: “Hi, I’m Yonadav Levenstein from Jerusalem, I want to say hi to my wife, Hadar — I love you very much.”\nFamily and friends of Staff Sgt. Yonadav Raz Levenstein, an IDF soldier killed in Gaza, mourn at his funeral at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem on November 5, 2023. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nYonadav was remembered as having a wide range of hobbies, including music — playing the piano, guitar and harmonica — being talented at basketball, a keen student of history and having a love of hiking and travel. When they were first dating, Hadar and Yonadav hiked the Israel Trail together, and had plans for a global honeymoon once he was released from the army.\nAt his funeral, his mother, Leora, noted that despite being the youngest of six, “you grew up to be an independent boy, teen and man, smart, opinionated, strong and hardworking — but always with the warmest and sweetest smile in the world and the biggest heart.”\nThree years earlier, she said, when Yonadav’s father was “on his deathbed, he made sure to say how proud he was of you for the path you set for yourself. He was happy with your work in the City of David excavations, where you combined your impressive physical strength with your love for Jewish history and your deep understanding and knowledge in all areas connected to the heritage of the Jewish people.”\nAnd there, she noted, was where he met Hadar, “and what a wise and mature choice you made when you decided she would be your partner for life… such a beautiful couple, connected by a unique covenant of love, complementing each other in divine harmony.”\nSpeaking to the Makor Rishon newspaper, Hadar described her husband as a “sort of huge viking with the soul of a child.”\n“He was a fascinating conversationalist, so interesting and measured,” she recalled of their early days working together at the City of David. “Yonadav truly loved the Land of Israel and its history, and knew so much… he was an autodidact, he taught himself to play the piano, the guitar, the harmonica, he was a super talented musician. When we would visit his mother, he would hug her and immediately sit down to play songs with me next to him — I miss that.”\nEnlisting at a slightly older age, she said, made him a big brother and leader figure to many of his comrades, who came to pay their condolences during the shiva.\n“Like in life, also in the army, for all the complicated tasks he was the first,” she said. “They always knew they had someone to rely on, and knew that there was someone here who came to work.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

The German Foreign Office told MDR it had no information confirming such a visit, the report said.\n“The documents show that several countries likely had more accurate information on Mengele than previously thought,” Musial said. Mengele’s identity was well-protected during his exile, despite significant attempts by the German government and the Mossad to capture him, he noted.\nMengele, a German SS officer and physician, was notorious for his experiments on twins, pregnant women, and individuals with physical abnormalities, often without anesthesia and with lethal results. Mengele played a central role in the selection process upon prisoners’ arrival, deciding who would be sent to forced labor and who would be killed immediately.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nAfter the war, Mengele fled Europe in 1949 and evaded capture until his death of a heart attack in 1979.\nEarlier this month, Argentina released nearly 1,850 classified documents that show how Nazi fugitives fled to the country after World War II, providing new details about the so-called ratlines that helped Nazis escape Europe after the Holocaust.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe documents, now publicly available through Argentina’s National Archive, include banking and financial transactions that show how Nazis were able to resettle in Argentina, as well as records held by Argentina’s Defense Ministry.\nThey include nearly 100 pages with detailed information about Mengele’s stay in Argentina and police searches for him, the report found.\nFor decades, organizations like the Simon Wiesenthal Center, named after the famed Nazi hunter, have sought records related to unofficial escape routes taken by thousands of Nazis in the years after World War II. Up to 10,000 Nazis and other fascist war criminals escaped justice by fleeing to Argentina and other countries.\nSeveral other countries in the Americas received Nazis, including Canada, the US, and Mexico. Nazis also fled to Australia, Spain, and Switzerland. In some cases, US intelligence officials used ratlines to pluck top Nazi scientists away from Soviet orbits.\nUp to 5,000 Nazis are said to have settled in Argentina, including Mengele and Holocaust architect Adolf Eichmann, who was captured by Israeli agents in 1960 and executed two years later."}

During that time, he told Witkoff that Israel is prepared to hold talks on a permanent end to the war, without committing to such a result up front, the first Arab official said.\nHamas has flatly rejected this framework, arguing that it had already agreed to release hostages during a January truce deal that was supposed to see Israel hold talks regarding a permanent end to the war, however, Netanyahu then refused to enter such negotiations and ended up resuming the IDF’s offensive in Gaza on March 18.\nAccordingly, Hamas has insisted on an up-front Israeli commitment to end the war before it releases additional hostages. It also issued a statement on Thursday, warning of harm to the talks if Israel doesn’t end its nearly two-and-a-half-month-long blockade on aid entering Gaza. Israel has accused Hamas of stealing much of the aid that was previously brought in.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nDue to both sides’ intransigence, Witkoff has offered a proposal that tries to meet the sides halfway — one that would see the release of a smaller number of hostages in exchange for a weekslong truce, the two Arab officials said. The Trump envoy has also tried to assure Hamas through mediators that the US will make sure that this time Israel does enter talks regarding the terms of a permanent ceasefire.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (C), Defense Minister Israel Katz (L) and Brig.

(Screenshot)\nThe Arab officials said the sides remain far apart, but that the American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators were still looking to push them toward a compromise over the coming days.\nIsrael has pledged to launch a major military operation to reoccupy and hold onto the entire Strip if Hamas doesn’t accept its proposal for a temporary ceasefire by the time Trump wraps up his Mideast trip on Friday.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBut Arab mediators hope that the US will convince Israel to at least hold off on the operation for several more days, as they wait to determine the results of a Tuesday IDF strike targeting Hamas’s Gaza leader, Muhammad Sinwar. Scores of civilians were also reportedly killed, according to Hamas-linked health officials in Gaza.\nIsraeli officials have characterized Sinwar as a major obstacle in previous negotiations and hope that his elimination will lead Hamas to compromise. But Israeli optimism that Sinwar was indeed killed has begun to wane, according to the second Arab official who was briefed on the matter.\nArab leaders were also slated to gather for a summit in Baghdad on Saturday that will focus on Gaza, and were hoping that the Israeli offensive wouldn’t be launched during that confab, the second Arab official added.\nWhile they continue to follow Witkoff’s lead in the negotiations, Qatar and Egypt believe the strategy should be to push the sides toward a permanent end to the war, the first Arab official said.\nHamas has already agreed to forgo governing control over the Strip, and at least five Arab countries are still prepared to take part in the post-war management of Gaza in what they argue would lead to the gradual disarmament of Hamas, the Arab official said, acknowledging that it would require an invitation from the Palestinian Authority, which Netanyahu has refused to accommodate.\nIf the creation of a political horizon for the Palestinians is absent, demands for permanent Hamas disarmament would not be met, the Arab official asserted.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAn Israeli strike in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip on May 15, 2025 (Bashar TALEB / AFP)\nWitkoff largely agrees with the Arab approach and told hostages’ families last week that the Netanyahu government’s plan to massively expand the war will not be effective, according to a source present for the discussion.\nWhen he was pressed during another meeting with families on Tuesday on why the US was not then willing to force Netanyahu to end the war, Witkoff responded, “We’re not the Israeli government…The Israeli government is a sovereign government. They can’t tell us what to do, and we can’t tell them what to do,” according to a recording of the meeting obtained by Haaretz.\nWitkoff’s office did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\nHamas has proposed releasing all of the hostages at once in exchange for an end to the war, but Netanyahu has rejected this trade, arguing that it would leave Hamas in power.\nSuccessive polls have indicated that the premier is out of step with the majority of Israelis, who back such a framework. But Netanyahu is also facing pressure from his far-right coalition partners, who have threatened to collapse the government if he were to end the war in exchange for the remaining 58 hostages, between 20 and 23 of whom are believed to still be alive."}

It’s not like you’re trying to save something. There’s no building. People are living under the rubble of buildings that collapsed, which is not acceptable,” he said of the Palestinian territory.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe said he wanted the United States to “take” Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone”: “I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good. Make it a freedom zone. Let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,” he said. “I’d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone.”\nThe president’s meaning was not immediately clear.

Gaza has been a territory of death and destruction,” he added.\nLittle has come so far of the latest indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, led by Trump’s envoys and Qatari and Egyptian mediators in Doha.\nHamas says it is ready to free all the remaining hostages it is holding in Gaza in return for an end to the war, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prefers interim truces, saying the war can only end once Hamas is no longer in control of Gaza. Previous short ceasefires that saw batches of hostages released also had Israel releasing thousands of Palestinian security prisoners, including some convicted of murdering Israelis.\n“At a time when mediators are exerting intensive efforts to put the negotiation back on the right track, the Zionist occupation responds to those efforts by military pressure on innocent civilians,” the Hamas terror group said in a statement Thursday.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Netanyahu wants an open-ended war and he doesn’t care about the fate of his hostages,” it said.\nAn Israeli strike in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip on May 15, 2025 (Bashar TALEB / AFP)\nTrump also said, “We are dealing with Hamas and Iran and the Houthis, and that was I think, very successful.”\nHe was referring to US strikes on the Iran-backed Yemeni group that has been launching missiles and drones at Israel and attacking shipping lanes in the Red Sea in support of Gaza. After two months of intensive US airstrikes, Washington earlier this month reached a ceasefire with the Houthis, who agreed to stop targeting American ships in the vital shipping route but have continued to fire missiles at Israel.\nIsrael’s air defense systems have stopped most of the Houthi attacks, but some missiles and drones have slipped through. Last week, a missile landed within the territory of Ben Gurion Airport, causing most foreign airlines to suspend flights to the country. Israel responded with strikes that destroyed significant Houthi infrastructure.\nThe Houthis say they will only stop if there is an end to the war in Gaza. Another round of mediated talks for a ceasefire and hostage-release deal began in Doha on Wednesday.\nHowever, Qatar’s prime minister told CNN in an interview that Israel’s attacks in Gaza this week send a signal that it is not interested in negotiating a ceasefire.\nSheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said a US-backed humanitarian aid distribution plan for Gaza was unnecessary, stressing the United Nations should be allowed to deliver aid to the war-torn enclave.\nQatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani speaks on the sideline of the 55th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF), in Davos on January 21, 2025.

The IDF has not yet confirmed whether Sinwar, the younger brother of former Hamas leader and October 7 terror mastermind Yahya Sinwar, was killed in the strike.\nHamas authorities claimed that strikes killed over 100 people on Thursday and at least 80 on Wednesday.

Trump has repeatedly said he believes brokering a deal is possible, but that the window is closing.\nThe president’s strongly worded push on Iran to cease support of Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen comes after its proxy network suffered significant setbacks in the 19 months since Hamas launched its devastating October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, triggering war in the Gaza Strip.\nIn Iran, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called Trump’s remarks “deceitful” but did not directly address the US leader’s call on Iran to cease support of proxy groups.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“What he stated about willing of the regional nations for a progressive, flourishing path, is the same path that people of Iran decided through their revolution, indeed, for having a fully independent, democratic, free, wealthy and advanced country,” Araghchi said.\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, left, speaks with his Emirati counterpart Sheik Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan during a meeting, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, May 12, 2025.

The fighting with Hezbollah escalated into open war in September, which ended with a ceasefire last November after Israel decimated the terror group’s leadership and resources.\nThe Houthis are still firing at Israel and though most missiles and drones have been thwarted by air defense systems — including a missile on Wednesday morning — some have slipped through, killing a person in Tel Aviv and causing damage on other occasions. Last week, a missile hit within the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport, prompting international carriers to halt flights to Israel. Retaliatory Israeli airstrikes have destroyed significant Houthi-controlled infrastructure in Yemen.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTrump in March ordered the US to carry out intensive strikes on the Houthis, citing the group’s attacks on shipping in the Red Sea as part of its campaign against Israel, disrupting a vital global sea route. Earlier this month, he announced a ceasefire agreement had been reached under which the Houthis agreed to no longer attack US Navy or American ships in the Red Sea, though they said they would continue attacking Israel.\nIn Riyadh, Trump also said that he believed the moment was ripe “for a [Lebanese] future free from the grip of Hezbollah terrorists.” The terror group is severely weakened after its war with Israel, in which much of its top leadership was killed, and after losing a key ally with the fall of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, whose country had served as a conduit for Iran to send arms."}

In addition, he will retain a monopoly on the selection of candidates for the party’s electoral list, personally choose ministers in any potential government and appoint members of his party to Knesset committees.\nBennett, who led the now-defunct right-wing Yamina party, has been out of office since the 2022 collapse of his diverse coalition government, which in 2021 ousted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the premiership after 12 consecutive years, and following a period of political turmoil that saw four national elections held in three years.\nBennett’s government fell apart following the defection of multiple Knesset members from his party, starting with coalition whip Idit Silman in April 2022, whose departure deprived the coalition of its majority. She was soon followed by fellow MKs Amichai Chikli and Nir Orbach.

The targets included rocket launchers, cells of operatives, and buildings used by terror groups to plan attacks on forces, the military said.\nGround troops also killed several operatives and destroyed Hamas infrastructure in both northern and southern Gaza, the IDF added.\nAccording to the military, fundraiser Jasser Hussein Ali Shamieh “was responsible for the transfer of tens of millions of dollars to Hamas’s military wing.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“These funds were used to build up the force of the military wing, pay Hamas terrorist salaries and fund the terror organization,” the IDF said, adding that the money also “enabled the continuation of fighting and the sustainability of Hamas’s brigades in northern Gaza.”\nShamieh himself previously served as a battalion commander in Hamas’s Gaza City Brigade, the military said.\nIn recent days, the IDF has been gearing up for a planned major offensive in the Gaza Strip, which officials said would be launched if no hostage deal is reached with Hamas by the end of US President Donald Trump’s visit to the region on Friday.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHamas said in a statement that Israel was making a “desperate attempt to negotiate under the cover of fire” as indirect ceasefire talks continue through Trump envoys and Qatari and Egyptian mediators in Doha, Reuters reported.\nSmoke rises following an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip, as seen from southern Israel, Thursday, May 15, 2025.

Wherever we go, we face attacks. Death surrounds us everywhere.”\nThe war in Gaza began with the Hamas assault on October 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed southern Israel to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages.\nSmoke rises from an Israeli airstrike in Jabalia, northern Gaza Strip, Thursday, May 15, 2025.

The IDF has since bombed the area several times, in an apparent attempt to prevent anyone from approaching the tunnel beneath the medical center. The IDF has not yet confirmed whether Sinwar, the younger brother of former Hamas leader and October 7 terror mastermind Yahya Sinwar, was killed in the strike.\nOver 52,000 people have been killed in the Strip since the start of the war, according to the Hamas health ministry’s unverifiable tally."}

In the clip, Ayala Ben Gvir, who was filming the entire incident on her smartphone, could be seen attempting to slap a protester.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAt one point, police attempted to get Ben Gvir back into his car before the minister slipped past them, running and waving his arms at demonstrators.\nAccording to Ben Gvir’s spokesperson, the extremists screamed anti-enlistment slogans and tried to attack the minister, whom they called a “Zionist” and “murderer,” while Ayala Ben Gvir was “violently attacked by a Neturei Karta activist who slapped her” — prompting the minister to pledge that “the police will enforce the law here too.”\n“Ayala defended herself and slapped her back,” the spokesman stated, adding that police used “stun grenades, batons and other means to take control of the extremist Neturei Karta who were waving PLO flags.”\nBen Gvir’s office called on police to track down and arrest his wife’s alleged attacker.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn a clip he recorded at the scene, Ben Gvir insisted that it was a “shame and a disgrace” that such flags are painted on walls in an Israeli neighborhood and pledged that Beit Shemesh will not become an “extraterritorial” domain outside the bounds of the law.\nAdditional videos shared by Ben Gvir’s office showed police clapping and residents jeering as the offending graffiti was painted over.\n“The Israel Police will continue to work to arrest and bring to justice anyone who disrupts public order, causes property damage and acts violently toward public servants and law enforcement officials,” police said in a statement.\nThe city of Beit Shemesh, 19 miles west of Jerusalem, has long been known as a religious flashpoint. It rose to national prominence in 2011 when local extremists began harassing and spitting on young national-religious girls attending a school on territory they claimed belonged to the Haredi community.\nIn April 2018, then-deputy education minister Meir Porush’s car was mobbed in Ramat Beit Shemesh Bet. That same year, a soldier driving through the city crashed into a lamppost after his car was pelted with stones and trash.\nWhile the violence has abated in recent years, it has not disappeared, with extremists recently seeking to forcibly impose their way of life on residents of the city by posting modesty signs, tearing down Israeli flags and burning down a cellphone store.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn August 2023, dozens of extremists rioted outside a local school while then-mayor Aliza Bloch was touring the building. The rioters hurled objects, started a fire and vandalized her car — effectively holding her hostage for nearly two hours until she was rescued by police.\nIn March this year, extremists attacked Mayor Shmuel Greenberg, a member of the Haredi Degel Hatorah party, and his family outside a family celebration.\nOne video from the scene showed black-clad Hasidic Jews rocking the mayor’s car back and forth while another showed the mayor, wearing a helmet, being rushed out of a building by armored police as a baying mob chased him amid shouts of “Nazi.” He was then placed in another car and rushed from the scene.\n“The violent events that occurred today in Ramat Beit Shemesh, in which National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and his wife were attacked, once again reveal the complex and daily reality that the Beit Shemesh Municipality and the city’s residents are dealing with,” the city said in a statement.\n“These PLO flags were sprayed in the past 24 hours, after the previous ones were removed, at which time the team carrying out the removal was attacked,” it said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAddressing Ben Gvir, it added: “We welcome the fact that you are coming to see the reality on the ground, but remember: removing graffiti is only a response. The real solution lies in the state treating the root of the problem, through determined enforcement and dealing with extremist elements.”\nJTA contributed to this report."}

I’m sorry for any antisemitism you have experienced,” he said. “I’m sorry for my mistaken assumption that widespread antisemitism could never happen again in a modern, sophisticated, educated society and certainly not in New York City.”\nThe speech, one of several appearances Cuomo has made at New York City synagogues in recent weeks, came as Cuomo vies for Jewish votes ahead of the city’s mayoral primary on June 24. Polls show Cuomo is leading a crowded field in the primary, which will likely decide the winner of November’s general election in the mostly Democratic city.\nJewish issues have played a significant role in the campaign given the way news about Israel and Gaza has dominated headlines and activist spaces over the past year-plus, and due to the host of issues at play for Jews, such as hate crimes, street protests and yeshivas.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nCuomo has made combating antisemitism and support for the Jewish community a focus of his campaign, an effort he said was motivated by his longtime connections to the community, and the politics of the moment.\n“The Jewish community is important to me first on a personal level,” Cuomo told The Times of Israel in a Wednesday interview. “They are literally members of my family, they’re an important part of New York and they are under stress right now with the scourge of antisemitism.”\nCuomo framed the vote as a choice between the mainstream Democratic Party and the far-left Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Cuomo’s leading challenger, State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, is a DSA member who has alarmed Jews with his harsh rhetoric against Israel, such as his criticism of Israel the day after the October 2023 Hamas invasion. The New York branch of the DSA backed a widely criticized anti-Israel rally in Times Square the same day, and boycotting Israel is one of the party’s central planks.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNew York Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani participates in a District Council 37 New York City mayoral forum, February 26, 2025, in New York. (AP/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)\nNew York’s Democratic party leadership, including Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul, have remained staunchly supportive of Israel and the Jewish community. Adams, who shares a centrist base with Cuomo and has long ties to Jewish communities, is running as an independent for his reelection campaign.\n“You have a schism in the Democratic party right now and this election is in many ways a litmus test of that,” Cuomo said.\n“I don’t consider them Democrats, I consider them socialists,” Cuomo said of the DSA. “They support BDS, they pledge never to visit Israel. That’s not what I believe is the fundamental relationship between Israel and the Democratic party. As a Democrat, I think it’s synonymous that you support Israel.”\n“My position is 100% supportive of Israel and it’s a more right issue now because you do have two camps within the Democratic party,” he said.\nLast year’s primary for New York’s 16th Congressional District covering Westchester County and a sliver of the Bronx was similarly seen as a referendum between the two Democratic party camps. That race pitted centrist pro-Israel George Latimer against Jamaal Bowman, a progressive critic of Israel who repeatedly attacked the pro-Israel lobby during his campaign. Latimer won the vote in a stinging defeat for the progressive anti-Israel camp.\nSome of the same players are involved in the city’s mayoral race. Bowman criticized Cuomo during an endorsement of Mamdani this week, and a campaign that rallied Jewish constituents for the Westchester race led to a drive focused on the mayoral primary. In both races, organizers told Jewish voters, “Antisemitism is on the ballot.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo, center, joins other participants as they take part in the Celebrate Israel Parade, June 2, 2019, in New York. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle)\nJews are targeted in hate crimes more than all other groups combined in New York City, accounting for 62% of all bias incidents reported to police in the first quarter of 2025, according to the mayor’s office. Jews make up around 10% of the city population.\n“I’m just astonished and saddened and sickened by where we are, not just what is happening with these incidents, but the lack of outrage by elected officials,” Cuomo said. “I would’ve never imagined this was possible and I want to fight it with everything I can.”\nIn addition to speaking at synagogues, Cuomo has met with Jewish community leaders and outlined his plans for combating antisemitism. Those plans include codifying the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s working definition of antisemitism, which covers some forms of Israel criticism, into the city’s Human Rights Law; proposing a city masking law to combat antisemitic crimes; and introducing school curriculum on antisemitism and New York’s Jewish history.\nCodifying the IHRA definition will allow for enforcement against anti-Jewish discrimination, Cuomo said.\nSince the start of the Gaza war, hundreds of anti-Israel protests that feature eliminationist rhetoric toward Israel, support for terrorism, property destruction and antisemitism have unnerved Jewish New Yorkers.\nA man in a Hamas headband at an anti-Israel protest in New York City, January 6, 2025.

I will enforce the law,” he said.\nCuomo has a long record of supporting Israel and the Jewish community as governor to lean on in his campaign, such as passing an anti-BDS bill in 2016, his many visits to Israel, support for business ties between Israel and New York, and legislation aimed at combating antisemitism, including a 2020 bill named for the victim of an antisemitic murder in Monsey, New York. Cuomo was governor from 2011 to 2021, when he resigned amid sexual harassment allegations.\nThe city is home to an array of Jewish communities, from secular leftists to conservative Orthodox, and political leanings on Israel, antisemitism and other domestic issues vary between different Jewish communities. Cuomo drew the ire of many in the Orthodox and Hasidic communities for his role imposing restrictions on gatherings during the COVID pandemic while he was governor.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCuomo said he has been having conversations with the Hasidic and Orthodox communities about that controversy. This week, he met with Agudath Israel of America, an ultra-Orthodox umbrella group that sued him over the restrictions in 2020.\nCuomo said that he had been advised to keep restrictions in place due to a virus mutation.\n“In retrospect, you can argue that the virus didn’t mutate and we could’ve lifted restrictions sooner,” he told The Times of Israel. “I did err on the side of caution because the alternative was apocalyptic. We discussed that issue and I think we resolved that.”\nOrthodox communities tend to be more conservative, but many members in New York are registered Democrats who can vote in the upcoming primary.\nNew York City Comptroller Brad Lander at a press briefing in Manhattan, May 13, 2025. (Luke Tress/Times of Israel)\nCuomo has taken fire for his campaign from critics such New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, the city’s highest-ranking Jewish elected official and another primary candidate. Lander defines himself as a progressive Zionist and places around third in polls. New York City uses a ranked-choice voting system that complicates predictions about the election outcome.\nAfter Cuomo criticized Lander in a speech at the West Side Institutional Synagogue last month, Lander cursed Cuomo in Yiddish and attacked his record on Jewish issues. Weeks later, Lander responded in a speech at the same location, saying that Cuomo was weaponizing antisemitism for political points, and that using antisemitism as a political wedge was dangerous for Jews.\n“He stood up in this synagogue and called all his opponents – including the highest-ranking Jewish official in New York City – antisemitic, with absolutely zero basis. Why? Not to help us. To help himself,” Lander said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDespite some tensions, Cuomo’s message has found an audience with many Jewish New Yorkers.\nAt the speech on Saturday, congregants filled the pews, stood along the walls, and applauded throughout as Cuomo spoke out against BDS and equated anti-Zionism with antisemitism.\nAfter Cuomo left the stage, a crowd clustered around him. A mother introduced him to her children, an adolescent boy asked him for advice about getting into politics and an elderly man said, “You’re our best hope.”"}

We built entire advocacy strategies on the premise that if people just knew the truth—if they only understood the history, the context, the undeniable facts—they would change their minds.\nThis strategy isn’t just failing—it’s becoming obsolete.\nWe live in a post-truth era. In this cultural landscape, how people feel determines what they’re willing to believe, not the other way around. Emotional resonance precedes intellectual openness. And yet, the Jewish community continues to bring historical archives to a psychological battlefield.\nEven when we acknowledge this intellectually—saying things like “you can’t bring logic to a feeling fight”—in practice, we fall back on the familiar. We produce fact sheets, documentaries, timelines, and statistics. And when those efforts don’t move hearts, we stand stunned, asking: How can anyone support Hamas, knowing what they know?\nBut the brutal reality is—they don’t support Hamas because of what they know. They support Hamas because of what they feel.\nThis is not a rational battlefield. It’s an emotional one. And we are fighting it with the wrong weapons.\nWhy Is Emotion So Difficult for Us to Lead With?\nThe answer is buried in our collective trauma.\nFor centuries, vulnerability was a liability we could not afford. To survive, Jews learned to suppress emotion, lead with reason, and mask their fears behind strength. This was not weakness—it was adaptation. A survival strategy forged in the fires of persecution.\nBut survival strategies often become outdated long after the threat has passed. And while our intellectual sharpness has carried us far, it now works against us when emotional attunement is required.\nTrauma doesn’t just leave emotional scars—it calcifies entire communication styles. It tells us that to cry is to crumble, that to admit pain is to invite danger. So we speak through the safer language of intellect. We try to prove our pain rather than express it.\nBut you cannot persuade someone to care about your suffering through evidence alone. You must let them feel it.\nLet them hear the break in your voice. Let them see the grief in your eyes. Let them feel the heartbreak, not as a distant historical event, but as a present and living wound.\nThis is what moves people. This is what breaks the trance of propaganda.\nAnd yet, my research found that Israelis, speaking from a place of national trauma, are widely perceived by Americans as “cold,” “entitled,” and “uncaring.” This is the tragedy of trauma: it suppresses vulnerability, robs communication of warmth, and makes emotional resonance nearly impossible.\nWe cannot hope to be seen as fully human if we refuse to show our humanity.\nBlindspot #2: Confusing Activism with Catharsis\nThe second blindspot is even more insidious because it masquerades as strength: the conflation of activism with catharsis.\nTrauma demands emotional release. And understandably, when we’re overwhelmed by fear, pain, and rage, we want to do something—anything—to discharge that unbearable energy.\nBut too much of what we call activism today is really an internal release valve. We correct. We scold. We shame. We deliver monologues of moral outrage that feel powerful in the moment—but do little to create connection or change minds.\nThis is not activism. This is emotional self-soothing.\nWhy do we choose this path? Because outrage is easier than grief. Indignation feels powerful. Grief feels helpless. And catharsis lets us avoid the terrifying vulnerability of actually feeling our pain.\nBut here’s the hard truth: what feels good to express is often the least effective at creating change.\nIf we’re honest, much of our advocacy is designed to make us feel morally superior rather than strategically effective. We aim to win the argument instead of winning hearts.\nBut persuasion isn’t about proving how right we are—it’s about helping others see themselves in us.\nEffective Activism Is Audience-Centered, Not Advocate-Centered\nTrue activism asks a much harder question:\nWho is the audience? \nWhat do they fear? What do they long for? \nWhat emotional language do they speak? \nIf you don’t know the emotional ecosystem of your audience, you can’t meet them where they are. And if you can’t meet them where they are, they will never follow you to where you want them to go.\nWe speak in a language rich with meaning to us—words like antisemitism and Zionism—and expect others to feel their weight. But most Americans don’t. These words sound abstract, political, even alien.\nSo why not translate?\nInstead of antisemitism, talk about exclusion, fear, and erasure. \nInstead of Zionism, talk about belonging, safety, and continuity. \nThese words tap into universal human experiences. They evoke the emotional landscapes that Americans already understand—the fear of being excluded, the yearning for belonging, the instinct to protect what is ours.\nEven our slogans reveal this misalignment. Stand with Israel sounds tribal and transactional. Free Palestine feels urgent, emotional, and rooted in America’s own revolutionary identity.\nPro-Palestinian activists have mastered emotional strategy. When America grapples with its legacy of racism, they cast themselves as brown victims versus white oppressors. When distrust of power rises, they become rebels against the system. They don’t just tell their story—they tailor it to the emotional currents already swirling in the culture.\nAnd because they meet America where it is, they are heard.\nThe Courage to Do What Actually Works\nThe most effective strategies rarely offer the immediate emotional gratification that trauma-trained instincts crave. Real progress is slow. It rustles before it roars.\nIt sounds like this:\n“I still don’t like what Israel is doing, but I guess it’s more complicated than I thought.” \n“I didn’t realize Israelis struggle with these things too.” \n“It’s not really about all Israelis—it’s their government I have a problem with.” \nFor those who have spent years immersed in advocacy, these concessions may feel hollow. But they are not. They are the cracks where light begins to enter.\nWe must learn to measure success not by the thunder of applause or the satisfaction of “winning” the argument, but by the quiet shift in perception.\nThat small moment when someone pauses, hesitates, and begins to see Israelis not as a symbol, but as a people.\nConclusion: Tikkun Olam Begins with Tikkun Atzmi\nThe greatest obstacle to more effective pro-Israel advocacy is not public ignorance. It’s our own resistance to vulnerability.\nThe most effective antidotes to anti-Zionist propaganda require a kind of emotional attunement that the Jewish community, for all its strength and resilience, has long struggled to access.\nThat struggle is not a failure of conviction. It is the heartbreaking legacy of trauma.\nBut if we are truly committed to Tikkun Olam—the repair of the world—we must first embrace Tikkun Atzmi: the repair of ourselves.\nThis is the hardest work. It asks us to sit with our discomfort. To risk being misunderstood. To soften the armor forged in the fires of our history and let ourselves be seen—not as a cause or a case to defend, but as human beings carrying grief, hope, and a longing for connection.\nAnd in the end, that may be the most powerful form of activism there is.\n—\nThe full report can be found at AttuneNow.org"}

Birds are singing, and sunlight streams through the window, casting long shadows on the building across the street, just like a scene in an Edward Hopper painting. The days are getting longer now. It stays light well past 8 p.m., longer than it ever did in California, where I lived for twenty-five years.\nLast week, on May 8, Victory Day in Europe was celebrated in France with a grand ceremony on the Champs-Élysées. The television showed motorcycle parades, military officials on horseback wearing golden helmets, and President Emmanuel Macron in attendance. I had seen him here in Le Havre last September for the commemoration of the city’s Liberation Day in 1944.\nYesterday evening, on my way to the beach, I came across one of the Stolpersteine, the small brass memorial plaques created by German artist Günter Demnig to commemorate persons persecuted and murdered by the Nazi regime. This plaque was one of twelve placed in Le Havre in 2022. It pays tribute to David Fourmann, born in Paris in 1913 to Ukrainian-Russian Jewish immigrants. He was arrested in Le Havre on February 26, 1942, just three days after a Resistance attack on German soldiers. His arrest was part of a retaliatory roundup by the Nazi occupation forces. Civilians were taken hostage in response to the attack, with execution threats intended to prevent further Resistance.\nFourmann was imprisoned in Rouen, then transferred through Compiègne, Drancy, and Beaune-la-Rolande. On July 18, 1943, he was deported to Auschwitz II–Birkenau on Convoy No. 57 and registered as prisoner No. 130586. Later, he was sent to Jaworzno, a subcamp of Auschwitz, where prisoners were forced to work in coal mines under harsh conditions. He died there on January 1, 1944, according to the testimony of a fellow prisoner and friend, Simon Fdida. Fourmann’s name appears on the Wall of Names at the Shoah Memorial in Paris, as well as memorials in Le Havre and at the Beaune-la-Rolande camp. Just a few days ago, I had photographed Simon Fdida’s Stolperstein without knowing about their connection. Fdida survived and was liberated by the Red Army. The plaques commemorating these two men are placed just fifteen minutes apart, on the same street, but on opposite sides.\nThere is often an emphasis on heroism, victory, resistance, and liberation when discussing World War II ceremonies, as if everything ended definitively through military action. The reality is more complex. For many of us who inherited the World War II trauma, true victory and liberation never fully arrived.\nThis is perhaps why the words of Pope Francis and Pope Leo XIV are so soothing. Although I am not Catholic or religious, their language offers an alternative grounded in peace and the refusal to justify violence as a response to violence.\nI have turned inward, trying to understand why I feel so strongly about all this. Perhaps it is because I sense the bombs as if they were dropping on me. This is why St. Joseph’s Church in Le Havre has come to feel like a place of healing. The church was rebuilt by Auguste Perret and stands as a landmark to remember the loss of human lives during the bombing. I recently sat there, looking up at its 107-meter tower, built on a square in the shape of a Greek cross. Light filtered through Marguerite Huré’s stained-glass windows in shades of pink, gold, orange, blue, and green. Solemn music played, and tears came to my eyes.\nThe death of innocent civilians is always a tragedy, regardless of nationality, religious background, or ability. Even the deaths of soldiers who are forced, coerced, or pressured by political leaders who live in comfort and safety feel morally troubling. This is why the church moves me so deeply. It stands like a lighthouse, visible from many places in the city. At the same time, I thought about the victims of the Nazi Aktion T4 program, who were not officially recognized as victims of National Socialism until January 29, 2025. Can you imagine? It took eighty years and the efforts of many people, including the German organization Lebenshilfe, to achieve that recognition. I feel such a deep sense of injustice.\nThe path to the atrocities of the Nazi regime began with a mixture of eugenics, the instability of the Weimar Republic, and the blame placed on Germany for World War I in Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles. Economic hardship and national humiliation fueled extremism and the rise of National Socialism.\nMother’s Day had just passed. This year, it was celebrated last Sunday, May 11, in the United States and Germany; on March 30 in the United Kingdom; and it will be celebrated on May 25 in France. As an international person who has worked and lived in each of these countries, it can be a bit of a juggle to keep up with the different dates. Honestly, for me, every day is Mother’s Day. I don’t care about official days, but let my heart guide me. If it says give her flowers today, even if it’s not Mother’s Day, I will do so anyway. Most often, the flowers are fresher.\nI’m not a mother myself in a world that glorifies motherhood. Well, what can I say? Yet I did spend time thinking about my mother in the context of World War II. She was born in 1940, a refugee child living in poverty, in inadequate housing, without proper nutrition. Her lifelong insomnia may have come from the maternal stress during my grandmother’s pregnancy and her early childhood experiences during World War II—experiences that, at the time, received little attention. Today, refugee children in Germany receive all sorts of support, including horseback riding lessons.\nShe later became the mother of three children in postwar Germany, including my younger brother, who suffered from multiple disabilities and a type of epilepsy that could not be controlled with medication. The cause of his condition was never clarified. He died at the age of 32 in a country that had once declared people like him unworthy of life. My mother raised him in a society where former Nazi doctors such as Werner Heyde, Kurt Borm, and Werner Catel continued to hold positions of power. Where then is the liberation? Where is the victory?\nDeep in thought, I tried to picture Le Havre in 1940 when German forces occupied the city. That was the same year my mother was born, right after my grandparents had to leave Hoffnungsthal, a small village near Odessa, in today’s Ukraine. I have those parallel scenes in my mind. I see them taking off, my grandmother highly pregnant, she being born in a hospital in Romania on this long journey on horses and wagons, while in a different part in the world, there is Le Havre, a strategic naval base and part of the Atlantic Wall. German troops built bunkers, machine gun nests, and anti-aircraft batteries and took control of key locations, including Fort de Sainte-Adresse. I also see the 300 Jews who used to live here in the district around the Notre Dame Cathedral still visiting their original synagogue. Some may have received letters from loved ones in America who were able to leave on the cruise ship Normandie to New York City, while Fdida and Fourmann were captured and deported. Does everyone see things so vividly as I do, I wonder?\nAt the same time, I see my father’s family in Berlin. There is his mother, my Oma Greta, whom I have never met, who attempted suicide and was taken away by her own mother, and nobody knows what happened to her then. I picture her in her apartment, trying to cut her veins with my dad and his brother, as small children witnessing her. He was raised by his grandparents in Berlin-Köpenick, experiencing the bombings by the Royal Air Force in Berlin. His grandpa was a physically impaired World War I veteran. His life was also shaped by Berlin-Köpenick coming under Soviet influence, escaping to the West before the wall was built, the one that separated him from the people who raised him.\nThen there is Operation Astonia, the assault by the British 1st Corps to retake Le Havre in 1944, which resulted in the near destruction of the city. About 80 percent was reduced to rubble, thousands of civilians were killed, and hundreds of ships were sunk. I try to picture the German soldiers being treated in the bomb-resistant underground medical facility, and how the British officer and playwright William Douglas-Home was imprisoned for refusing to participate in the bombing because French civilians were not evacuated properly beforehand.\nAt the same time, I see the grey buses picking up people deemed unworthy of life, taken daily to Germany’s six killing centers to be gassed, some begging the nurses, not wanting to board the bus. Then, the sermon by Bishop Clemens von Galen to stop it.\nMy mind suddenly drifts to the Wannsee House in Berlin. I picture the high-ranking Nazi officials, including Adolf Eichmann, meeting there on January 20, 1942, to plan the Final Solution and discuss Operation Reinhard. In my imagination, they briefly decide which personnel from Aktion T4 will be sent to Poland. All of this history feels very close to me—I see it like a film.\nOh my gosh, it is already afternoon. The sun has shifted, and I am still sitting here. I have not eaten anything yet.\nBefore heading out, I look again at my brother’s medical records from the epilepsy center in Kork-Kehl, where he was first treated. Not long ago, I learned that a total of 133 people were sent from there to the killing centers.\nI reread a letter from one doctor to another in the year 1982. It mentions Luminal, a medication that was used to overdose some of the euthanasia victims. I examine the dosage. It looks small, and then I reread what happened to my brother afterward. About three months later, he had a status epilepticus, a life-threatening condition. I remember those days, my mother sleeping with him in the hospital, doctors predicting he would not survive puberty, and a math teacher telling me I had too much self-pity when I sat in the classroom with tears in my eyes. I used to put my feelings into my piano playing. Now I don’t have a piano anymore.\nThe records I received only go up to 1983, although my brother lived for two more decades. Although the doctors seemed to be very careful in their experimentation with different medications and doses, what strikes me is the language used in those files. I stumbled upon the words unclear etiology and eugenics.\nI go over the passage of a letter again where one doctor urges my parents to institutionalize my brother, and recall our hesitation. Another letter describes my mother as overly protective, dismissively labeling her as decompensated, and how the entire family fell apart because of my brother’s condition. Not a single word about getting us horseback riding lessons, creative writing courses, art therapy, or verbal self-defense courses.\nOn my way to the supermarket, passing Rue Victor Hugo where the new synagogue stands, I see St. Joseph’s Church reaching into the sky like the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty, and I think—buildings can be rebuilt, but their true value comes from the lives lived around and inside them, while humans simply cannot be replaced.\nInside St. Joseph Church in Le Havre, France.

By this I mean trying to teach the rest of the world about the Holocaust. This is a realization I came to after October 7, but I couldn’t figure out how to express it until Ayaan Hirsi Ali did it for me in this interview:\nI want to draw attention to two points she makes in the interview. Number one, and the biggest, is that everything which enables Islamic militants and specifically Islamic antisemitism in the West is a direct reaction to the Holocaust by those thinking they’re preventing a future one. The second is that the worst thing Jews can do – and the thing we’ve been doing for the last 80 years – is to try to get the rest of the world to recognize us as victims.\nTo understand Ms. Ali, you have to know that she suffered female genital mutilation as a child in the Muslim culture Somalia. You also have to know that while this practice is not officially part of Islam, it is common to all Muslim cultures. Yet, as she describes in the video, when she would try to warn her adopted country about the dangers of the Muslim immigrants’ culture – her native culture – it was specifically the Jewish mayor of Amsterdam who would point at her accusingly and say “be careful about not repeating history.”\nThe problem with Holocaust education is not that it didn’t work; it’s that it did. Everyone, especially in Europe, has become afraid that a minority group will be persecuted or that it will be denied entry at a moment of need or that it will be forced to assimilate in order to survive. They’ve solved these “issues”: Everyone from the Middle East and Africa is allowed in and there is no pressure at all to conform to Western values or norms.\nIn an effort to create a new morality to reach these aims they used the lesson we Jews taught them, the Western non-Jews, that the problem of the Holocaust was that the Jews were oppressed. If one wants to be righteous, all you have to do is stand up for the oppressed, the victims. What we didn’t see happening was that in the intervening 80 years, we became white and oppressors and the Muslims out-victimed us, at least in their propaganda.\nNone of this considers at all the meritoriousness of the “oppressed” or “victim”. If you shoot someone trying to kill you, you’re alive and he’s dead, and therefore he’s the victim and you’re the oppressor. This is a fight we can’t win. In that fight, only numbers matter and we can’t produce enough dead Jews. But this is the lesson we taught them, “remember the 6 million”. And because of that, someone like Macron of France can come to Israel, visit Yad Vashem and return home to announce recognition of a Palestinian state with a clear conscience.\nWhat should we have done? Or, at least, what should we do? We need to make the Holocaust like Passover.\nThe seder is a time when we tell our story to ourselves. Despite what is done today, this is really the last observance that would be appropriate to a non-Jewish guest. When there’s a Paschal sacrifice – G-d willing soon – non-Jews couldn’t participate if they wanted to. Even during today’s celebrations, this is the time when we tell G-d to “Pour out your wrath on the nations who do not know you.” We don’t worry about the world’s reaction because this is about “Tell YOUR son…”\nYom Hashoah, Tisha B’Av and Yom Hazikaron are incredibly important. WE need to remember. We need to remember the massacre at York in England. We need to remember the Ukrainian (Cossack) massacre of “Tach veTat”. We need to remember the Hebron massacre of 1929. We need to remember the Holocaust. We need to remember the Simchat Torah massacre of 2023. We need to remember the fallen of our country. We need to remember the destruction of the Temple. Allies are great, but they will come and go. We need to work on us."}

An encampment had settled for nearly two weeks into the center of campus, its chants and signage echoing a narrow and often exclusionary narrative about Israel and Zionism. Many Jewish students felt unsafe and unwelcome on their way to study in the library for finals. There were threats of protests during graduation, and many of our students debated whether to even attend. Fear, confusion, and isolation were all too present.\nWhat a difference a year makes.\nThis year at the University of Vermont, the campus once again engaged in questions of Israel and Palestine — but this time through dialogue, scholarship, and academic inquiry. Rather than shouting past one another, students and faculty came together to think deeply, listen curiously, and ask hard questions. Instead of protests designed to silence, we saw programs designed to expand understanding. Instead of posting statements online, we listened, we convened, we learned, and we adapted.\nThe university hosted a symposium on Israel/Palestine this fall after a listening session last year where students said they wanted a chance to intellectually engage with these serious issues. It was an ambitious and important initiative rooted in history, nuance, and learning and the first of its kind at UVM. While it hit the mark in some respects and missed it in others, the important thing to note is that this university was trying and it was doing so publicly. Renowned Harvard historian Derrick Penslar spoke about Zionism not as a monolithic idea, but as an evolving idea shaped by the Jewish people’s search for safety, self-determination, and moral responsibility. Earlier this spring Peter Beinart met with students to discuss “Life After Gaza,” engaging in a thoughtful conversation about the human cost of war, the future of the region, and the weight of hope. Students of differing ideologies met, talked, and engaged in a conversation that was open and honest and would have been nearly impossible under the polemic debates of last year.\nThese events didn’t ignore the pain or the politics; they embraced them. They modeled what it looks like when a university lives up to its promise: to teach, to challenge, and to care by providing access to opportunities to learn. While it may have been federally compelled through the Title VI investigation and resolution, UVM was acting to improve campus climate by upholding their policies to prohibit antisemitism, anti-Arab, and anti-Asian bias and harrassment.\nWe at UVM Hillel have seen the shift firsthand. Jewish student participation has grown significantly from last year’s lows to more than 1,500 meaningful student interactions this year. Students are hungry for spaces where they can be both intellectually curious and spiritually grounded where they can celebrate Shabbat with friends one night and study ancient Jewish texts on protest, God, and artificial intelligence the next, all while sharing good Vermont food together.\nThis past year, our team took bold steps to meet students where they are: off-campus dinners with Hillel Fresh, on-campus celebrations from Purim to Pride, Skinny Pancake Shabbat, Camel’s Hump hikes, and new Jewish learning fellowships that foster conversation rather than confrontation. These aren’t just programs. They’re invitations to belong and engage.\nThis weekend, when UVM students walk across the stage at graduation, many will be proudly wearing blue and white cords from Hillel — a symbol of their Jewish identity, resilience, and connection to one another. There are no calls to hide, no whispers of fear. There is pride. There is joy. There is community.\nWe also introduced a new honor this year: the Patricia A. Prelock Ally to the Jewish People Award, named for UVM’s outgoing interim President, a steadfast partner who has consistently shown up for Jewish students with empathy, courage, and action. This award recognizes university leaders who listen, who learn, and who lead with integrity. It’s a reminder that allyship isn’t performative, it’s personal and it makes a difference.\nThere is still so much work to be done. The forces that seek to divide us remain real and recalibrating. But this year proved something powerful: that change is possible. That healing can happen. That dialogue can replace dismissal, and scholarship can replace slogans on our campus.\nLooking ahead, I hope UVM continues to lead not only in addressing antisemitism, but in uplifting all marginalized communities through compassion, education, and accountability through policy. I hope we keep building spaces where complexity is welcomed, and where no student has to choose between who they are and where they learn.\nA year ago, we were bracing for impact. Today, we are building momentum.\nWhat a difference a year makes."}

The world feels like it’s not turning quite right. The alliances that shaped the postwar order are fraying. The Middle East is reshuffling itself in real time. Here in the US, civic trust is eroding, cultural discourse is unrecognizable, and many Jews are waking up afraid.\nThis is not just a political crisis; it’s a Jewish one. We wonder: Will this country, long a safe haven for Jews, find its footing—or are we watching a soft, tortured empire imploding in real time? And what about Israel? Can it forge new alliances? Can it come together? Will it be safe?\nI don’t know. No one does. But here’s what I do know: Jews have never waited for stability to make meaning. We don’t need the world to figure itself out to claim our story. We absorb the damage, ritualize the memory, and move forward—on our own terms.\nWe don’t outsource Jewish identity. We don’t ask permission. We craft calendars.\nThis week’s Torah portion, Emor, lays out the architecture of Jewish sacred time: Shabbat, Pesach, Shavuot, Yom Kippur, Sukkot. Holidays that begin with divine command and end with human proclamation: “My appointed festivals… that you shall proclaim as set times” (Leviticus 23:2).\nAt first glance, they seem top-down. God commands the holiday and we obey. But looking closer, a deeper truth emerges: the Torah gives us the scaffolding, and we’re the ones who fill it in. In every generation, we have added memories, sorrows, and rebirths. The result isn’t just holy time—it’s Jewish time: a living record of what we carry and choose to elevate.\nRight now, we’re counting the Omer—the 49 days between Pesach and Shavuot. The Torah frames it as a journey from liberation to revelation, from Egypt to Sinai.\nBut over time, this period became more than spiritual preparation. It became a season of mourning. The Talmud tells us that 24,000 of Rabbi Akiva’s students died during these weeks because they didn’t treat one another with respect. So Jewish communities began to grieve: no weddings, no music, no haircuts, no celebration.\nThose restrictions lift on the 33rd day of the Omer—Lag BaOmer. According to tradition, it marks both the hilulah—the joyous anniversary of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai’s passing, a towering figure in Jewish mysticism—and the end of the plague that struck Rabbi Akiva’s students. Joy returns. Music plays. Bonfires roar.\nBut here’s what we often forget: none of this—the mourning, the customs, the holiday itself—is in the Torah. Even in the Talmud, the connections are tenuous. These rituals only solidified centuries later, especially in medieval Ashkenaz (the region of northern France and Germany) —after the Crusades decimated Jewish communities. Jews needed a container for their overwhelming grief.\nWhen I first traced these customs to their post-Talmudic origins, I thought I’d debunked something. I was in college and believed I’d found the “real” story.\nBut I was wrong.\nThe fact that these practices emerged later doesn’t weaken them—it reflects the awesome power we have to shape our story. That’s the genius of Judaism. Our traditions aren’t relics. They’re responses. Our Jewish calendar isn’t static—it’s evolving. We are tasked not just with living through history but with transforming it into Jewish memory.\nTake the story of Rabbi Akiva’s students. Some scholars suggest they were likely killed during the Bar Kochva revolt, which Rabbi Akiva supported. Rome crushed the rebellion—but the Talmud doesn’t blame Rome. It focuses on internal strife between the students. Why? Because Jews have never let empire be the main protagonist in our story. We turned military defeat into moral reflection—and made our ability to fight baseless hatred a task for generations.\nRabbi Daniel Sperber, the great scholar of Jewish custom, described how mourning for Rabbi Akiva’s students became layered with the grief of later generations. His writing transformed the mourning customs of the Omer for me into acts of deep solidarity: “Blood touched blood,” he wrote. “The blood of Rabbi Akiva’s disciples is mixed with the blood of the martyrs of Ashkenaz.”\nIn other words, our calendar rituals don’t just preserve history—they absorb it and reaffirm our values. What began as mourning for one tragedy became a container for Jews to continue making meaning.\nThat’s a deeply Jewish move. And we’re still making it today.\nWe didn’t let Rome own our story then. We’re not going to let Hamas, Qatar, or anyone acting against us own it now.\nThat’s what Jewish time does. It doesn’t just mark what happened. It insists on what matters. It draws moral meaning from destruction. It turns catastrophe into narrative, narrative into ritual, and ritual into continuity.\nSo when we count the Omer—when we keep its mourning customs, and when we set them down on Lag BaOmer—we’re not reenacting a quaint historical memory.

With a mission to establish a Nuremberg-style precedent against terrorism, O7J is led by Yael Vias Gvirsman, an experienced international criminal law attorney with over 20 years of prosecuting crimes against humanity. Yael Vias Gvirsman, an attorney-at-law at the Israeli Bar, has extensive experience in international law, having worked as a director at Radzyner Law School and an independent lawyer specializing in national litigation. She has also worked at international law departments at MFA, MOJ, UNHCR, Tel Aviv, and Jerusalem. Gvirsman is currently a PhD candidate in International Criminal Law and holds masters in French, English, and Hebrew. She has spoken at international conferences in Israel, South Africa, The Netherlands, The US, and Germany, focusing on the peace goal, the legitimacy of the International Criminal Court, and the role of the International Criminal Tribunal in establishing the narrative of genocide in Rwanda.\nThe primary mission of her organization, O7J, is to ensure that justice for the victims of the October 7 massacre transcends national boundaries. The organization aims to anchor the truth in legal procedures rather than social media narratives, providing a platform for victims to seek justice on an international scale. O7J is currently representing over 400 victims and plans to onboard an additional 400 into five civil lawsuits against states supporting terrorism, financial institutions enabling terror, and organizations like UNRWA.\nThe October 7 Atrocities Background.\nThe October 7 massacre was a devastating event that resulted in numerous casualties and left thousands of victims in its wake. Survivors of attacks on southern Israeli communities, bereaved families, and hostages with their families are among those seeking justice. The atrocities committed on this day have prompted a global response, with O7J at the forefront of legal actions to hold perpetrators accountable.\nYael Vias Gvirsman, the founder of O7J, brings a wealth of experience from her work in international tribunals in Rwanda, Sudan, and The Hague. Her expertise in prosecuting crimes against humanity is instrumental in guiding the organization’s efforts to pursue justice for the victims of the October 7 massacre. Vias Gvirsman’s commitment to this cause is both personal and professional, as she seeks to bring justice home to Israel.\n \nLegal Proceedings & International Legal Principles.\nOctober 7 Justice Without Borders (O7J) has initiated legal actions in various jurisdictions, including the International Criminal Court (ICC), Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Israel. The organization uses international legal principles like universal jurisdiction to prosecute crimes regardless of the location or the accused’s nationality. This allows O7J to bring cases forward in various countries, ensuring global accountability. The organization coordinates with global prosecutors to create a comprehensive legal response that matches the international nature of the crimes committed on October 7, 2023.\nO7J’s legal proceedings include criminal prosecutions before the ICC and national courts, civil litigation against states and corporate entities accused of funding or enabling Hamas, and gathering and preserving evidence of war crimes, including sexual violence and torture. Their approach is victim-centered, providing pro bono representation to survivors, hostages, and bereaved families.\nO7J’s multi-jurisdictional legal efforts utilize international legal principles like universal jurisdiction to pursue both criminal and civil cases worldwide, targeting individuals and entities responsible for or complicit in the October 7 atrocities.\nSurvivor Empowerment.\nPro Bono Representation & Restorative Justice.\nA fundamental pillar of O7J’s mission is providing pro bono legal representation to survivors and their families. By removing financial barriers, O7J ensures that victims of the October 7 atrocities have equitable access to expert legal support. This commitment empowers survivors to actively pursue justice and hold perpetrators accountable, regardless of their economic circumstances. O7J embraces a restorative justice approach, recognizing that the legal process serves more than just punitive purposes. Through legal proceedings, victims are given the opportunity to clearly distinguish right from wrong and have their rights formally acknowledged. This process helps provide emotional closure and validation, fostering healing by restoring dignity and recognizing the suffering endured. O7J believes that justice is a vital part of the recovery journey, offering survivors recognition and a renewed sense of empowerment.\nEvidence Gathering and Preservation.\nWar Crimes Documentation, ICC Involvement, Lawsuits Against UNRWA.\nOctober 7 Justice Without Borders (O7J) is deeply engaged in evidence gathering and preservation related to the October 7 atrocities, focusing on documenting war crimes such as extermination, torture, and sexual violence. This meticulous collection of evidence is vital for building strong legal cases to hold perpetrators accountable across multiple jurisdictions. A significant outcome of O7J’s efforts is the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) issuance of an arrest warrant for a senior Hamas commander, which explicitly cites evidence gathered by the organization. This highlights the crucial role that thorough documentation plays in enabling international legal institutions to pursue justice effectively. In addition to criminal prosecutions, O7J is actively pursuing civil litigation against entities such as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and financial institutions accused of indirectly enabling Hamas.\nThese lawsuits aim to hold organizations accountable for their complicity in facilitating terrorism and to secure reparations for victims. O7J’s multi-jurisdictional legal strategy leverages international legal principles, including universal jurisdiction, to ensure a global response to these crimes. Their work includes coordinating with prosecutors, preserving victim testimonies, and compiling visual and documentary evidence to support both criminal and civil proceedings O7J’s comprehensive approach to war crimes documentation, ICC collaboration, and civil litigation forms a robust framework to advance justice for victims of the October 7 atrocities and to hold all responsible parties accountable worldwide.\nChallenges &Strategies.\nFinancial Needs, Fundraising Efforts, Non-Political Stance.\nO7J faces significant legal challenges in its pursuit of justice, including jurisdictional complexities, evidence requirements, and accountability of diverse actors. To overcome these challenges, O7J employs multi-jurisdictional litigation, collaborations with international prosecutors, robust evidence gathering, and victim-centered representation. To continue its critical work, O7J urgently needs to raise $356,000, relying entirely on donations and philanthropic support. Contributions are tax-deductible under Section 501(c)(3) in the United States and Section 46A in Israel via Matan, Israel’s Association for Gifted Philanthropy. O7J maintains a strict non-political stance, focusing exclusively on providing legal representation to victims and building evidence-based cases. This ensures that the organization’s work remains dedicated to justice and accountability without political bias or influence.\nCase Studies: Shani Louk & Nira from Kibbutz Be’er cases.\nShani Nicole Louk was a 22-year-old German-Israeli tattoo artist and influencer who was killed during the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack at the Re’im music festival near the Gaza border. After her death, her desecrated body was paraded publicly by Hamas militants in Gaza, a harrowing image that became emblematic of the brutality of the attack. Her family, represented by October 7 Justice Without Borders (O7J), is working to ensure that Shani’s legacy is remembered for her artistry and spirit rather than the viral footage of her suffering.\nHer body was recovered by Israeli forces in May 2024 and buried in her hometown of Srigim, Israel, following a long period of uncertainty and mourning. Her family’s engagement with O7J underscores the organization’s commitment to dignified representation and justice for victims of atrocities.\nNira is a survivor from Kibbutz Be’eri who demonstrated remarkable courage during the October 7 attacks. While under siege, she directed Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops from a safe room in her home, helping coordinate defense efforts. After the attack, she personally identified victims, embodying resilience and strength. Nira’s case exemplifies the type of survivor empowerment and legal support O7J provides, highlighting the organization’s focus on representing individuals who have endured profound trauma and loss while actively contributing to their communities’ defense and recovery.\nGlobal Impact & Challenges.\nAntisemitism and Societal Trauma\nThe October 7 massacre has heightened antisemitism and caused significant societal trauma. The organization, O7J, seeks justice for victims, fosters community solidarity, and raises awareness about the human cost of terrorism and the importance of upholding human rights globally. O7J’s work is rooted in global cooperation, involving close collaboration with international prosecutors, legal experts, and institutions like the International Criminal Court (ICC). This partnership is crucial for building strong, multi-jurisdictional legal cases, pooling expertise and resources to effectively document and prosecute crimes against humanity, ensuring accountability in line with international legal standards, and promoting a unified global response to terrorism and mass atrocities. O7J’s comprehensive approach not only seeks justice through the courts but also contributes to healing fractured communities and strengthening international legal frameworks against impunity.\nO7J has the Moral Imperative of Justice Never to Stop.\nThe October 7 massacre has heightened antisemitism and caused significant societal trauma.

Before his demise, al‑Kikli had quietly built the Stabilization Support Apparatus into a state within a state, siphoning off oil revenues, running notorious detention centers, and granting safe passage to smugglers. His private militia thrived in the shadows of Libya’s fragmentation, crippling legitimate institutions and presenting a daily challenge to Western counterterrorism efforts. When he walked into that trap at the 444th Brigade’s headquarters, he believed he was negotiating power, not meeting his end. The gunfire that followed did not just kill a militia boss. It detonated a domino effect of realignment—one that propelled Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah’s loyal brigades into the heart of al‑Kikli’s territory, wresting control of prisons, oil checkpoints, and critical crossroads in a matter of days. \nThat swift consolidation has rewritten the rules. In the immediate aftermath, the detritus of al‑Kikli’s patronage networks collapsed under its own weight. Port operators who once paid extortionate “security fees” saw those demands vanish almost overnight. Prison wards notorious for torture and trafficking were reclaimed by the state. Outmanned and outgunned, the ragged remnants of the SSA melted away or were absorbed into official forces. Tripoli, in those fevered 48 hours, glimpsed what unified governance could achieve—an effective patrol of neighborhoods, an end to impromptu militia checkpoints, and a restoration of order that felt almost miraculous to residents who had grown numb to violence. \nFor US policy makers, the moment is electric. A cohesive Libyan National Army under Dbeibah’s command offers a partner far more reliable than the patchwork of militias chronicling between Ankara and Moscow for support. It means fewer gunmen at critical oil terminals, leaving Libya’s output—vital for global markets and American energy companies—far less vulnerable to blackmail or siege. It opens the door to a concerted counterterrorism partnership that could finally squeeze ISIS and al‑Qaeda cells hiding in Libya’s vast desert expanses. It signals the potential to dismantle trafficking rings that have turned human misery into profit and propelled countless migrants into perilous Mediterranean crossings—each thwarted voyage a direct win for European and American border security interests. \nYet this window will not stay open forever. Militia leaders are already regrouping, seeking new alliances and probing for weaknesses in the fragile unity of Tripoli’s defense. International actors like Turkey and Russia are eyeing the flux with opportunistic intent, ready to bankroll proxies if they smell an advantage. The United States must move with speed and clarity to cement the gains. That means surging specialized training and equipment to vetted units, not as a token gesture but as a tangible investment in Libya’s monopoly on force. It means embedding legal advisors and human rights monitors within Libya’s justice institutions to ensure a credible process of accountability for former militia commanders who abused power with impunity. It means dispatching a dedicated US envoy to weave together the strands of international support—linking Washington, Brussels, Cairo, and the UN in a unified strategy to bolster Dbeibah’s civilian-led government. \nThe payoff could be immense. Beyond preserving uninterrupted oil flows and bolstering Western leverage in the Mediterranean, a stable Libya under a recognized central authority would stand as a bulwark against extremist resurgence and a beacon for democratic reform across North Africa. The alternative is the familiar nightmare: a return to fragmented rule, intermittent blockades of oil ports, anarchy in Tripoli’s streets, and another wave of migrants making the perilous sea crossing. The ambush that felled al‑Kikli has rewritten Libya’s story. The question now is whether the United States will seize the pen or watch from the sidelines as old factions scramble to rewrite the ending. "}

Let me be clear: This is not diplomacy, it’s delusion. And it’s dangerous.\nThere is no justice in rewarding a society that danced in the streets while Jews were being butchered. To advocate for Palestinian statehood at this moment is to tell the world that terrorism works. It is not a roadmap to peace; it is a blueprint for more Jewish funerals.\nThere is no peace to be made with those who raised their children to cheer at the sight of Jewish blood. And there is no peace to be found in negotiating with leaders who have never accepted Israel’s right to exist.\nThe push amid this chaos is not a diplomatic breakthrough. It is a profound act of amnesia. The world has already forgotten that it was precisely this illusion of peace that led to the current nightmare. For years, Israel was told that concessions would bring calm. And what did it receive in return? Thousands of rockets and tunnels dug not for diplomacy, but for slaughter.\nWhat problem, exactly, would a two-state solution solve today?\nWould it stop Hamas from seeking Israel’s destruction?\nWould it turn Palestinian schoolbooks into tools of tolerance?\nWould it convince the international community to finally hold Palestinian leaders accountable?\nWould it resurrect the Jews butchered on October 7?\nOf course not.\nBecause the real problem isn’t borders, it’s indoctrination. It’s antisemitism so deeply woven into Palestinian education, media, and culture that it no longer even shocks; it’s expected. It’s the normalization of antisemitism in Palestinian society to such an extent that not a single Gazan has tried to free an Israeli hostage, not even for a reward. That silence is deafening. And it is incompatible with peace.\nIf your cause is wrapped in enough blood and broadcast widely enough, you’ll be handed a seat at the table. That the path to statehood runs through kindergartens soaked in Jewish blood and kibbutzim turned into killing fields. It’s not only morally wrong, it’s strategically suicidal.\nA sovereign Palestinian state today would not be a neighbor; it would be a frontline outpost for jihad, a launchpad for terror.\nA weapon pointed at the heart of Israel with international legitimacy stamped on the handle. It would embolden Iran. It would empower Hezbollah. And it would guarantee that the Jewish people, once again, will pay in blood for the world’s delusions.\nReal Friends Don’t Push Fantasy\nThere’s a reason people have stopped talking about a two-state solution. Not because they’ve moved rightward. But because they’ve woken up. And yet, in the safety of Western capitals and international conferences, the fantasy lives on. Pushed by people who will never have to shelter their children from rockets. Advocated by politicians who measure morality by media headlines. And endorsed by so-called “friends of Israel” who think that condemning Hamas isn’t enough, they must also rebuke Israel, lest they appear too tribal, too loyal, too Jewish.\nBut let me say it clearly: Real friends don’t pressure a nation to negotiate with monsters. Real friends don’t ask Israel to reward those who murder its children.\nIsrael Doesn’t Need Lectures. It Needs Allies.\nThis is not the time for philosophical debates about statehood. It is not the time to pretend that coexistence is possible while one side still chants “From the River to the Sea” and teaches its children that Jews are pigs and apes.\nThis is the time for moral clarity.\nThis is the time to defeat Hamas, not accommodate it.\nThis is the time to stand with Israel, not demand that it compromise with evil.\nIf the world wants to help, let it start by demanding the unconditional release of every hostage. Let it cut off funding to those who glorify terror. Let it stop making excuses for barbarism and start drawing red lines that actually mean something.\nBecause there will be no peace until Palestinian society undergoes a transformation so radical that it stops venerating death and starts cherishing life.\nNo peace until antisemitism is not their national curriculum, but a national disgrace. No peace until Jewish children can sleep through the night without the sound of air raid sirens.\nUntil then, the only responsible solution is no solution.\nNot now.\nNot soon.\nNot while hostages are held in dark tunnels and the world dares to speak of statehood. Not while Hamas still breathes and the Jewish people still bleed.\nNot until the last hostage is home. Alive. And free."}

To be clear, it was a machloket l’shem shamayim — it had to do with an enigmatic incident in Parashat Emor that has puzzled readers for centuries. And there we were, unable to agree on what the story was really about.\nThe tale of the first blasphemer occurs over seven pesukim in which the text introduces a nameless man it calls the “son whose mother was Israelite and whose father was Egyptian.” Later, the pesukim identify his mother as Shelomit bat Dibri. For a reason the text does not clearly state, the half-Israelite half-Egyptian man got into an argument with an Israelite man, and the former blasphemed — pronouncing God’s Name — and was put to death.\nDespite an abundance of scholarly commentary and context, questions about this text prevail. Why are there so many biographical details for this man who is not named? Why is his mother named when he is not? What were they arguing about? What justified the severity of his punishment? And — as per our in-transit debate this week — is this a story about communal failure to take responsibility, or is it designed to communicate that some crimes must be punished, even when there is ample justification for empathy?\nUltimately, as is true for many stories in Tanach, within the questions lies the theology. The mystery of this story is profound, but so is its meaning. \n***\nThe first blasphemer isn’t named.\nIt’s possible that he may not have been a fully-grown man — he is textually identified as בֶּן (ben, son), in contrast to the Israelite he fought, who is called an אִישׁ (ish, man). However, his lineage is named — he was the son of Shelomit bat Dibri of the tribe of Dan and an unnamed Egyptian. “The Torah did not bother to be specific and mention his name as it did not make any difference in the end,” Ohr HaChaim posited.\nOn the other hand, scholars are quick to point the finger at Shelomit bat Dibri. She is the only woman named in Vayikra, and many intuit the inclusion of her name as implying guilt or responsibility for the incident. Varying translations of her name reflect the rabbinic assumption that Shelomit bore some measure of culpability — with interpretations of her name suggesting promiscuity or gossip, implying that her conduct influenced her son’s behavior.\nThe argument between the two men, most commentators agree, hinged upon the son of Shelomit’s tribal identity. Rashi explains it in the following way: \nHe sought to pitch his tent in the camp of Dan. They said to him: ‘What leads you to pitch your tent in the camp of Dan?’ He said to them: ‘I am from one of the daughters of Dan.’ They said to him: ‘It is written: “Each man by his banner with the insignias of his patrilineal house” (Numbers 2:2) – and not his matrilineal house.’\nIn this version of events, we meet a man in tragic circumstances, barred by his birth from having a tribal affiliation. Some scholars add that he brought this case to Moshe in a judicial capacity, and Moshe concluded that he could not camp with the tribe of Dan, citing the word Vayetze (and he went out) to mean he exited the courthouse. \nHowever this story took place, the young man made an angry decision — he cursed God. Within the greater context of rejection and alienation, it becomes something we can understand a little better. After all, this is someone who felt rejected, a communal orphan. We can understand intuitively why this man railed at his Maker.\nMy husband argues that the blasphemy was not the emphasis, but in fact the outcome, of a larger failure; this was a young man who tried to find his place within the communal systems available. And still, no one stepped forward — not his mother, not the tribe of Dan, not even Moshe (and there is biblical precedent for Moshe bringing the case to God, — which he did not do here — as in the case of B’not Tzelofchad). The death of this young man, then, was the result of the collective decision to eschew responsibility for his well being.\nMy husband is not the only deep thinker who feels this way. Ohr HaChaim states clearly that “we may deduce from the word Vayetze that the Israelites were not prepared to allocate space to that individual in their respective parts of the encampment, each one claiming that he did not belong there.” Rabbi Asher Wassertheil, author of Birkat Asher, emphasizes that this young man wanted to follow in his mother’s steps and be part of the Jewish people, and that his status was a grey area. “Although the Torah commands us to love the convert and not to wrong them,” he writes, “nonetheless they were not given a land inheritance.” \nI think his understanding of this story has merit. In my husband’s view, the young man should have been supported years before this incident escalated. Someone — anyone — should have stepped in and helped him find a place to belong. Where was his mother? His mother’s family? Where were the community’s leaders? How did no one notice this lonely young man earnestly looking to be a part of the Jewish people?\nWhen he brought it to court, still striving to capture the notice of the leaders of his community, they made a legal ruling to exclude him from camping with the tribe of Dan. They failed to “see the issue within the issue,” which is how Rashi describes the role of a judge, which would allow them to find a solution to the real problem at hand. And it behooved the community and its judges to follow the young man out of the courthouse, to care enough to assure him he had a place within the Jewish people. But they didn’t.\nIf they had, he might never have cursed God.\n***\nStill, I’m not convinced communal (ir)responsibility is what this text is about. The young man is certainly a sympathetic character, but if anything, I think that strengthens my side of the argument — some sins are simply too egregious not to punish, even when we want to absolve the sinner.\nBlasphemy is a capital sin. And even though the text describes what seemed to be a communal confusion in which the son of Shelomit was placed in custody (a rarity in the ancient Near East, notes Baruch Levine in The JPS Torah Commentary, perhaps denoting a communal reluctance to penalize) before his execution, he was ultimately put to death by stoning, and God codified the impermissibility of blasphemy in subsequent pesukim: “Anyone who blasphemes God shall bear the guilt; and one who also pronounces the Name shall be put to death. The community leadership shall stone that person; stranger or citizen—having thus pronounced the Name—shall be put to death.”\nGrowing up, we learned that the many biblical prohibitions against idol worship were necessary because of how pervasive it was in the Ancient Near East. We might not understand the appeal of avodah zara, our teachers explained, but the many condemnations of pagan worship and the severe punishment (also death — by decapitation or stoning, depending on how the worship was done) reflect how great a crime it was.\nSimilarly, I think, we may not understand the severity of the crime of blasphemy today. Perhaps, in the 21st Century, it has gone the way of gore and sex — depicted so openly and unabashedly — that we have lost the intrinsic sense of shock we might have once felt when engaging with blatant rejections of God. And it isn’t a stretch to say that a culture defined by its denial of human limits may also manifest its egocentrism in condemnation of God.\n“Death and life are in the power of the tongue,” wrote Shlomo HaMelech in Proverbs. In the ancient world, blasphemy was considered a great evil. It is categorized as an inappropriate use of speech, which is warned against repeatedly in Tanach. \nIn her commentary on Vayikra, Nechama Leibowitz quotes Rabbi A.Y. Kook, who wrote that “even when man’s spiritual level has reached a very low ebb and he is impervious to all and any moral thoughts and pure sentiments, the Divine voice within him, nevertheless, does not cease to call out.” She cites several other thinkers who emphasized the gift of speech and the responsibility humans have to use it properly. In the context of this parasha, the implication is that the blasphemer tried to silence his Divine voice out of anger — with disastrous consequences.\nBefore the young man was stoned, he was to be taken outside the camp, and every person who heard him blaspheme were instructed to lay their hands upon his head. In Covenant and Conversation, Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks notes that this is entirely unique. In no other cases of the death sentence do the Jewish people lay their hands upon the person who is about to be executed. Why did this young man’s blasphemy trigger this ritual?\nIt’s not that blasphemy causes injury to God, Rabbi Sacks explains. But blasphemy does cause injury to humanity. “The witnesses are to lay their hands on the sinner, to indicate that they understand that this affects all of them. Language has been debased. Something sacred has been abused. A word — God’s name — that signals peace has been used like a weapon in a fight.”\nTwo thousand years after the first blasphemer was executed, the Talmud recorded a debate about blasphemy. Within the discussion, some of the scholars of the Talmud stated that a witness to blasphemy must tear his clothing, in an act resembling the keriah ritual mourners observe. Like Rabbi Sacks, they emphasized the impact blasphemy has on the person who hears it.\nBut Rav Ḥiyya disagreed. A person who heard God’s name blasphemed did not need to tear his shirt, he argued, because if he had to do so in his day and age, “the entire garment [would] be full of tears.” \n***\nMaybe we do live in a time of unrestrained blasphemy, and maybe it impacts us more than we know. Maybe each one of us should be walking around in shredded clothing.\nIf so, how do we counter the impact — the spiritual violence — of blasphemy?\nPerhaps, in the words of poet Charles Reznikoff,\nLet us begin humbly. Not by asking:\nWho is This you pray to? Name Him;\ndefine Him. For the answer is:\nWe do not name Him.\nOnce out of a savage fear, perhaps;\nnow out of knowledge—of our ignorance.\n__\nCredit where credit is due: Thank you, Max, for being a thought partner and for challenging me always, even (or maybe especially!) when we are on vacation."}

These events, described by some as intimidation, have ignited debate across Europe about religious freedom, state intervention, and the limits of tradition in modern democratic societies.\nBut amid the anxiety and outrage, we would do well to take a step back and ask a more fundamental question: What rights do children have in all of this?\nAs someone who advocates for Jewish families who choose not to circumcise their sons, I approach these developments with deep compassion for my fellow Jews who feel that their religious lives are under siege. At the same time, I believe these events offer an opportunity to examine circumcision from another perspective—one that prioritizes the bodily autonomy and health of infants, and recognizes the diversity of thought within Judaism itself.\nA Tension Between Tradition and Rights\nNo one should minimize the cultural and spiritual significance of brit milah in Jewish life. For millennia, circumcision has been a sign of covenant, identity, and belonging. But traditions—especially those involving irreversible physical alteration of a child—deserve rigorous ethical scrutiny. The growing global conversation around children’s rights, consent, and medical ethics invites us to rethink long-held practices.\nIt’s telling that one of the catalysts for the current legal scrutiny in Belgium is the practice of metzitzah b’peh, an element of brit milah that has caused fatal infections in infants. That authorities are investigating these cases should not be construed solely as antisemitism or persecution. Rather, it reflects society’s growing concern with safeguarding children’s health and well-being—an interest that should be embraced, not feared.\nRitual vs. Medical Standards\nBelgium’s laws require that medical procedures be carried out by licensed professionals. Religious circumcisions performed by unlicensed mohels in non-clinical environments challenge this framework. While legal clarity is needed—ideally in consultation with Jewish leaders, medical experts, and human rights advocates—it is not unreasonable for a democratic society to require accountability and oversight where children’s bodies are concerned.\nWe should also be mindful of how this issue is framed. Claims that any regulation of circumcision is tantamount to expelling Jews from Europe are inflammatory and counterproductive. While vigilance against antisemitism is essential, not every state intervention into religious practices is an act of bigotry. There is a difference between banning Jewish life and creating laws that reflect modern ethical standards.\nThat said, while I strongly support protecting children’s health and safety, I don’t believe that comprehensive medical training is always necessary for someone performing a ritual circumcision. For generations, mohels have acquired extensive practical knowledge through rigorous apprenticeships and hands-on training, often under the supervision of highly experienced practitioners. This traditional model of instruction, rooted in continuity and care, has long produced individuals with a high level of skill in this specific procedure—often more so than medical practitioners who may receive only limited exposure to circumcision during their education and beyond. \nA Space for Pluralism\nWithin Judaism itself, voices are emerging that challenge the necessity of circumcision. Some Jewish parents are choosing to forgo brit milah in favor of alternative welcoming ceremonies that honor the child without altering their body. These families should not be marginalized or accused of betraying their heritage—they are part of an evolving Jewish landscape that embraces compassion, critical thought, and autonomy.\nBelgium’s situation underscores the urgent need for honest, respectful dialogue—between religious communities and governments, and within Judaism itself. We must hold space for tradition, yes, but also for questioning tradition. And above all, we must place the needs and rights of children—who cannot consent—at the center of these conversations.\nThe future of Judaism will not be secured through fear or inflexible adherence to the past. It will endure because we have the courage to engage deeply with our values, to ask hard questions, and to grow.\n—\nRebecca Wald, J.D. is co-founder and executive director of Bruchim, a U.S.-based nonprofit that supports non-circumcising Jews in Jewish life, and educates about the rich diversity of Jewish perspectives on circumcision and its alternatives."}

But before long, he was dining with Kim in the Demilitarized Zone and praising his ‘beautiful vision for his country.’ Trump used to talk tough about Qatar’s financing of terrorism, too. Today he’s accepting Qatari planes and building a golf resort in Doha…\nWe all know that Trump doesn’t believe in permanent enemies. Nor does he believe in permanent friends, as evidenced by his treatment of Ukraine. Trump doesn’t believe in anything permanent. That’s why the word ‘transactional’ has become the default characterization of his thinking. If you enter a deal with Trump, and he gets something of value out of it, you’re a friend—at least for the moment. If he doesn’t, you’re an enemy—until you make it up to him.\nThat last paragraph should be read and re-read by those Israelis and Jews who insist “but Trump loves Israel!”, until they understand who they’re dealing with.\nYes, it is true that Trump did things that no other President had done which were great for Israel. But the reason was not because of any deep love for Israel. In fact, many previous Presidents who would never have moved the Embassy to Jerusalem, or taken out Soleimani, or pushed along the Abraham Accords, genuinely loved Israel in a way that Trump is incapable of.\nTrump’s great benefit to Israel has been his willingness – unique among US Presidents – to completely dismiss the conventions and unwritten rules of “what’s done”, declared by the State Department or by international institutions. Many of those conventions are not fit-for-purpose when dealing with the Hobbesian reality of the Middle East; Trump, who thrives in a ‘state-of-nature’ environment where the most powerful and the least restrained triumph, instinctively understands that.\nThe problem comes, as we are now discovering, when he decides that other Middle East countries can benefit the US – and him personally. Unlike a Reagan, or either Bush, or Clinton, or Biden, there’s no voice in Trump’s head telling him that Israel has something all these Arab autocracies lack: shared democratic values with the US. He just doesn’t think like that. The idea of America as the leader of the democratic world does not speak to him; democracy itself does not interest him beyond its utility as a means of achieving power. (And, as we saw in 2020, when it does not do the job of getting him into power, he rejects it.)\nA different Israeli government than the one we’re currently saddled with could be leveraging Trump’s unique take on the Middle East to our advantage. Imagine just how different these last few months would have been with a different government – one not constrained by the ideological commitments of the far-right. As Yair Lapid said yesterday:\nNetanyahu had two options. Either to do something in Khan Younis for the sixth time, or to be in Riyadh — to sit at the head of a table in Saudi Arabia and be part of agreements on a scale we’ve never known, bringing historic change to the Middle East.\nThe opportunity that Trump’s election provided could have taken us in a completely different direction. The bonkers notion that Trump might just be serious about creating a “Gaza Riviera” did force the Sunni Arab states to finally stop their finger-wagging on the sidelines and come forward with their own post-war plan. Their sudden willingness to help create a new Gaza without Hamas could have been, if not necessarily embraced, then not summarily dismissed without any discussion.\nA Prime Minister Lapid (or Bennett or Gantz) would likely not have ended the ceasefire after the first phase, preventing the return of more hostages, but would have sat down with the Americans, the Egyptians, and the Emiratis, and potentially agreed on a plan that Israel could live with: Hamas not totally destroyed, but out of power, replaced by an Arab states/Palestinian technocratic government to rebuild and stabilize Gaza, while Israel would retain freedom of military action to eliminate terrorists. (As already proposed by a number of Israeli security and policy veterans.) The war would be over, more hostages would return, and we wouldn’t be calling up thousands of exhausted reservists to abandon their families and their jobs for another indefinite period.\nAnd think about what’s happened in the last few days. Trump has just signed a gargantuan defense agreement with the Saudis, with no requirement for any positive moves towards Israel! Imagine that different Israeli government, one that had ended the war in Gaza and was willing to at least commit to the principle of Palestinian statehood in the future (following a program of Palestinian deradicalization and reform of their government and education system). Saudi normalization would be back on the table. Trump might well have been on his way to Israel from the Gulf to help move things along, instead of the current situation where he sees Netanyahu as fundamentally an obstacle to progress.\nI’m not naive about Trump, and if I were an American I’d be appalled by the sledgehammer he’s taking to the US Constitution; but his total disregard for the rules of the game does create opportunities in the Middle East, where Israel has frequently been disadvantaged by being the only player trying to observe the “rules”. And ironically, it’s this Israeli government, doing its best to ape Trump’s assault on institutions and the rule of law at home, that is criminally wasting the opportunities he’s providing in the region."}

As she turns to leave, she tells me, “Mama, be sad now,” and waits patiently for me to fake some tears. Only then will she gingerly walk towards the door, and yell, “I’ll be right back, OK?!” But this game is better than her last game. Because the previous game she loved playing was sitting in the living room imitating a rocket siren. And she is so good at it that she kept freaking us all out.\nI wonder every single day what the long term effects of war are going to be for my children. We were once at the park when a siren went off and my 9-year-old suddenly stopped being a child. He ran over to me, barked a command like an army sergeant, “You take the younger two; I’ll go grab my brother,” and ran to reach my 7-year-old and bring him to safety.\nTime and time again, their abba (father) has had to leave them for months at a time. They are proud that Abba is a soldier keeping us safe, and they are confused and hurt that he has left them. We have picked up the shattered pieces of their hearts countless times, and rebuilt relationships in between army rounds, again and again.\nMy husbands army boots and uniform, before the last round he got called up to serve\nThey know the rules. If you are outside, run to the nearest building and stand in the stairwell. If you are in the house mid-shower, dry off carefully and come to the safe room. If it’s the middle of the night, make sure your siblings are all there and then go back to sleep. They make origami weapons to keep everyone safe. They know that their parents will do anything to keep them safe.\nMy son’s origami ‘pew-pew’ as he calls it. He has a belt and rubber bands to shoot and everything. Oof.\nBut what are the long-term effects on my children going to be, and how do I minimize the damage?\nAs a ’90s kid, I grew up in Israel with bombs on buses, intifadas, knife terror attacks, and so much more. I’ve found three things have held me up over the years, and though I am not a professional and this is in no way professional advice, here are the three things I do to instill resilience in my children.\nNumber 1: LAUGH\nWhen we run to safety, I’ve noticed some of my kids will shake. It’s the noise that scares them more than anything else — especially the little ones. They don’t even understand what a rocket is. So let’s laugh. Let’s be silly together. We laugh about how the siren caught me in the bathroom or my son in the middle of his shower. We laugh that his underwear is in the other room and he’s just in a towel. We say things like, “Yay, now we have an excuse to be late for school!” Focusing on the funny and the positive is a lifesaver, and helps us snap back into reality.\nKids lying down on the ground because of a siren that went off just as everyone was heading to school. (Sar-El Ben Tzvi)\nNumber 2: SING and DANCE\nI don’t know if you’ve been in a kindergarten or school since October 7th, but these kids are well-trained. As soon as we go into a bomb shelter, my kids start singing Am Yisrael Chai, jumping on the beds, dancing… Any and all movement is welcome. Sometimes we sing Acheinu, and sometimes we’ll sing a Static and Ben El song… It so doesn’t matter. But the movement sends our bodies a clear message: Don’t be confused. We are strong and we are unafraid.\nNumber 3: PRAY\nMy ability to tell my children that the big boss is watching over us gives my children a sense of calm and security. We have a purpose. We live in the land of Israel for a reason, and it’s all part of the big boss’s plan.\nI don’t know how my children will be when they grow up. And I don’t know what the future holds. What I do know is that if this is our reality then we need to take steps to make it the best version it can be. And to give them the best tools to thrive here. I am no professional, but I am a parent living through a war with her children. And as someone who grew up in Israel during difficult times I can tell you this much. כאן נולדתי — Here is where I was (almost) born. כאן נולדו לי ילדיי — Here is where my children were born. כאן בניתי את ביתי בשתי ידיי — Here is where I built a home with my two hands. And it’s hard, and it’s crazy, but it’s exactly where we are supposed to be.\nSuperhero capes for my superhero children\nSo we laugh, we sing, we pray — and we keep going. Not because it’s easy, and not because we’re fearless, but because this is our home. We inject pockets of joy into the darkness and teach our children that even when the ground shakes and there are rockets above, we have the power to persevere. I don’t have all the answers. But I know that resilience is built in moments — in dancing in a shelter, in whispered prayers, in fake tears for a toddler’s game of goodbye. And if that’s what I can give my children in these uncertain days, then maybe, just maybe, it will be enough."}

The new pontiff grew up in Chicago and graduated from Villanova, a Catholic school, in 1977. Amid general excitement over the first US-born pope, my networks also erupted with Chicago and Villanova pride.\nYet as much as I loved the memes about deep dish pizza and basketball, I noticed that the most important part of my identity was absent from the pope’s profile: he didn’t seem to have a record on Jewish issues or any meaningful relationships with Jews. Jewish journalists searched for signs of what his election might mean for Jewish-Catholic relations. Little turned up.\nThe contrast with Leo’s predecessor is striking. Pope Francis collaborated closely with Argentine Jews during his years as a cardinal. When he was elected in 2013, some commentators charted possible directions for Jewish-Catholic dialogue. Leo’s record offers no such clarity.\nHowever, Francis also shows that a pope’s personal connections with Jews are no perfect predictor. By the time he died last month, Jewish-Catholic dialogue was at its most tense since World War II due to what many Jews (and some Catholics) perceived as his lack of sympathy for Israel in its war against Hamas. One leading Catholic journalist even identified the “crisis” in Jewish-Catholic relations as the most underreported Vatican story of 2024.\nIt wasn’t just about Israel, though. Long before the war, Francis repeatedly echoed “old-fashioned” Christian anti-Judaism. This included disparaging comments about Jesus’s Jewish contemporaries and the Torah. By the time he cited the single most anti-Jewish “New Testament” verse on the first anniversary of the October 7 attack, the pattern was clear.\nTracking a new pope’s personal relationships with Jews only gets you so far. Their local context is just as important. Like all people, popes are products of their local context. Yet unlike all people, popes elevate that context to a global stage, bringing it to bear on the whole church — including its stance toward Jews.\nTo fully understand why Leo’s context matters, we need to compare it to his predecessor’s. The Argentine Francis was the first pope from what is often called the Global South: countries in South/Central America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia that have been marginalized and exploited by Eurocentrism. This is where Catholicism is growing most rapidly. Francis’s work confronting poverty, violence, and colonialism in Latin America directly shaped his global purview and focus on social justice. These characteristics endeared him to US Jews, who have little interest in church doctrine, but skew politically liberal.\nAt the same time, Francis’s local context had complicated consequences for his approach to Jewish-Catholic relations. For one, there simply aren’t many Jews in the Global South. The Jewish population of Argentina is actually the region’s largest, but it is small, both percentage-wise and compared to other Jewish centers. In Francis’s world, the Jews that Catholics encounter most frequently are the villains in the Christian Bible. This surely had impact on his religious education, perhaps explaining his habit of unreflectively invoking Christian anti-Judaism.\nMoreover, Francis was the first post-war pope without direct connections to the Holocaust. This matters because the Holocaust has been the main motivator for Jewish-Catholic reconciliation, especially as reflected in the reforms of Vatican II. While Francis obviously deplored the Holocaust, he saw it as enjoining the church with a universal commitment to humanity, rather than a special commitment to Jews. That is different from how European Catholics often see things. Tellingly, some of the harshest Catholic critics of Francis’s Israel statements were German.\nDrawing on his local context, Pope Francis called for a church committed to justice for marginalized groups. US Jews rightly admired this vision. Yet, due to the very same context, Francis did not intuitively count Jews among those marginalized groups — even though there has arguably been no single group more historically marginalized (to put it mildly) by the Catholic Church itself. In this way, Francis embodied an inconvenient truth: because progress in Jewish-Catholic relations has been so intertwined with the European experience, future progress is uncertain, as the Catholic Church becomes less Eurocentric.\nThis is where Pope Leo XIV comes in.\nLeo spent most of his pre-Vatican career in Peru, where he confronted the same issues that Francis did. As a naturalized Peruvian citizen, he has been called the second Latin American pope, in addition to the first US one. There is every reason to believe that he will continue his predecessor’s progressive focus on poverty, immigration justice, and climate change.\nBut that does not mean that we should brace for similar Jewish-Catholic tensions. Although Leo left the United States, he did still grow up there. In contrast to Francis’s context, the United States is perhaps the most flourishing Jewish diaspora in history. There are, in fact, almost twice as many Jews in Chicago alone as there are in all of Argentina. While they constitute a small percentage of the overall US population, they play an outsized cultural role. Moreover, although the Holocaust does not implicate US Catholics in the same way as European ones, it casts a long shadow because World War II is so central to US national identity.\nThese realities matter. Although US Catholics are politically and culturally divided, they consistently report high opinions of Jews. This includes affirming Jews’ covenant with God, denying that the Jews killed Jesus, rejecting proselytization, and sympathizing with the State of Israel.\nInstitutionally, the US church prioritizes Jewish-Catholic relations. Most Catholic universities support Jewish studies and/or Jewish student groups. Many — including the Chicago seminary where Leo studied — have centers for Jewish-Catholic dialogue. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops even declares that the church’s “unique relationship with the Jewish people is grounded in a shared heritage, making it unlike any other dialogue with another religious tradition.”\nThat does not mean anything definitive about Pope Leo’s own views. But my point is that his views aren’t the whole picture. Whether he wants to or not, he is bringing US Catholicism with him to Rome in an unprecedented way. A local Catholic culture with rich Jewish-Catholic engagement is gaining a global profile. Catholics with deep commitments to Jews have a new platform.\nTo be clear, US Jews hoping for a sudden pro-Israel shift in the Vatican will almost certainly be disappointed. The new pontiff resumed his predecessor’s calls for a ceasefire in his first Sunday address. Official church policy on Israel or the war is unlikely to change.\nWhat I do think US Jews may reasonably hope for, however, is improvement in the general climate of Jewish-Catholic relations. Many US Jews strongly identified with Francis’s progressive agenda, but felt burned by his insensitivity to Jewish concerns and experiences. If any pope could give Jews the best of both worlds, it would be one who grew up in the United States, but developed his pastoral commitments in the most underprivileged countries on earth.\nThat is exactly who the conclave elected in Pope Leo XIV."}

Imagine that same country hosts the largest U.S. military installation in the Middle East, funds universities like Georgetown and Harvard, and also – stay with me – hosts the political leadership of a group internationally recognized as a terrorist organization.\nNow imagine that this country is not sanctioned. Not scrutinized. But rather… praised. Upgraded. Promoted to “Major Non-NATO Ally” status.\nYou don’t have to imagine it. You just have to name it: Qatar.\nA mathematical contradiction dressed in cashmere\nQatar is not a mystery. It is a contradiction, plainly executed and politely ignored.\nIt is the patron of Hamas and the host of Al-Udeid Air Base. It shelters Yusuf al-Qaradawi, the ideological godfather of the Muslim Brotherhood, and also co-sponsors interfaith luncheons with UNESCO. It bankrolls the Brookings Institution while wiring money to Gaza. It throws its gas money at think tanks, media outlets, K–12 programs, lobbyists, and – when things get tough – real estate developers posing as U.S. envoys.\nYes, I’m referring to Steve Witkoff, who in 2019 received a discreet $623 million bailout from a Qatari fund after his real estate venture collapsed. Witkoff had also been appointed as a U.S. special envoy under the Trump administration.\nLet me put that plainly: the man paid to represent American interests abroad was, at the same time, financially rescued by the foreign power whose influence he might otherwise have had to question.\nBut let’s not call that corruption. Let’s call it “strategic liquidity.”\nThe linguistic exhaustion of truth\nThere’s another reason no one’s paying attention – and it’s subtler, but just as dangerous.\nThe names are hard. The words are unfamiliar.\nAl-Thani. Qaradawi. Ikhwan. Al-Udeid. Al-anything.\nIt overloads the Western brain. Not because people are stupid, but because they’re tired. This isn’t London, Berlin, or Moscow. This is a glossary of Arab names and ideological sub-factions that blur into one another unless you’ve spent years tracing tribal histories and doctrinal schisms.\nAnd so, the brain gives up. Not violently. Passively. Silently. Elegantly.\nIt says: Let someone else figure this out.\nAnd that is exactly how Qatar wins.\nQatar hides not in shadows – but in syllables. It survives not through censorship, but through the fatigue of translation. We mistake our unfamiliarity for irrelevance, our cognitive friction for someone else’s jurisdiction. And in that space – between effort and avoidance – truth dies of exhaustion.\nThe empire builds a puppet, and the puppet builds a network\nQatar’s rise is not a tale of regional genius. It is a function of British imperial engineering followed by American resource extraction. BP discovered the oil. ExxonMobil built the gas economy. The West constructed the skeleton. Qatar animated the body – with Brotherhood blood and Al Jazeera skin.\nBut here’s the innovation: rather than destabilizing the West directly, Qatar became the invisible hand that funds the narratives that rot it from within.\nThink tanks. Fellowships. Campus centers. “Dialogue initiatives.” Every lever that shapes consensus was quietly greased. And when dissent or questions emerge – about Qatar’s labor abuses, its funding of Hamas, its manipulation of U.S. media narratives – the criticism vanishes into an epistemic fog of “complex geopolitics.”\nWe don’t censor anymore. We obfuscate by saturation. We don’t rebut arguments. We fund their inverse.\nThe Brotherhood will be branded\nRemember Yusuf al-Qaradawi – the Brotherhood’s theologian-in-chief? He wasn’t just given asylum. He was given a studio. His show Shariah and Life on Al Jazeera reached 60 million viewers, many of whom would never see a critical interview, only the sermon.\nWhat Qatar built was not just a media empire. It was a distributed propaganda system with the aesthetics of journalism and the objectives of clerical revolution. It was Brotherhood ideology with a sleek chyron and a budget that rivaled CNN’s.\nAnd the West? It clapped. Because it saw “Arab liberalization” through the warped lens of Western wishcasting. Meanwhile, the actual liberal Arabs fled, the Islamists surged, and Qatar cashed the geopolitical dividends.\nThe politics of gratitude\nWhich brings us to the most disorienting moment of all.\nEdan Alexander, a young Israeli-American IDF soldier, was held captive in a Hamas cage for 584 days. He is the longest-held hostage to be released alive. His release was not facilitated through traditional Israeli diplomacy, but via a shadow channel involving President Trump, Steve Witkoff, and Qatari and Egyptian mediation.\nWhat followed was a story not of healing, but of optics.\nWithin days of his release, reports circulated suggesting Edan might travel to Qatar – alongside Trump – to personally thank the Emir for his role in the deal. A press moment. A public performance. A survivor-turned-stage prop.\nFortunately, reality intervened. Edan isn’t going. He has a doctor’s note, so to speak. According to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the Alexander family confirmed that Edan will not be flying to Qatar.\nBut here’s the part we shouldn’t skip past: he was expected to.\nThe very fact that anyone considered this acceptable – that an Israeli hostage, caged by Hamas for 584 days, would be flown to the palace of the regime that funds Hamas to say “thank you” – is its own indictment.\nThe spectacle, not the survivor\nLet us be absolutely clear:\nEdan is not to blame. Nor are his family. Their loyalty is intact. Their pain is unimaginable. Their gratitude is human. The shame lies not with them – but with the structure that tried to weaponize their dignity for diplomatic theater.\nIt is the spectacle that is grotesque.\nThe image of a Jewish soldier, still metabolizing his trauma, being asked to shake hands with the men who wrote checks to his jailers – this is not diplomacy. It is not mediation. It is not strategy.\nIt is ritual humiliation, masked as statesmanship.\nIt doesn’t just bypass Israeli sovereignty.\nIt doesn’t just whitewash Qatari duplicity.\nIt flips the moral polarity of the entire story.\nIn place of justice, we get branding.\nIn place of healing, we get optics.\nIn place of memory, we get spectacle.\nAnd in doing so, we signal – perhaps permanently – that there is no act of cruelty that can’t be turned into a press release, if the gas is flowing and the cameras are rolling.\nWhat are we willing to ignore?\nThere is a machine at work here – a kind of influence laundering system that operates in the open, under the cover of diplomacy and donor class consensus. The Brotherhood has found its banker. The West has found its blind spot. And Qatar? It found its loophole in civilization.\nSo the question is: what are we willing to ignore in exchange for gas contracts, military bases, and the relief of not having to pronounce “Qaradawi” correctly?\nAnd if the answer is: a young Jew in a cage, followed by an invitation to thank the men who paid for the cage – then we already know who we’ve become."}

You guessed it: Zero", "media_type": "blog", "date": "MAY 13, 2025, 4:29 PM", "content": "Last week, we saw an astonishing announcement: Israel’s Minister for Social Equality will appoint a man to serve as Director General of her ministry – at a time when there are zero women serving as directors general across more than thirty government ministries. This statistic has become emblematic not only of the government’s stance toward women’s representation and the value of equality, but also of a broader defiance of the law, which mandates adequate representation of women in the public service.\nBeyond the principles of reason and the commitment to equality, less than three months ago, the Supreme Court ruled that the state is not meeting its obligation for equal representation of women. One would think that such a clear-cut ruling – emphasizing the worsening underrepresentation of women in the current government – would prompt a course correction.\nAnd yet, since that decision, five directors general have been appointed – all of them men. Can one truly imagine that no suitable woman could be found to lead the Ministries of Finance, Innovation, Environmental Protection, Communications, or Defense? Of course not. This simply reflects utter disregard for the Supreme Court’s ruling and for obligations under the law, as well as a broader lack of commitment to women’s representation. Rather than publicly declaring, as in other recent cases, that ministers do not intend to comply with the Court’s rulings, in this case they simply ignore it. \nNow this problematic pattern has been joined by the announcement of the leadership for the Ministry for Social Equality. The ministry, whose very mission is grounded in the value of equality – the one tasked within the government with advancing the status of women and gender equality – will now also be led by a man. In other words, instead of setting an example, living up to its mandate, and even calling on other ministers to do so, the Ministry for Social Equality is itself joining in the blatant and contemptuous disregard for the law.\nIn a reality where there are zero female directors general in government ministries, no further data is needed to illustrate the scope of the discrimination. But if historical context is still required, data collected by Israel Democracy Institute researchers reveals that since 2003, only 38 women have been appointed director general out of 243 appointments – a mere 16%. This figure is far from impressive for any Israeli government, though even that is higher than zero. In a discussion held this week by the Knesset Committee for the Advancement of the Status of Women and Gender Equality, even more troubling data were presented by the Knesset Research and Information Center regarding the representation of Haredi women, Arab women, and women of Ethiopian descent in senior public service roles – often in the single digits.\nThis reflects yet another example of a government that is out of step with the public. A recent IDI study found that 71% of the public believe the number of women in the Knesset, in the government, and in senior public positions should be increased, with the goal of achieving equal representation between men and women. Only 25% expressed opposition. This is not a partisan issue. A majority of Israelis across the political left (81%), center (90%) and right (60%) supported increasing the number of women in public service roles.\nThe Supreme Court ruled in its decision that the government must formulate guidelines by August to ensure appropriate representation for women in political appointments, including director general posts. As things currently stand, it seems the government will first need to be reminded of its basic obligation to the rule of law before it can even begin drafting such guidelines."}

A quiet Midwesterner with a crisp Chicago accent, a math degree from Villanova University, as well as decades of missionary and administrative service under his belt, Prevost is not some flamboyant Jesuit media darling. He is, instead, a meticulous operator whose loyalty to the clerical order and instinct for institutional repair hint at a conservative pragmatism wrapped in pastoral softness. It is the kind of development that both CNN and Columbia University will misread, one by dismissing him as “low profile,” the other by projecting onto him another liberal internationalist. He is neither. And that is precisely the point.\nA Man From Chicago, Formed in Peru\nPrevost’s background has the elements of a Jesuit travelogue without the vanity. Born in Chicago in 1955, he entered the Order of St. Augustine, studied theology in Rome, and spent most of the 1980s and 1990s in Peru. He worked as a missionary, then a bishop, during one of Latin America’s more turbulent phases, rebuilding parishes, rooting out clerical rot, and fending off the ideological detritus of liberation theology. He returned to Rome with a reputation for competence rather than charisma.\nUnder Pope Francis, however, Prevost rose quickly. As prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, he helped shape the episcopacy of the global South with the care of a man who doesn’t trust ideological blueprints. He was part of the Vatican’s operational core, not its publicity wing. That is exactly why his election surprised the chattering class. They weren’t paying attention.\nDoctrine Without Apology\nPrevost is not a revolutionary. He belongs to that rare breed of prelates who take orthodoxy as a starting point, not a problem to be managed. His theological writings suggest a thinker comfortable with Thomas Aquinas but emotionally tuned to Augustine: pessimistic about human nature, deeply sacramental, and cautious about the promises of modernity. He’s not interested in revising moral theology to flatter the age. He believes, astonishingly enough, that the Church exists to save souls.\nHe supports mercy, but not as an alibi. He tolerates pastoral flexibility, but not doctrinal drift. During the Amazon Synod, he remained skeptical of proposals to ordain married men. He has also quietly resisted German efforts to bless same-sex unions and redefine sin along cultural lines. He is not out to excommunicate the confused, but neither will he baptize confusion.\nPolitical Without Partisan Delusion\nThe political instincts of Leo XIV defy the taxonomy beloved by pundits. He is not a banner-waving conservative, but neither is he a proxy for the Soros-funded clerical avant-garde. His experience in Latin America made him wary of both economic oligarchy and class warfare slogans. He has spoken of inequality as a moral concern, not a campaign slogan. He supported Francis’s environmentalism only insofar as it remained moral, not technocratic.\nPrevost sees the modern state as both necessary and dangerous—a position closer to Hobbes than Rousseau. He believes in order. He respects subsidiarity. He doubts that bureaucracies can save us. In today’s Rome, this qualifies as heresy.\nTrump: Enemy, Ally, or Interlocutor?\nHe has never commented on President Donald Trump directly, and he likely never will. But his Vatican record is revealing. When some U.S. bishops tried to aggressively discipline pro-Trump clergy or push blanket condemnations of “Christian nationalism,” Prevost counseled caution. Not because he supports the former president, but because he understands what Trumpism represents: a political insurgency born of cultural dislocation.\nIn a Church hemorrhaging the working class, Prevost knows better than to treat populists as lepers. He doesn’t moralize about MAGA hats. He listens. In an ecclesial environment increasingly dominated by NGO-speak and bourgeois sensitivities, that makes him both countercultural and, paradoxically, pastoral.\nZionism and the Jews: A Return to Dialogue\nIf Francis’s Vatican flirted with fashionable anti-Zionism—hosting Mahmoud Abbas, parroting UN talking points—Leo XIV is a corrective. Prevost has visited Israel repeatedly. He has expressed admiration for the resilience of Jewish life and has cultivated ties with Jewish leaders in Peru, the United States, and Europe. He does not sentimentalize the Palestinian cause, nor reduce the Middle East to a victim-oppressor binary.\nAccording to sources in Rome, Prevost views Israel as “a moral project within history”—a phrase that startled the Latin desk at the Secretariat of State. He has called Netanyahu “a necessary man in dangerous times,” which, in Vaticanese, borders on radical candor. There will be no warm embraces for Hamas delegates under this papacy.\nOn May 12, three days after his election, Pope Leo XIV has chosen to reaffirm his commitment to Catholic-Jewish relations as his first official act. In a letter to major Jewish organizations, he pledged to continue and deepen the Church’s dialogue with the Jewish people, invoking the spirit and principles of Nostra Aetate, the landmark declaration of the Second Vatican Council, which repudiated antisemitism, rejected the charge of collective Jewish guilt for the death of Jesus, and called for mutual respect and understanding between Catholics and Jews.\nNaming Himself Leo: Not Just Optics\nPope Leo XIV is a name loaded with historical weight. Leo XIII was the pope of Rerum Novarum, a relevant historical figure who steered the Church into the industrial era without capitulating to socialism. Leo I—“the Great”—confronted Attila the Hun, defined Christological orthodoxy, and asserted the primacy of Rome in the face of imperial collapse.\nPrevost’s choice signals continuity with both: a concern for social justice without surrendering to ideology, and a readiness to confront the barbarism of the present age without apology. It is not the name of a caretaker pope. It is the name of someone who intends to lead.\nAugustine in the Time of Decline\nSt. Augustine’s influence on Prevost is not merely devotional. It is constitutional. Like Augustine, Prevost sees man as fallen, society as contingent, and salvation as outside history. He does not believe we are marching toward a humanist utopia. He does not view progress as linear. He believes the Church must navigate history without worshipping it.\nThis Augustinian realism—so at odds with the optimism of post-Conciliar politics—may be the defining feature of his papacy. While Francis embraced Fratelli Tutti as a blueprint for global fraternity, Leo XIV may lean instead into Civitas Dei: the reminder that the City of God and the City of Man are distinct, often adversarial, and never to be confused.\nA Papacy of Conversation, Not Collision\nWas Prevost chosen to confront the rising right? To domesticate Trump? No. That would require a different man and a different Church. Leo XIV was chosen not to clash with the West but to reintroduce Rome to it. He represents neither anti-Americanism nor Eurocratic liberalism. He is a Midwestern Catholic who understands that the postwar order is unravelling and that the Church cannot stake its future on NGOs, Soros panels, or permanent diplomacy.\nHe may be the only man on earth capable of holding a serious conversation with Trump and also with Viktor Orbán, with Netanyahu and with Macron and capable of reminding each that no throne endures forever.\nThe College of Cardinals did not elect a media darling or a placeholder. It elected a man who understands power, understands decline, and does not confuse the two. Leo XIV does not preach the end of history, nor does he curate moods for dying empires. He speaks for a Church that remembers what it is. Against the backdrop of soft authoritarianism, moral drift, and elite frivolity, Rome has chosen sobriety. The Holy Ghost may not have fully delivered yet, but at least it’s a beginning; for a Church that measures change in millennia, even a token course-correction is enough to keep up the illusion of motion.\n(Amy K.

(Eyad BABA / AFP)\nEven if he was killed, though, it remains unclear how much of an impact his assassination would have on the terror group, whose senior leadership largely lives outside the Gaza Strip.\nIsraeli officials have described Sinwar as obstinate with regard to negotiations with Hamas for the release of hostages, and an obstacle to reaching a ceasefire deal. But unlike his brother, who had wielded considerable influence over the direction of talks and the group’s strategic planning, it seems Muhammad Sinwar had only a limited role in either.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLeadership vacuum\nThe younger Sinwar’s death might be felt keenly inside Hamas’s armed wing, where it would deepen a leadership vacuum, with most of the group’s top figures living abroad since the war began with the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack, in which thousands of terrorists killed some 1,200 people and abducted 251.\nThere are two potential successors who can replace him in managing Hamas’s military wing and attempting to rebuild it during the ongoing war.\nThe first is Izz ad-Din Haddad, commander of Hamas’s Gaza City Brigade, who is a longtime fixture within the senior echelons of Hamas’s armed wing. During the war, Haddad was promoted to oversee the entire Gaza Strip.\nIzz ad-Din Haddad, commander of Hamas’s Gaza City Brigade, in a video released by Hamas’s military wing, May 2022.\nHaddad rarely appears in public, but in May 2022 was seen in a video threatening Israel. In January, he went on Al-Jazeera and disclosed his role in planning the October 7 massacre. His face was blurred for the interview.\nAnother candidate is Mohammad Shabana, commander of the Rafah Brigade, who has risen through the ranks over the years. He reportedly survived an Israeli airstrike in May 2024 targeting a tunnel in Rafah. In March 2025, his wife and five children were killed in an Israeli strike.\nLike Haddad, Shabana is relatively unknown in Gaza and has not appeared in public during the war.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMuhammad Shabana (center) the commander of Hamas’s Rafah Brigade, attends a Hamas event in the Gaza Strip on June 7, 2023. (Hamas media office)\nBoth are veteran Hamas fighters who could help the organization continue its operations against Israel and even recover some strength.\nBut neither would likely have significant influence over Hamas’s strategic decision-making process, similar to the limited role played by Muhammad Sinwar.\nOh brother\nWhile Yahya Sinwar was a central Hamas figure with sway over ceasefire negotiations and final say over hostage deals, there is little evidence that his little brother has held a comparable position.\nYahya Sinwar was elected by Hamas members as the group’s Gaza leader in 2017 and officially appointed by the senior members of Hamas as the movement’s overall chief in August 2024. In contrast, Muhammad Sinwar has never been part of the political bureau.\nDespite operating while in hiding inside Gaza, unlike the rest of the group’s Qatar-based senior leadership, Yahya Sinwar was reportedly given final say in indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel that largely took place in Cairo.\nGaza Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza City on March 30, 2022. (Attia Muhammed/Flash90)\nIsraeli sources indicated that the need to consult with Sinwar for Hamas’s answer in talks led to significant delays, with an elaborate system of mediators used to convey messages back and forth, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n“We’ll have to wait for Yahya Sinwar’s reply from the tunnels on every comma and detail of the negotiation,” one Israeli defense source was quoted complaining in March 2024, according to Channel 12 news.\nNone of this occurred once Muhammad Sinwar took over. Recent negotiations have been conducted with Hamas’s political leadership outside Gaza, and there have been no reports of delays due to a need to wait for Mohammad Sinwar’s input. Even the indirect channel between Hamas and the United States that led to the release of hostage soldier Edan Alexander on Monday was conducted via senior Hamas officials in Qatar.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHamas senior member Khalil al-Hayya gives a televised speech rejecting Israel’s offer of a temporary truce and hostage release deal, on April 17, 2025. (Screen capture/X)\nThough Muhammad Sinwar was considered Hamas’s de facto chief, officially the group is run by a five-member leadership council.\nAll members are senior figures from the political wing with no direct involvement in military operations. All reside outside Gaza — some have been abroad for years, while others left the Strip shortly before the war began.\nThe council includes Hamas spokesman Khalil al-Hayya, who is its top man for Gaza, though he likely wields little sway inside the Strip from his Gulf perch.\nThe remaining council members are Khaled Mashaal, Hamas leader abroad; Zaher Jabarin, head of Hamas in the West Bank; Mohammad Darwish, head of Hamas’s Shura Council, who is responsible for long-term strategic decisions; and Nizar Awadallah, a member of Hamas’s political bureau.\nPalestinians inspect the damage following overnight Israeli strikes at the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip on April 29, 2025. (Eyad BABA / AFP)\nOperating from deep underground in Gaza, in limited contact with the group’s senior leadership and holding little experience outside of military affairs, it’s tough to see how Muhammad Sinwar could have been a decisive voice on the ceasefire issue.\nWhile Hamas’s armed wing has leverage in any hostage deal due to its direct custody of those it abducted from Israel on October 7, its influence over broader strategic decisions is limited.\nShould Sinwar’s death be confirmed, it will almost certainly have no impact on the group’s positions or demands in hostage and ceasefire negotiations, which will continue to be determined by the leadership outside of Gaza. The deepest impact, therefore, might simply be that the sides will no longer have him to blame for their inability to make progress on freeing the hostages and ending the war."}

Accordingly, the foundation said Israel has agreed “to allow the flow of transitional aid into Gaza under existing mechanisms” until the construction of SDSs is complete.\nGHF said it secured the concession from Israel after it sent a letter to the Israeli government that outlined the organization’s requirements for operation. The letter was sent by Jake Wood, the founder and former CEO of the Team Rubicon disaster relief group, who has agreed to come on as GHF’s executive director.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“There is no time to wait for ideal conditions. We have a responsibility to act and to do it without compromising our values,” Wood said in a statement.\n“Today we are one step closer to doing just that. GHF’s neutral, cooperative, and secure model will allow NGOs and humanitarian groups to operate safely, with minimized aid interdiction, resulting in maximum life-saving impact,” he added.\nIt is unclear which aid organizations will cooperate with GHF, though. UN-backed aid organizations currently operating in Gaza issued a joint statement earlier this month saying they would not join the effort, arguing that Israel’s conditions on GHF would leave vulnerable populations without humanitarian assistance.\nHumanitarian workers criticized the initial plan to have just four distribution sites in Gaza, along with other criteria only allowing one family representative chosen by Israel to pick up a roughly 40-lb box of assistance once every two weeks. They also argued that the requirement to then carry the box of aid long distances still exposed recipients to Hamas looting.\nFormer Marine Sgt.

Nonetheless, the IDF has warned the political echelon that the Strip is on the brink of starvation, the Israeli official told The Times of Israel.\nIn his letter to the Israeli government, Wood sought to address some of the concerns. He said the foundation would not share any personally identifiable information of aid recipients with Israel.\nWood also asked in the letter for the IDF to “identify and deconflict sufficient locations in northern Gaza capable of hosting GHF-operated secure distribution sites that can be made operational within thirty days.”\nPalestinians evacuate after the Israeli army issued an evacuation warning for several schools and a hospital in Gaza City’s Rimal neighborhood, Wednesday, May 14, 2025.

However, a GHF memo distributed to potential donor countries and organizations included names of several individuals it claimed would sit on its board, even though they had never agreed to do so, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\nThe GHF statement did not address all of the criticism and unanswered questions that the international community has about the group, including who would fund the work and how much involvement the US, Israel or any other government or military would have in controlling life-saving aid for Palestinian civilians.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMohammed Hanieh, a thirteen-year-old Palestinian boy who his family says suffers from malnutrition, stands in front of a mirror at his family home in the Bureij refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip on April 12, 2025.

The negotiators only have a mandate to discuss what the premier has referred to as the “Witkoff proposal,” which would see as many as half of the hostages released in exchange for a weekslong ceasefire. During that truce, Israel is prepared to hold talks regarding a permanent end to the war, but will accept nothing less than Hamas agreeing to disarm and give up governing control of Gaza.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHamas has said it is prepared to cede control of the Strip and agree to a yearslong truce with Israel that includes security guarantees. However, it has long refused demands that it permanently disarm.\nIt has also demanded guarantees from the mediators — potentially in the form of a binding UN Security Council resolution — that Israel be prevented from resuming the war if Hamas agrees to release hostages. Arab mediators say they face an uphill battle convincing Hamas to release hostages without assurances that Israel will end the war because the previous deal signed in January was supposed to see the sides enter talks regarding the terms of a permanent ceasefire, but Netanyahu largely refused to do so and the truce collapsed in March after its first of three phases.\nNurit Yohanan, Jacob Magid and Times of Israel staff contributed to this report."}

On one hand, Jews must obviously respect the laws of their countries,” Freilich said. “On the other hand, there has been a policy until now of the government turning a blind eye to this issue. The problem is not that brit milah is not allowed; it’s that there needs to be a clearer law about who can perform the procedure. We need to work together to find a solution.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nEuropean Jewish Association chairman Rabbi Menachem Margolin condemned the raids, calling them part of a larger campaign of intimidation against Jewish religious figures in Belgium.\n“Following the ban on ritual slaughter [in a 2019 law that requires that animals be stunned before they can be slaughtered for food], the harassment of mohels represents a further red line and a clear warning sign to Belgian Jews and the Belgian government,” Margolin said. “Any restriction on circumcision in Belgium would send a clear message to Belgian Jews that they are not welcome in the country.”\nBelgian MP Michael Freilich speaking to an audience in a synagogue in Belgium. (Courtesy)\nCutting under sharp scrutiny\nProsecutors in Antwerp, where most of Belgium’s approximately 30,000 Jews live, have been investigating illegal circumcisions since a renegade member of the Jewish community filed a series of complaints.\nIn November 2023, Rabbi Moshe Aryeh Friedman, an anti-Zionist activist from New York living in Antwerp, complained to police that six mohels were endangering children by using a controversial custom known as metzitzah b’peh in the circumcision process.\nThe practice involves mohels using their lips to suck blood from the penises of babies on whom they’d performed the Jewish ritual.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe controversial custom is thought to have caused the death of at least one child in New York in 2012 from herpes. Another outbreak among infants of Haredi families in New York occurred in 2017 and was attributed to metzitzah b’peh.\nThen, in September 2024, Friedman informed police that circumcisions were being performed without legal approvals, and a local television station reported on the issue, stoking local concern.\n“The only reason this is happening now is because of Friedman,” Freilich said. “That doesn’t mean it would never have happened, but he made it go much faster.”\nUnlicensed circumcisions are under increased scrutiny in Europe. Last summer, authorities in Ireland arrested a rabbi from London for allegedly performing circumcision without required medical credentials in what may be the first case in modern Europe of a rabbi arrested in connection with a brit milah.\nCircumcision is relatively uncommon among the general population of Europe, with only 10-20% of males having gone under the knife, compared to over 70% in the United States.\nMuslims generally undergo circumcision at a hospital, not in a religious ceremony, so the legislation is primarily a Jewish issue.\nMost countries do not have any specific legislation regarding circumcision, allowing the Jewish ritual to continue as a religious freedom without intervening, Freilich explained. Only Germany has a law specifically allowing non-medical practitioners to conduct the brit milah under appropriate medical and hygienic conditions.\nFreilich hopes to work with other European governments to adopt similar legislation allowing circumcision. He is also trying to encourage the EU to recognize certified mohels, he said."}

(Eyad BABA / AFP)\nEven if he was killed, though, it remains unclear how much of an impact his assassination would have on the terror group, whose senior leadership largely lives outside the Gaza Strip.\nIsraeli officials have described Sinwar as obstinate with regard to negotiations with Hamas for the release of hostages, and an obstacle to reaching a ceasefire deal. But unlike his brother, who had wielded considerable influence over the direction of talks and the group’s strategic planning, it seems Muhammad Sinwar had only a limited role in either.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLeadership vacuum\nThe younger Sinwar’s death might be felt keenly inside Hamas’s armed wing, where it would deepen a leadership vacuum, with most of the group’s top figures living abroad since the war began with the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack, in which thousands of terrorists killed some 1,200 people and abducted 251.\nThere are two potential successors who can replace him in managing Hamas’s military wing and attempting to rebuild it during the ongoing war.\nThe first is Izz ad-Din Haddad, commander of Hamas’s Gaza City Brigade, who is a longtime fixture within the senior echelons of Hamas’s armed wing. During the war, Haddad was promoted to oversee the entire Gaza Strip.\nIzz ad-Din Haddad, commander of Hamas’s Gaza City Brigade, in a video released by Hamas’s military wing, May 2022.\nHaddad rarely appears in public, but in May 2022 was seen in a video threatening Israel.

His face was blurred for the interview.\nAnother candidate is Mohammad Shabana, commander of the Rafah Brigade, who has risen through the ranks over the years. He reportedly survived an Israeli airstrike in May 2024 targeting a tunnel in Rafah. In March 2025, his wife and five children were killed in an Israeli strike.\nLike Haddad, Shabana is relatively unknown in Gaza and has not appeared in public during the war.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMuhammad Shabana (center) the commander of Hamas’s Rafah Brigade, attends a Hamas event in the Gaza Strip on June 7, 2023.

In contrast, Muhammad Sinwar has never been part of the political bureau.\nDespite operating while in hiding inside Gaza, unlike the rest of the group’s Qatar-based senior leadership, Yahya Sinwar was reportedly given final say in indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel that largely took place in Cairo.\nGaza Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza City on March 30, 2022. (Attia Muhammed/Flash90)\nIsraeli sources indicated that the need to consult with Sinwar for Hamas’s answer in talks led to significant delays, with an elaborate system of mediators used to convey messages back and forth, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n“We’ll have to wait for Yahya Sinwar’s reply from the tunnels on every comma and detail of the negotiation,” one Israeli defense source was quoted complaining in March 2024, according to Channel 12 news.\nNone of this occurred once Muhammad Sinwar took over. Recent negotiations have been conducted with Hamas’s political leadership outside Gaza, and there have been no reports of delays due to a need to wait for Mohammad Sinwar’s input. Even the indirect channel between Hamas and the United States that led to the release of hostage soldier Edan Alexander on Monday was conducted via senior Hamas officials in Qatar.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHamas senior member Khalil al-Hayya gives a televised speech rejecting Israel’s offer of a temporary truce and hostage release deal, on April 17, 2025.

All reside outside Gaza — some have been abroad for years, while others left the Strip shortly before the war began.\nThe council includes Hamas spokesman Khalil al-Hayya, who is its top man for Gaza, though he likely wields little sway inside the Strip from his Gulf perch.\nThe remaining council members are Khaled Mashaal, Hamas leader abroad; Zaher Jabarin, head of Hamas in the West Bank; Mohammad Darwish, head of Hamas’s Shura Council, who is responsible for long-term strategic decisions; and Nizar Awadallah, a member of Hamas’s political bureau.\nPalestinians inspect the damage following overnight Israeli strikes at the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip on April 29, 2025. (Eyad BABA / AFP)\nOperating from deep underground in Gaza, in limited contact with the group’s senior leadership and holding little experience outside of military affairs, it’s tough to see how Muhammad Sinwar could have been a decisive voice on the ceasefire issue.\nWhile Hamas’s armed wing has leverage in any hostage deal due to its direct custody of those it abducted from Israel on October 7, its influence over broader strategic decisions is limited.\nShould Sinwar’s death be confirmed, it will almost certainly have no impact on the group’s positions or demands in hostage and ceasefire negotiations, which will continue to be determined by the leadership outside of Gaza. The deepest impact, therefore, might simply be that the sides will no longer have him to blame for their inability to make progress on freeing the hostages and ending the war."}

Or that he effectively auctioned off the first destination on his first major foreign trip, heading to Saudi Arabia because the kingdom was ready to make big investments in US companies.\nIt’s not even that the Trump family has fast-growing business ties in the Middle East that run deep and offer the potential of vast profits.\nInstead, it’s the idea that the combination of these things and more — deals that show the close ties between a family whose patriarch oversees the US government and a region whose leaders are fond of currying favor through money and lavish gifts — could cause the United States to show preferential treatment to Middle Eastern leaders when it comes to American affairs of state.\nBefore Trump began his visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, his sons Eric and Donald Jr. had already traveled the Middle East extensively in recent weeks. They were drumming up business for The Trump Organization, which they are running in their father’s stead while he’s in the White House.\nEric Trump announced plans for an 80-story Trump Tower in Dubai, the UAE’s largest city. He also attended a recent cryptocurrency conference there with Zach Witkoff, a founder of the Trump family crypto company, World Liberty Financial, and son of Trump’s do-everything envoy to the Mideast, Steve Witkoff.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“We are proud to expand our presence in the region,” Eric Trump said last month in announcing that Trump Tower Dubai was set to start construction this fall.\nThe presidential visit to the region, as his children work the same part of the world for the family’s moneymaking opportunities, puts a spotlight on Trump’s willingness to embrace foreign dealmaking while in the White House, even in the face of growing concerns that doing so could tempt him to shape US foreign policy in ways that benefit his family’s bottom line.\nEric Trump, Executive VP of The Trump Organization, right, speaks as Co-founder of World Liberty Financial Zach Witkoff, centre, and Founder of TRON Justin Sun look on during Token 2049, a Crypto event, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Thursday, May 1, 2025.

The family is also leasing its brand to two new real estate projects in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia’s capital, in partnership with Dar Global, a London-based luxury real estate developer and subsidiary of private Saudi real estate firm Al Arkan.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Trump Organization has similarly partnered with Dar Global on a Trump Tower set to be built in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and an upcoming Trump International Hotel and luxury golf development in neighboring Oman.\nDuring the crypto conference, a state-backed investment company in Abu Dhabi announced it had chosen USD, World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin, to back a $2 billion investment in Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Critics say that this allows Trump family-aligned interests to essentially take a cut of each dollar invested.\n“I don’t know anything about it,” Trump said when asked by reporters about the transaction on Wednesday.\nThen there’s the Saudi government-backed LIV Golf, which has forged close business relationships with the president and hosted tournaments at Trump’s Doral resort in South Florida.\nThe entrance to the Trump National Doral resort is shown in Doral, Florida, Nov. 20, 2019. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee, File)\n“Given the extensive ties between LIV Golf and the PIF, or between Trump enterprises more generally and the Gulf, I’d say there’s a pretty glaring conflict of interest here,” said Jon Hoffman, a research fellow in defense and foreign policy at the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute. He was referring to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which has invested heavily in everything from global sports giants to video game maker Nintendo with the aim of diversifying the kingdom’s economy beyond oil.\nTrump said he did not talk about LIV Golf during his visit to Saudi Arabia.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe president announced in January a $20 billion investment for US data centers promised by DAMAC Properties, an Emirati company led by billionaire Dubai developer Hussain Sajwani. Trump bills that as benefiting the country’s technological and economic standing rather than his family business. But Sajwani was a close business partner of Trump and his family long before the 2016 election.\nWhite House bristles at conflict of interest concerns\nAsked before he left for the Middle East if Trump might use the trip to meet with people tied to his family’s business, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it was “ridiculous” to “suggest that President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit.”\n“The president is abiding by all conflict of interest laws,” she said.\nUS President Donald Trump is greeted by Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani as he arrives on Air Force One at Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar, May 14, 2025. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\nAdministration officials have brushed off such concerns about the president’s policy decisions bleeding into the business interests of his family by noting that Trump’s assets are in a trust managed by his children. A voluntary ethics agreement released by The Trump Organization also bars the firm from striking deals directly with foreign governments.\nBut that same agreement still allows deals with private companies abroad. In Trump’s first term, the organization released an ethics pact prohibiting deals with both foreign governments and foreign companies.\nThe president, according to the second-term ethics agreement, isn’t involved in any day-to-day decision-making for the family business. But his political and corporate brands remain inextricably linked.\n“The president is a successful businessman,” Leavitt said, “and I think, frankly, that it’s one of the many reasons that people reelected him back to this office.”\nTimothy P. Carney, senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said he doesn’t want to see US foreign policy being affected by Trump’s feelings about how other countries have treated his family’s business.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Even if he’s not running the company, he profits when the company does well,” Carney said. “When he leaves the White House, the company is worth more, his personal wealth goes up.”\nPromises of US investment shaped Trump’s trip\nHis family business aside, the president wasn’t shy about saying he’d shape the itinerary of his first extended overseas trip on quid pro quo.\nTrump’s first stop was Saudi Arabia, just as during his first term. He picked the destination after he said the kingdom had pledged to spend $1 trillion on US companies over four years. The White House has since announced that the actual figure is $600 billion. How much of that will actually be new investment — or come to fruition — remains to be seen.\nUS President Donald Trump speaks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman before posing for a family picture with Gulf leaders during a gathering of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in Riyadh on May 14, 2025.

Just a month earlier, Trump had said that Sajwani had tried to make a $2 billion deal with him, “And I turned it down.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“I didn’t have to turn it down, because as you know, I have a no-conflict situation because I’m president,” Trump said then.\nThis January, there was a beaming Sajwani standing triumphantly by Trump’s side at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, to announce DAMAC’s investment in US data centers.\n“It’s been amazing news for me and my family when he was elected in November,” Sajwani said. “For the last four years, we’ve been waiting for this moment.”"}

This proposal envisions the release of as many as half of the remaining living hostages in exchange for a weekslong ceasefire, during which Israel would agree to hold talks regarding the terms of an end to the war without committing up front to such a result.\nHamas has pushed back on this framework, insisting on guarantees that the war will end before it releases additional hostages. It has pointed to Israel’s refusal to hold talks on a permanent ceasefire earlier this year, even though it had agreed to do so as part of the ceasefire inked in January, which collapsed after its first stage in March.\nThe terror group has proposed releasing all of the hostages at once in exchange for an end to the war, but Netanyahu has rejected this trade, arguing that it would leave Hamas in power. Successive polls have indicated that the premier is out of step with the majority of Israelis who back such a framework.

To receive these Editor’s Notes as they’re released, join the ToI Community here.\nNobody had doubted US Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff’s immense personal commitment to securing the release of all the hostages from Hamas captivity in Gaza.\nBut he has proved it multiple times in the past few days. He oversaw the indirect contacts with Hamas that secured the release of the last living hostage with American citizenship, 21-year-old IDF soldier Edan Alexander. He flew to Israel to greet Alexander on his release on Monday, went to visit him and his family in the hospital on Tuesday, and put him on the phone with US President Donald Trump in Riyadh and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nExtraordinarily, he gave Alexander the Star of David necklace that his own son Andrew used to wear before his tragic death in 2011 and that he has reportedly worn himself ever since, and told the freed hostage that he “would be doing a great honor to my son if you keep wearing this.”\nHe and Trump’s hostages envoy Adam Boehler then spent over an hour and a half meeting with families of the remaining 58 hostages still held by Hamas, reiterating the Trump administration’s commitment to getting them all freed. Relative after relative emerged from the meeting with a little of their 586 days of agony eased. “It was a calming meeting,” Meirav Gilboa-Dalal, whose son Guy is among the living hostages, said on Wednesday morning. “We met a man who understands our pain.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nIn an audio clip from the meeting, Witkoff can be heard saying that if he cannot facilitate a diplomatic solution to the hostage crisis, “it will be one of the worst failures that I can ever endure in my life.”\nUS Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, left, greets freed hostage Edan Alexander at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center on May 13, 2025. (Office of the Special Envoy to the Middle East/X)\nWitkoff is in Doha right now attempting to arrange precisely such a solution, on behalf of a president who keeps restating that the US is determined to secure the release of all the hostages. Netanyahu has dispatched a delegation, too, but reportedly with little room for maneuver in negotiations. The prime minister said on Tuesday that were Hamas to offer “to release 10 more” living hostages, that would be “fine. We’ll take them… But there will be no situation where we stop the war.\n“A temporary ceasefire — fine. But we’re going all the way,” he stressed. “In the coming days, we’ll go in with full force to complete the operation. Completing the operation means subduing Hamas. It means destroying Hamas.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nWitkoff on Tuesday hailed Netanyahu’s crucial role in the process that enabled Alexander’s release, assuring the prime minister in a phone conversation that the way he “allowed the negotiations to operate” was “in large part the reason that Edan is home with his family today.” And while Trump has been saying he is working to get the Gaza war ended “as quickly as possible,” he has reportedly not been directly pressing Netanyahu to do so in order to secure the freedom of the remaining hostages — a Hamas condition that Netanyahu has repeatedly made clear he will not accept, because it would mean Hamas surviving, rebuilding, and preparing to attack again.\nBut the US president, as he is proving almost minute by minute in his current fast-paced Middle East trip, is an insistent deal-maker. And whether he’s still broadly empathetic to Netanyahu’s concerns or not particularly bothered by some of them, he’s moving ahead on a whole range of vital regional issues without including Israel on his regional itinerary, without arranging for an Israeli presence at his critical meetings, and without heeding Israeli concerns in an expanding number of his agreements.\nDeals that Israel needed to influence\nBefore setting out on his trip, Trump signed a truce with the Houthis two days after they launched a missile that struck Ben Gurion Airport, prompting foreign airlines to flee.\nUS President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, center, pose for a photo at the King Abdulaziz International Conference Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. (Alex Brandon/AP)\nHe dramatically deepened US-Saudi relations, with Israel out of the loop — telling Saudi leaders on Tuesday that while it is his dream for them to join the Abraham Accords with Israel, “you’ll do it in your own time.” Left unspoken was his recognition that Saudi Arabia will not normalize ties with an Israeli government, under Netanyahu, that refuses to set out even a theoretical pathway to Palestinian statehood.\nHe signed an unprecedentedly large arms deal with Riyadh, worth some $142 billion, doubtless to Jerusalem’s dismay (especially if Israel’s air supremacy is undermined). And he is reportedly discussing a deal regarding the Saudis’ desire for a civil nuclear program, which opposition leader Yair Lapid warned on Wednesday would trigger a Middle East nuclear race.\nHe is determined to seal a deal with Iran that, given the US zig-zagging on whether this will require the destruction of all of the regime’s nuclear facilities, has Jerusalem in panic mode.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOver objections from Jerusalem, he’s lifted all sanctions on a Syrian leadership that Israel understandably regards as a terrorist regime unless or until proven otherwise, and asked President Ahmed al-Sharaa to normalize relations with Israel and join the Abraham Accords.\nAs I write, he’s just arrived in Qatar, the Hamas-funding, Hamas-hosting mediator that’s allegedly been paying some of Netanyahu’s aides to lobby on its behalf, and that Trump has insisted is “absolutely trying to help” resolve the hostage-war crisis.\nEvery one of these moves has vast implications for Israeli security, economy and the daily well-being of its people. Any Israeli government would have tried to influence and amend Trump’s rapid deal-making steps toward the Houthis, the Syrians, the Saudis and the Iranians. But Israel has been largely marginalized as Trump has advanced them.\nSaudi crown prince as America’s strongest partner\nIt was being speculated in Jerusalem on Tuesday evening that Trump is angry with Netanyahu for having sought to push him toward a military strike on Iran, when he has been advocating diplomacy. It was also being suggested that Trump has concluded that Israel is simply no longer as central to American interests in the region.\nOpposition leader Lapid argued that Netanyahu had denied Israel a seat in Riyadh because of the far-right-driven policies of his coalition. “Netanyahu had two options,” said Lapid on Wednesday afternoon. “Either to do something in Khan Younis for the sixth time, or to be in Riyadh — to sit at the head of a table in Saudi Arabia and be part of agreements on a scale we’ve never known, bringing historic change to the Middle East. And he chose a military operation in Khan Younis” — targeting Hamas’s Gaza leader Mohammad Sinwar.\n“I’m in favor of eliminating the leaders of Hamas,” Lapid went on, referring to Tuesday’s IDF strike, “but for the national interest, we had to be in Saudi Arabia. And we’re not in Saudi Arabia because [Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners Bezalel] Smotrich and [Itamar] Ben Gvir won’t allow it. (The two party leaders insisted on March’s return to war in Gaza, after only the first of the three envisaged phases of the hostage-ceasefire deal finalized by Witkoff in January, and they are even more adamant than Netanyahu in their opposition to any notion of Palestinian statehood.) Said Lapid: “This is causing harm for generations and harm to our relations with the Americans.”\nFor now, with Trump and Netanyahu’s Israel, it appears to be less a case of “he’s not that into you,” and more a case of “I’m moving ahead, with or without you.” With this trip, Trump is soaringly elevating the Gulf states, and that, by definition, means Israel’s regional importance is reduced in the president’s considerations.\n“The transformation that has occurred under the leadership of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed [Bin Salman] has been truly extraordinary,” the president enthused of Saudi Arabia in his main address on Tuesday night, calling the crown prince the US’s strongest partner. “We have great partners in the world, but we have none stronger and nobody like the gentleman that’s right before me,” Trump said of Bin Salman, looking at the crown prince. “He’s your greatest representative… I like him too much… Great guy.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nImplicit in Trump’s admiration for progress in the Gulf is a demotion of Israel as the go-to regional cutting-edge powerhouse, the prime innovator, the tech pioneer, the smart destination for investment. Right now, you can barely even fly here.\nNot at the table\nIt is not clear how all this will affect Steve Witkoff’s efforts in Doha. Gilboa-Delal said Wednesday that the envoy told the families the US can’t decide for Israel on the terms it will accept to bring back hostages. But the US president has untold military, diplomatic and economic leverage he can bring to bear should he choose to.\nThe fact is that Trump is forging ahead with a whole slew of deals and alliances radically impacting Israel — and in so doing, he is already determining core aspects of Israel’s security and geopolitical future.\nHe said on the plane to Qatar that the US having good ties with the Gulf states “is very good for Israel.” Potentially, that is true, but only if the Israeli leadership proves capable of utilizing those ties. The longer Israel is not seated at the main table alongside the US president, metaphorically and literally, the narrower Israel’s room for maneuver."}

He said the foundation would not share any personally identifiable information of aid recipients with Israel.\nWood also asked in the letter for the IDF to “identify and deconflict sufficient locations in northern Gaza capable of hosting GHF-operated secure distribution sites that can be made operational within thirty days.”\nPalestinians evacuate after the Israeli army issued an evacuation warning for several schools and a hospital in Gaza City’s Rimal neighborhood, Wednesday, May 14, 2025.

However, a GHF memo distributed to potential donor countries and organizations included names of several individuals it claimed would sit on its board, even though they had never agreed to do so, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\nThe GHF statement did not address all of the criticism and unanswered questions that the international community has about the group, including who would fund the work and how much involvement the US, Israel or any other government or military would have in controlling life-saving aid for Palestinian civilians.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMohammed Hanieh, a thirteen-year-old Palestinian boy who his family says suffers from malnutrition, stands in front of a mirror at his family home in the Bureij refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip on April 12, 2025.

I got angry, but they [Israel] don’t depend on us, they depend on American weapons,” he added.\nIsrael has effectively sealed off the Gaza Strip since early March, when it resumed its military campaign against Hamas following the collapse of a hostage release and ceasefire deal during which thousands of aid trucks entered the enclave.\nA Palestinian boy salvages bread from a makeshift bakery hit in Israeli strikes at the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip on May 8, 2025. (Eyad BABA / AFP)\nIsrael has said that the Hamas terror group stole much of the aid entering the territory, using it to supply its members and maintain control over the population, and therefore Israel won’t allow aid in until it puts in place a system giving it control over the distribution. Jerusalem also justifies the aid blockade as a necessary tool to pressure Hamas to release the 58 hostages still being held in the Strip.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMacron emphasized on Tuesday that he had visited the border between Egypt and Gaza earlier this year, where he saw that “all the aid that France and other countries deliver” is “blocked by the Israelis.”\n“This is an unacceptable humanitarian tragedy,” he said. He noted, though ,that “it is not up to a president of the republic to say ‘this is a genocide’ but rather to historians.”\nA global food-security analysis organization assessed on Monday that the overwhelming majority of Gaza’s population is at risk of famine in the coming five months due to Israel’s ongoing blockade.\nIsrael said in response that “even according to the IPC’s own analysis,” there is currently no famine in Gaza, and noted that previous IPC projections about impending famine have “repeatedly failed to materialize.”\nWhile Macron visited Israel in October 2023 to express support for Israel after the Hamas attack, France has increasingly pressed Israel to end the war in Gaza, and the relationship has became strained amid growing French criticism.\nLast year, Netanyahu and Macron exchanged barbs after the French leader reportedly told his cabinet that “Mr. Netanyahu must not forget that his country was created by a decision of the UN.” The Israeli leader hit back that “it was not the UN resolution that established the State of Israel, but rather the victory achieved in the War of Independence with the blood of heroic fighters, many of whom were Holocaust survivors — including from the Vichy regime in France.”\nAnd last month, Macron said that France would recognize a Palestinian state within months, which Netanyahu denounced as a “huge prize for terror.” The prime minister’s often incendiary son, Yair Netanyahu, responded to Macron on X by writing “Screw you!” after which his father said that while his son was entitled to his “personal opinion,” the tone he used was “unacceptable to me.”\nTimes of Israel staff contributed to this report."}

He still faces a warrant for his arrest on terrorism charges in Iraq, and the US once offered $10 million for information about his whereabouts because of his links to al-Qaida.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn 2011, Sharaa came back to his home country, where he led the branch of al-Qaida that was known as the Nusra Front.

In February, ICC President Judge Tomoko Akane said that the sanctions “constitute serious attacks against the Court’s States Parties, the rule of law based international order and millions of victims.”\nOrder targets chief prosecutor\nThe February order bans Khan and other non-Americans among the ICC’s 900 staff members from entering the United States. It also threatens any person, institution or company with fines and prison time if they provide Khan with “financial, material, or technological support.”\nThe sanctions are hampering work on a broad array of investigations, not just the one into Israel’s leaders.\nThe ICC, for example, had been investigating atrocities in Sudan and had issued arrest warrants for former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir on charges that include genocide. That probe has ground to a halt even as reports mount of new atrocities in Sudan, according to an attorney representing an ICC prosecutor who is fighting the sanctions in US courts.

(Omar Havana/AP)\nOne reason the court has been hamstrung is that it relies heavily on contractors and non-governmental organizations. Those businesses and groups have curtailed work on behalf of the court because they were concerned about being targeted by US authorities, according to current and former ICC staffers.\nMicrosoft, for example, cancelled Khan’s email address, forcing the prosecutor to move to Proton Mail, a Swiss email provider, ICC staffers said. His bank accounts in his home country of the United Kingdom have been blocked.\nMicrosoft did not respond to a request for comment.\nStaffers at a non-governmental organization that plays an integral role in the court’s efforts to gather evidence and find witnesses said the group has transferred money out of US bank accounts because they fear it might be seized by the Trump administration.\nSenior leadership at two other US-based human rights organizations told the AP that their groups have stopped working with the ICC. A senior staffer at one told the AP that employees have even stopped replying to emails from court officials out of fear of triggering a response from the Trump administration.\nThe cumulative effect of such actions has led ICC staffers to openly wonder whether the organization can survive the Trump administration, according to ICC officials who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal.\nSaid one such official: “It’s hard to see how the court makes it through the next four years.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) speaks in a video statement on November 12, 2024.

Of those, 57, over half of whom are believed dead, are still in captivity, plus the body of a soldier held for the past decade.\nCoping with dark humor\nInside the court, staffers have been coping with dark humor, joking about how they cannot even loan Khan a pen or risk appearing on the US radar.\nThis is not the first time the ICC has drawn Trump’s ire. In 2020, the former Trump administration sanctioned Khan’s predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, and one of her deputies over the court’s investigation into alleged crimes committed in Afghanistan while the United States military was operating in the country.\nADVERTISEMENT\nUS president Joe Biden rescinded the sanctions when he took office several months later.\nA Palestinian man stands next to a truck carrying UNICEF aid supplies outside a shopping mall in Gaza City on May 12, 2025.

Earlier this week Iverson, the lawyer investigating genocide in Sudan, won temporary protection from prosecution but if other US citizens at the court want a similar assurance, they would have to bring their own complaint.\nMeanwhile, the court is facing an increasing lack of cooperation from countries normally considered to be its staunchest supporters.\nThe ICC has no enforcement apparatus of its own and relies on member states. In the last year, three countries – including two in the European Union – have refused to execute warrants issued by the court.\nThe renewed assault from the Trump administration comes as the court was already facing internal challenges. Last year, just weeks before Khan announced he was requesting arrest warrants for the Israeli officials, two court staff reported the British barrister had harassed a female aide, according to reporting by the Associated Press.\nKhan has categorically denied the accusations that he groped and tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship. A United Nations investigation is underway, and Khan has since been accused of retaliating against staff who supported the woman, including demoting several people he felt were critical of him."}

On one hand, Jews must obviously respect the laws of their countries,” Freilich said. “On the other hand, there has been a policy until now of the government turning a blind eye to this issue. The problem is not that brit milah is not allowed; it’s that there needs to be a clearer law about who can perform the procedure. We need to work together to find a solution.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nEuropean Jewish Association chairman Rabbi Menachem Margolin condemned the raids, calling them part of a larger campaign of intimidation against Jewish religious figures in Belgium.\n“Following the ban on ritual slaughter [in a 2019 law that requires that animals be stunned before they can be slaughtered for food], the harassment of mohels represents a further red line and a clear warning sign to Belgian Jews and the Belgian government,” Margolin said. “Any restriction on circumcision in Belgium would send a clear message to Belgian Jews that they are not welcome in the country.”\nBelgian MP Michael Freilich speaking to an audience in a synagogue in Belgium. (Courtesy)\nCutting under sharp scrutiny\nProsecutors in Antwerp, where most of Belgium’s approximately 30,000 Jews live, have been investigating illegal circumcisions since a renegade member of the Jewish community filed a series of complaints.\nIn November 2023, Rabbi Moshe Aryeh Friedman, an anti-Zionist activist from New York living in Antwerp, complained to police that six mohels were endangering children by using a controversial custom known as metzitzah b’peh in the circumcision process.\nThe practice involves mohels using their lips to suck blood from the penises of babies on whom they’d performed the Jewish ritual.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe controversial custom is thought to have caused the death of at least one child in New York in 2012 from herpes. Another outbreak among infants of Haredi families in New York occurred in 2017 and was attributed to metzitzah b’peh.\nThen, in September 2024, Friedman informed police that circumcisions were being performed without legal approvals, and a local television station reported on the issue, stoking local concern.\n“The only reason this is happening now is because of Friedman,” Freilich said. “That doesn’t mean it would never have happened, but he made it go much faster.”\nUnlicensed circumcisions are under increased scrutiny in Europe. Last summer, authorities in Ireland arrested a rabbi from London for allegedly performing circumcision without required medical credentials in what may be the first case in modern Europe of a rabbi arrested in connection with a brit milah.\nCircumcision is relatively uncommon among the general population of Europe, with only 10-20% of males having gone under the knife, compared to over 70% in the United States.\nMuslims generally undergo circumcision at a hospital, not in a religious ceremony, so the legislation is primarily a Jewish issue.\nMost countries do not have any specific legislation regarding circumcision, allowing the Jewish ritual to continue as a religious freedom without intervening, Freilich explained. Only Germany has a law specifically allowing non-medical practitioners to conduct the brit milah under appropriate medical and hygienic conditions.\nFreilich hopes to work with other European governments to adopt similar legislation allowing circumcision. He is also trying to encourage the EU to recognize certified mohels, he said."}

The documentary was pulled after it emerged that its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a senior Hamas official.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Whilst I strongly believe in the importance of speaking out on humanitarian issues, including the tragedy unfolding in Gaza, I also know that how we do so matters,” he said in his apology Wednesday.\nThough Lineker is leaving his role at “Match of the Day,” he has signed a contract extension that will see him host the national broadcaster’s coverage of the FA Cup through to 2026 as well as next year’s World Cup tournament in North America. He has for years been the BBC’s highest-paid star.\nPrior to Lineker’s apology, the BBC’s director-general Tim Davie said the broadcaster’s reputation is “held by everyone and when someone makes a mistake, it costs us.”\nHe added: “And I think we absolutely need people to be the exemplars of BBC values and follow our social media policies, simple as that.”\nThe Campaign Against Antisemitism has urged Davie to sack Lineker, who is also the co-founder of the hugely successful “Goalhanger” podcasts, makers of the popular “The Rest is History” series and its spin-offs about politics, football, entertainment and money.\n“As the BBC’s highest-paid presenter and owner of a major media enterprise, maybe he knows exactly what he’s doing,” a spokesperson for the organization said. “Having looked the other way until now, at this point, it is clear that Mr. Lineker’s continued association with the BBC is untenable. He must go.”"}

The Princeton lab, which tracks political violence, first flagged the man’s video with the library after seeing it on the social network X.\nThe researcher, who requested anonymity owing to the nature of the group’s work, described the book selection as “something that you would expect of someone who is going into the library and trying to get books about Jewish authors and the Holocaust and everything.” In addition, the man had also burned books related to Black and LGBTQ topics.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“I think the act of targeting these materials, burning them, carries specific threatening connotations with it,” the researcher noted.\nRabbi Robert Nosanchuk speaks at an interfaith press conference condemning a man’s recent burning of books on Jewish history and other topics, Beachwood, Ohio, May 12, 2025. (WKYC Cleveland/ Screenshot via YouTube via JTA)\nThe Princeton lab had first seen the video on an account affiliated with the white-supremacist group White Lives Matter Ohio, which appeared to have since removed it. Local media also reported that material related to the burnings had made its way to the social network Gab, which is popular with extremists. JTA could not independently locate the video; local clergy told media they were deliberately not circulating it, in an effort to tamp down on its influence.\nThe book-burning incident appeared to be an unusual local manifestation of a simmering culture war over books reflecting diversity, one that has occasionally ensnared Jewish books and has lately been folded into the Trump administration’s push against diversity initiatives.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to local media descriptions of the police report, the man burned around 100 books in total that he checked out across multiple trips to the library in April, including other books “on topics including Jewish history, African American history and LGBTQ education,” which he obtained after telling librarians he had a son in the LGBTQ community. Multiple spokespeople for the Beachwood police department declined to provide the report to JTA.\n“The Beachwood Police Department is actively investigating this incident,” police chief Dan Grispino said in a statement. “Our department stands against antisemitism and all acts of bias-motivated crimes. We are committed to vigorously investigating  and prosecuting any hate-motivated incidents within the City of Beachwood. Our priority is to maintain a community that can thrive without the fear of threats of intimidation or violence.”\nA spokesperson for the library also declined to provide additional information on which books were targeted, citing an Ohio state law that forbids the release of any patron information. If the man is determined to have committed a crime, the library said, the police may make the information public. He could potentially be charged with destroying city property if the books he checked out are found to have matched the books he burned.\nThe spokesperson also told JTA the library would be replacing all of the burned books. In addition, local residents have donated upwards of 1,000 books to the library in response to the incident.\nThat surge of donations was a notable outcome for the Princeton lab, whose researcher said they appreciated how local clergy have led the community in coming together to reject acts of hate.\n“The backfire of, for every one book that’s stolen, 10 will be donated, is really encouraging,” they said."}

That means Smotrich would have to prove that Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University had themselves funded their students’ Nakba commemorations.\nKisch has previously clashed with university heads over their threats to go on strike if the government proceeded with steps to weaken the judiciary.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraeli universities have suspended Arab students over social media posts seen as supporting the October 7 Hamas onslaught.

Accordingly, the foundation said Israel has agreed “to allow the flow of transitional aid into Gaza under existing mechanisms” until the construction of SDSs is complete.\nGHF said it secured the concession from Israel after it sent a letter to the Israeli government that outlined the organization’s requirements for operation.

UN-backed aid organizations currently operating in Gaza issued a joint statement earlier this month saying they would not join the effort, arguing that Israel’s conditions on GHF would leave vulnerable populations without humanitarian assistance.\nHumanitarian workers criticized the initial plan to have just four distribution sites in Gaza, along with other criteria only allowing one family representative chosen by Israel to pick up a roughly 40-lb box of assistance once every two weeks. They also argued that the requirement to then carry the box of aid long distances still exposed recipients to Hamas looting.\nFormer Marine Sgt.

Nonetheless, the IDF has warned the political echelon that the Strip is on the brink of starvation, the Israeli official told The Times of Israel.\nIn his letter to the Israeli government, Wood sought to address some of the concerns. He said the foundation would not share any personally identifiable information of aid recipients with Israel.\nWood also asked in the letter for the IDF to “identify and deconflict sufficient locations in northern Gaza capable of hosting GHF-operated secure distribution sites that can be made operational within thirty days.”\nPalestinians evacuate after the Israeli army issued an evacuation warning for several schools and a hospital in Gaza City’s Rimal neighborhood, Wednesday, May 14, 2025.

The IDF has not yet confirmed whether Sinwar, the younger brother of former Hamas leader and October 7 terror mastermind Yahya Sinwar, was killed in the strike.\nHamas authorities claimed that strikes killed over 100 people on Thursday and at least 80 on Wednesday.

From the moment they started to talk about him, they gave him more food so that he would gain weight.”\nYnet also reported, citing conversations Alexander had with others since his release on Monday, that following Trump’s inauguration, the freed hostage was moved to a “VIP tunnel” with senior Hamas officials in order to both serve as a human shield and provide him with further protection due to his American citizenship.\nThis echoes comments Alexander reportedly made during his phone conversation with Trump on Tuesday. According to Channel 12 news, Alexander, when asked by the US president how Hamas had treated him, answered: “Since you got elected, my conditions improved dramatically. There are tons of cameras and people around me right now — I can’t share much at the moment. We’ll talk in private.”\nAlthough reports had circulated that Alexander might fly to Doha on Wednesday to meet with Trump, his family said following his release that he required further medical treatment before leaving the country, and expects to meet the US president in Washington in the future.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nAlexander, 21, the last living hostage with American citizenship, was freed from Gaza on Monday, after 584 days in captivity, following indirect talks between the US and Hamas.

Hamas kidnapped him from his base near the Gaza border community of Nirim, known as the White House post, during its October 7 onslaught.\nHe is the first male IDF soldier to be freed by Hamas since the start of the war. The other hostages with US citizenship still remaining in the Strip have all been declared dead by Israeli officials — soldiers Itay Chen and Omer Neutra and married couple Judith Weinstein and Gadi Haggai.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTrump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, pressed heavily on Hamas and Israel to agree to a January ceasefire that went into effect even before Trump took office. Pressure and threats from Trump are considered to have played a significant role in ultimately bringing the deal to fruition after more than a year of stalled talks.\nDuring that deal, Hamas freed 30 hostages, including five Thai nationals, and returned the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives. Two of those freed, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Keith Siegel, also had US citizenship, and Siegel met with Trump in the White House in March.\nFreed hostage Keith Siegel shakes hands with US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House on March 5, 2025.

He also described the terror he experienced when the IDF would strike Gaza, destroying buildings.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The strikes and bombs made him think that every moment was about to be his last one,” she said. “Edan, my hero, you returned from the horror. But other hostages are still living through that threat, they are still living in that hell. My heart has returned to beating, but they still need to return home.”\nAccording to the Channel 12 news network, Alexander was severely beaten during the early period of his captivity, and he returned to Israel with flea bites and bruises all over his body.\nIsrael believes that 58 hostages are still being held by terror groups in Gaza, including 35 confirmed dead by Israeli authorities and another three about whom Israel has expressed severe concern. The 35 bodies include that of an IDF soldier who was killed in 2014."}

This proposal envisions the release of as many as half of the remaining living hostages in exchange for a weekslong ceasefire, during which Israel would agree to hold talks regarding the terms of an end to the war without committing up front to such a result.\nHamas has pushed back on this framework, insisting on guarantees that the war will end before it releases additional hostages. It has pointed to Israel’s refusal to hold talks on a permanent ceasefire earlier this year, even though it had agreed to do so as part of the ceasefire inked in January, which collapsed after its first stage in March.\nThe terror group has proposed releasing all of the hostages at once in exchange for an end to the war, but Netanyahu has rejected this trade, arguing that it would leave Hamas in power. Successive polls have indicated that the premier is out of step with the majority of Israelis who back such a framework. But Netanyahu is also facing pressure from his far-right coalition partners, who have threatened to collapse the government if he were to end the war in exchange for the remaining 58 hostages — between 20 and 23 of whom are believed to still be alive.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nWhile Netanyahu has stuck to the “Witkoff proposal” from earlier this year, the Israeli official said the US envoy has moved away from this proposal and is instead pushing frameworks that more definitively include a permanent end to the war, while removing Hamas from power in Gaza.\nWhite House special envoy Steve Witkoff speaks with journalists after a signing ceremony between President Donald Trump and Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani at the Amiri Diwan in Doha, Qatar, May 14, 2025. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\nWitkoff held a phone call with Netanyahu for over two hours on Wednesday during which the US envoy sought to push the prime minister toward his new framework, but did not make significant progress, the Israeli official said.\nThe Arab official said Hamas has indicated willingness to show flexibility on the issue of disarmament if Israel agrees to end the war and withdraw its forces from Gaza. The terror group has already said it was prepared to transfer governing power to an independent committee of Palestinian technocrats.\nADVERTISEMENT\nEgyptian and Qatari mediators have also been pushing Hamas to accept an initial ceasefire of several months — longer than the 45-day ceasefire that Netanyahu has said it is prepared to accept — that includes assurances from the mediators that they will ensure Israel remains at the negotiating table during that time to hash out the terms of a permanent end to the war and that it doesn’t resume fighting in the meantime, the Arab official said.\nQatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari appeared to confirm this effort, telling the local Al Araby Al Jadeed newspaper that the mediators’ current goal is to reach an initial ceasefire that is longer than the truce from earlier this year, which lasted six weeks, and provides an opportunity for the parties to reach additional agreements.\n“There are still challenges, but President Trump’s visit has given momentum to the negotiations,” al-Ansari said.\nAl-Ansari said that the new talks in Doha revolve around a US-backed proposal for an extended truce, the release of the remaining hostages and talks about the future of the Gaza Strip.\nLater Wednesday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told CNN that Israel’s sustained airstrikes this week send the signal that it is not interested in negotiating a ceasefire\nRelatives and supporters of the Gaza hostages call for the US to intervene for their release, at a protest in front of the US embassy branch office in Tel Aviv, on May 13, 2025, (Tomer Neuberg/Flash90)\nAmong the various meetings held in Qatar on Wednesday was a sit-down between Witkoff and senior Qatari negotiators, in the presence of several hostage families. The meeting was said by Al Jazeera to have lasted for some two-and-a-half hours.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWitkoff was in the Gulf state along with Trump, who made Qatar the second stop on a three-country tour that started in Saudi Arabia on Monday and will end in the United Arab Emirates on Friday.\nUS denies direct Witkoff-Hamas meeting\nMeanwhile, an American source denied an Arabic media report that Witkoff had met directly with senior Hamas officials.\nWhile no major breakthroughs were made by late Wednesday night, the Israeli and Arab officials said they expect US pressure to intensify over the next 48 hours.\nAn Israeli negotiating team made up of the former Shin Bet deputy chief, Netanyahu’s diplomatic adviser Ophir Falk and the government’s hostage point-man Gal Hirsch remains in Doha for continued discussions, though the Israeli official said their mandate is very limited. Witkoff understood this when he chose to pick up the phone and speak directly with Netanyahu on Wednesday, the official added.\nDuring a meeting Witkoff held with hostage families on Tuesday in Tel Aviv, one of the participants was recorded asking the US envoy why the US wasn’t pressuring Netanyahu to end the war. Witkoff could be heard responding that Israel is a sovereign country and that Washington wouldn’t force Jerusalem to make such a decision.\nUS Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and US hostages envoy Adam Boehler (center left and right) meet with relatives of hostages held in Gaza, in Tel Aviv, May 13, 2025.

As a police commander, he didn’t have to do it, but he was full of morals and made other police officers come and spend time with the youth and teach them a different way.”\nAt a memorial ceremony for him in Or Akiva in February, his mother added, “Dan instilled in us that anything is possible, that we can learn the language of unity, love, friendship, and togetherness.”\nBrother Ofir said, “Dan was a patriot from birth who loved helping everyone and was always the first one wherever help was needed.”\n“Dan left behind a clear and pure legacy of Zionism, love for his country, and dedication, which we will hold in our hearts and hand down in his name to future generations forever,” said his friend, Ori, at a memorial ceremony.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

She called her friend who was also fleeing and told her to avoid that area, saving her life, he said.\nEldad said Gili kept texting the family until around 9:15 a.m., telling them that she was hiding near the partygrounds, as gunshots closed in around them. Not long after, she stopped answering.\nHe said he immediately headed south toward the Gaza border to search for her, bypassing police barricades and even embedding with army convoys but was unable to find her. Three days later, the family was informed that her body had been found.\nShe was buried on October 11 near Modiin. She is survived by her parents, Orna and Eldad, and her older sister, Adi.\nHer parents told La’Isha magazine that Gili, a longtime scout leader, spent a year volunteering for national service, working during the day with children with special needs, and in the evening meeting with young American Jews to instill them with Zionist pride.\nShe served in the IDF as an artillery instructor, and after her release she set off on a big trip to South America, returning in May 2023. She started working through the scouts as an aide to lone soldiers coming from abroad to ease them through the enlistment process.\nHer parents described her to La’Isha as “a girl of happiness and laughter, joy for life incarnate! Someone eulogized her and said, ‘She wasn’t a ray of light, she was the sun!'”\nhttps://twitter.com/AdamAlbilya/status/1712417915851379095\nFor years she worked and volunteered with the scouts, including leading their delegations overseas.

He is survived by his fiance Roni, his parents, Avivit and Tamir, and his siblings Halel, Tama, Yehuda, Eliya, Hadar and Chana.\nHis family said Amitay loved to always be out in nature, at springs and streams, especially as he struggled in school. He was diagnosed with dysgraphia, completing his high school matriculation exams orally, but began to write and express himself during his years in yeshiva. He was also a talented piano player, his family said, and would arrive home from the army, drop his belongings on the floor and immediately start playing.\nTwo weeks before he was killed, he and Roni got engaged, and were planning their wedding for a few months later. With the start of the war on October 7, the couple decided that they would simply get married the next time Amitay had a break from the army — but they never managed that either.\nHis older sister, Halel, wrote on Instagram ahead of Memorial Day that she wasn’t sure how to memorialize Amitay, “but in my heart you have already taken hold.”\n“You are present in my conversations with myself, you are part of the decisions I make, the things I try to understand,” she wrote. “I feel you with me and I believe that you are here.” During the shiva mourning period, she said, the family heard “what we already knew — how wonderful you were, how calm, sure of yourself, how you achieved what you wanted and did what you believed.”\nAll that, she said, despite his struggles over the years in school and at home, “I remember you searching for your place, fighting for it… but I think you didn’t allow external things to control you. You chose your place for yourself, without outside voices, without bells and whistles.” He was controlled only by “an inner truth.

His face, his heart and every fiber of his being were filled with light. Light and light and light.”\nHis mother, Avivit, told Channel 14 that he was, like his name, “a man of truth, the truth was very important to him.”\nAvivit went on to read from his journal, where he wrote that “the people of Israel are not afraid of anything. And even if we’re at the lowest place, without faith, where everything is superficial, there too God is with us, and we are still his people, and nothing can take down the Jewish people.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

Her family clung to the video as hope she had managed to escape, but after a week of searching, they were informed on October 14 that her body had been identified.

One survivor heard Zemach shout in English: “Please, I’m not your enemy,” before there was more shooting and another grenade was thrown. Hadad, Levi and Mann were also slain alongside him inside the clinic.\nZemach’s funeral was held in Modiin on October 15 and he was laid to rest in Be’eri a day later.

I didn’t say it to him too much.”\nThe kibbutz eulogy noted that Shachar was a dedicated runner and loved to play and watch soccer games — especially Liverpool or Maccabi Haifa — and to travel and hike around the country. He loved sitting around a bonfire and cooking on it, and also always helped to organize the kibbutz outings.\n“His friends said he was the ultimate combination of serious and lighthearted: By day he wore the suit of a CFO, at night he lit a bonfire with the kids, and when they went to sleep he would invite his friends over to smoke hookah,” the eulogy reads. “Shachar was a man with a thirst for life, who loved others, an optimist, brave who saw every challenge in life as an opportunity. This is how we will remember him, and this is how we will continue to talk about him to his children, Ella and Netta.”\nHis mother, Shlomit, told Channel 13, “Shachar was a wonderful kid. As a mom when I gave birth to him, I felt like the happiest person in the world — to be a mom was all of my dreams coming true,” she said.\nShe always felt lucky that all of her children lived nearby in Be’eri, Shlomit said.\n“I was blessed that all my children were around me, I was the hen, I laid chicks, I want all my chicks to be around me,” she said. “And until now they were always nearby.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

Yiftah managed to protect two young women with his body who were wounded inside the dumpster but survived.\nYiftah was considered missing for more than a week until his family was informed on October 15 that his body had been identified.\nThe five childhood friends were buried side by side in the Gezer Regional Cemetery outside Modiin. Yiftah is survived by his parents, Shoshana and Meir, and his siblings Rami, Sivan and Keren.\nYiftah, the youngest in the family, grew up in Azaria, a small community near Ramle. He arrived as a surprise, when his mother was 43 years old, and his older siblings were 21, 19 and 16. In a way, his family said, Yiftah grew up with five parents always watching out for him.\nHe attended high school in Beit Hashmonai, and after graduating, he enlisted in the IDF and served as a combat soldier in the Armored Corps. Following his release, Yiftah began working in event production and specialized in LED lighting, and he planned to soon begin his studies.\nYiftah and his friends loved extreme sports, including ski trips, mountain biking and off-roading. He also loved and played soccer, and he was most known for his love of tea, and how he always liked to sit with friends and sip on a steaming cup of tea and talk about life. In his memory, Wissotzky issued a special line of tea called “Yiftah’s Magic.”\nHis sister, Keren, told the Ynet news site that “Yiftah was — as often is with the youngest — the prince of the house,” noting the large gaps between the siblings.\n“We all raised him together,” she said. “He was connected to all of his siblings in a different way — if it was through cooking with my sister or studying Gemara with my brother. He knew how to reach everyone.”\nKeren said that “Yiftah was an unusually smart guy. He was a big prankster, but anytime Mom would arrive at the school, they would say, ‘The genius’s mom is here.” Keren said that despite their 20-year age gap, “I wouldn’t take any step without seeking his advice and asking his opinion. He was always modest, helped others, we keep hearing more and more stories about him.”\nSpeaking to a local news site, his father, Meir, noted that he was close to 50 when Yiftah was born, “and I would take him to kindergarten or the playground, and I had to make myself fit in with all the other parents who were younger than me.”\nIn school, Meir said, his youngest son “was always smart. He learned everything himself. In the army, he was a combat soldier,” recalling attending his beret march “with great pride.”\nAt just age 27, he said, Yiftah “was a businessman, he worked in event production,” and he sought to take care of his parents: “He always helped,  he didn’t want us to worry about him. He didn’t want to be a burden.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

The screening, held just before the festival’s official opening ceremony, was part of a new day-one tradition for restored films, festival director Thierry Fremaux said before the screening at Cannes’ Debussy Theatre.\nYears in the making, this “Gold Rush” pristinely restores Chaplin’s Tramp to all his downtrodden glory. The 1925 Alaskan frontier comedy may be marking its centenary, but it looks bracingly fresh in the restoration carried out by La Cineteca di Bologna.\n00:00 / 23:33\nThe restoration was more complicated than most because it included an extensive search for any missing footage. In 1942, Chaplin edited the film and re-released it with sound effects, music and narration. That version landed two Oscar nominations, but the restoration sought to get as close to the 1925 original as possible.\nIn “The Gold Rush” Chaplin’s lone prospector ambles through the snowy Alaskan wilds in pursuit less of gold than some food and perhaps companionship. His antic, cliff-dangling struggles make up much of the film’s deft slapstick, but the Little Tramp’s humble, sweet hopes for romance greatly exceed his strike-it-rich ambitions.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nL-R: Comedian Charlie Chaplin, Chief Justice Philip Gibson, of the California Supreme Court, and songwriter Irving Berlin arrive at Federal Court in New York on March 31, 1941, to appear as character witnesses in the income tax evasion trial of movie executive Joseph M.

It envisioned a series of bilateral agreements, including the first US defense treaty in decades that would have provided Saudi Arabia guarantees that Washington would come to its defense if the latter were attacked under certain circumstances.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nSuch a treaty would have required ratification from two-thirds of the Senate, and the Biden administration hoped that folding in an Israel-Saudi normalization deal would help gain support for the package from both sides of the aisle.\nRiyadh has long made clear, however, that such an agreement would require a political horizon for the Palestinians — something that many progressive Democrats would also have demanded in exchange for their support of the “mega deal.”\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, right, welcomes US President Joe Biden to Al-Salam Palace in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, July 15, 2022. (Bandar Aljaloud/Saudi Royal Palace via AP, File)\nThe Biden administration had managed to make significant progress in the series of bilateral agreements with Saudi Arabia — and was slated to begin serious discussions with Riyadh regarding the exact terms of the Palestinian component of the package — when Hamas launched its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe onslaught and ensuing war derailed the normalization effort and Riyadh began to recognize that it would need more concrete steps toward the establishment of a Palestinian state, as solidarity with the Palestinians in Saudi Arabia and the region at large skyrocketed due to the devastating war in Gaza.\nAs the war continued through the end of Biden’s term, Saudi officials began speaking of trying to negotiate smaller bilateral deals with the US that wouldn’t require a normalization deal with Israel. Those weren’t finalized by the time Biden left office, but Trump’s administration has sought to move them forward, reportedly considering a deal that would allow for the establishment of a Saudi civilian nuclear program.\nTrump has also pledged to broker an Israel-Saudi normalization deal, repeatedly asserting that additional countries would quickly join the Abraham Accords. But his remarks Tuesday indicated his recognition that Riyadh won’t be joining as quickly as he may have hoped.\nEnding the Gaza war ASAP\nAt the same time, Trump touted his efforts to “get that [Gaza] war ended as quickly as possible,” in what would remove one of the two key obstacles to Riyadh joining the Abraham Accords.\nPresident Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman pose for a photo at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum at the King Abdulaziz International Conference Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Tuesday, May 13, 2025. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\nTrump also highlighted Monday’s release of American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, whom Hamas freed after 584 days in captivity in a gesture of goodwill to the US, in the hopes that Washington will, in turn, coax Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the war in Gaza.\n“We’ve been working tirelessly to bring back all hostages held by Hamas,” Trump said. Israel agreed to send a negotiating team to Doha on Tuesday at the US’s request, but Netanyahu has reiterated to coalition partners that he only intends to agree to a temporary ceasefire. Hamas has offered to release all remaining 58 hostages at once in exchange for a permanent ceasefire, but Netanyahu has rejected the trade, arguing that it would leave the terror group in power.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTrump also used his speech to stress that “all civilized people must condemn the October 7 atrocities against Israel.”\n“The people of Gaza deserve a much better future, but that will or cannot occur as long as their leaders choose to kidnap, torture and target innocent men, women and children for political ends,” he said.\nThere were several other parts of the speech that indicated daylight between the US and Israel, including on Syria, Iran and broader foreign policy. Trump only mentioned Israel by name one time — as quoted above in reference to Hamas’s October 7, 2023 invasion and massacre — in the over 30-minute address that largely focused on the Middle East.\nMeanwhile, he lavished praise on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, calling him the US’s strongest partner. “One of our great, great partners, no matter who we look to, and we have great partners in the world, but we have none stronger and nobody like the gentleman that’s right before me,” Trump said of Bin Salman, looking at the crown prince. “He’s your greatest representative, greatest representative. And if I didn’t like him, I’d get out of here so fast. You know that don’t you? He knows me well. I do, I like him a lot. I like him too much… Great guy.”\nLifting Syria sanctions at request of MBS and Erdogan\nIn what was arguably his biggest announcement in the address, Trump declared the lifting of all of Washington’s sanctions on Syria.\nA handout picture provided by the Saudi Royal Palace shows Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (C-R) meeting with US President Donald Trump (C-L) in Riyadh on May 13, 2025. (BANDAR AL-JALOUD / Saudi Royal Palace / AFP)\n“I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,” he said, adding that he had made the decision after being pressed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nBin Salman rose to his feet in the front row to applaud the announcement and the rest of the crowd in the Riyadh auditorium followed.\n“The sanctions were brutal and crippling and served a really important function at the time, but now it’s [the new Syrian government’s] time to shine,” Trump said. “So I say, ‘Good luck, Syria.’”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe new US policy would appear to put him at odds with Israel, which has urged a more cautious approach to the new Syrian government led by Ahmed al-Sharaa. Jerusalem has been quietly lobbying the administration and congressional lawmakers to buck the fledgling Islamist government of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in favor of establishing a decentralized series of autonomous ethnic regions, with the southern one bordering Israel being demilitarized.\nThreatening Iran with sanctions, but not a military strike\nTurning to Iran, Trump reiterated his desire to strike a deal with the Islamic Republic through the ongoing nuclear talks. He still threatened to cripple Iran’s economy, but stopped short of raising a potential military strike, as he has done in the past.\nUS President Donald Trump gestures during the Saudi-US investment forum at the King Abdul Aziz International Conference Center in Riyadh on May 13, 2025. (Fayez NURELDINE / AFP)\n“I want to make a deal with Iran… to make your region and the world a safer place,” Trump said. “But if Iran’s leadership rejects this olive branch and continues to attack their neighbors, then we will have no choice but to inflict massive maximum pressure [and] drive Iranian oil exports to zero like I did before.”\n“Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. But with that said, Iran can have a much brighter future,” he added. “This is an offer that will not last forever. The time is right now for them to choose… Things are happening at a very fast pace.”\nShots at ‘neocons’ and ‘interventionalists’\nTrump then took swings at “neocons” and “interventionists” who oppose his foreign policy.\n“It’s crucial for the wider world to know this great transformation [in the Middle East] has not come from Western interventionists, or flying people in beautiful planes giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs,” Trump said.\n“In the end, the so-called nation builders wrecked far more nations than they built and the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves,” he continued.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPresident Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman speak during a meeting at the Royal Palace in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Tuesday, May 13, 2025. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n“The gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called ‘nation builders,’ neocons, or liberal non-profits.\n“Instead, the birth of a modern Middle East has been brought by the people of the region themselves — the people that are right here, the people [who] have lived here all their lives, developing your own sovereign countries, pursuing your own unique visions and charting your own destinies in your own way.”\n“You achieved a modern miracle the Arabian way,” Trump added.\nThe comments reflected the mounting battle between the more pro-Trump isolationist wing of the Republican Party and hawkish conservatives who are more fervent supporters of Israel, with the president making clear in his remarks that he sides with the former camp.\nThe latter group has been critical of US special envoy Steve Witkoff’s efforts to broker a nuclear deal with Iran and US special envoy Adam Boehler’s efforts to negotiate directly with Hamas earlier this year. Trump’s inner circle has ardently defended Witkoff, while Trump himself has kept Boehler on as hostage envoy, despite efforts by hawkish Republicans and senior Israeli officials to sideline him."}

At the time, Prince Mohammed’s reputation had been badly damaged by a US intelligence determination that found he had ordered the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\nBut that dark moment appeared to be a distant memory for the prince as he rubbed elbows with high-profile business executives — including Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk — in front of the cameras and with Trump by his side.\nLater, the crown prince was set to fete Trump with an intimate state dinner at Ad-Diriyah, a UNESCO heritage site that is the birthplace of the first Saudi state and the site of a major development project championed by the crown prince.\nOil production\nSaudi Arabia and fellow OPEC+ nations have already helped their cause with Trump early in his second term by stepping up oil production. Trump sees cheap energy as a key component to lowering costs and stemming inflation for Americans. The Republican president has also made the case that lower oil prices will hasten an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\nADVERTISEMENT\nStorage tanks are seen at the North Jiddah bulk plant, an Aramco oil facility, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 21, 2021 (AP Photo/Amr Nabil)\nBut Saudi Arabia’s economy remains heavily dependent on oil, and the kingdom needs a fiscal break-even oil price of $96 to $98 a barrel to balance its budget. It’s questionable how long OPEC+, of which Saudi Arabia is the leading member, is willing to keep production elevated. The price of a barrel of Brent crude closed Monday at $64.77.\nQatar and UAE next\nTrump picked the kingdom for his first stop because it has pledged to make big investments in the US, but he ended up traveling to Italy last month for Pope Francis’ funeral. Riyadh was the first overseas stop of his first term.\nThe three countries on Trump’s itinerary — Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates — are places where the Trump Organization, run by the president’s two oldest sons, is developing major real estate projects.

Speaking at an investment summit in Riyadh, the president said Tuesday that it is his “dream” for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, though he acknowledged that Riyadh would do so in its own time.\n“It’s my fervent hope, wish and even my dream that Saudi Arabia… will soon be joining the Abraham Accords,” he said.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe poll suggests that many Israelis share that sentiment. When asked whether normalization with Saudi Arabia would strengthen Israel’s security, economy and regional standing, and weaken Iran, 67% of respondents said it would contribute significantly. Another 16% said it would contribute little or not at all, while 17.1% said they didn’t know.\nUS President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman pose for a photo at the King Abdulaziz International Conference Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Tuesday, May 13, 2025. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\nSupport for normalization was also consistent across political lines. Among Israelis who voted for the parties in the government coalition, 60% said they support normalization (compared to 61% of all respondents), and 65% said it would contribute significantly to Israel’s strategic interests (compared to 67% overall).\nThe poll also addressed the impact of Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza on ties with Saudi Arabia and beyond. A majority — 53% — said that occupying and controlling the Gaza Strip would somewhat or greatly harm the chances of reaching an agreement with Saudi Arabia and cooperating with moderate countries in the region. Just 12.8% said it would not harm those efforts, while 34.3% said it would neither help nor hinder them.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA substantial majority — 68.9% — said they would back a Trump-led regional political initiative that included the return of all Israeli hostages, an end to the war in Gaza, normalization with Saudi Arabia, a pathway toward separation from the Palestinians, and the formation of a US-led regional security coalition against Iran. Only 9.7% said no, while 21.5% were neutral.\nUpon publication of the poll, the Coalition for Regional Security — a group of over 100 senior Israeli figures from the military, political, business, and academic sectors — called on the government to act quickly.\n“This survey serves as an urgent wake-up call to the Israeli government: enough with political intransigence — get on board the regional train now,” the group said in a statement.\nDemonstrators protest against the government and for the release of people held hostage in the Gaza Strip outside IDF Headquarters in Tel Aviv, May 10, 2025 (Tomer Neuberg/Flash90)\n“This is the moment to seize the historic opportunity presented by President Trump to reshape the Middle East and strengthen Israel’s security. History will not forgive those who miss the chance to bring regional stability through strategic alliances and courageous partnerships that are forming at this very moment. The Israeli people want this — now the government must say ‘yes’ to President Trump. If we keep hesitating — we will be left behind.”\nDuring his visit in Riyadh, Trump signed a host of economic and bilateral cooperation agreements with Saudi Arabia.\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto Saudi ruler, has already committed to some $600 billion in new Saudi investment in the US, but Trump teased that $1 trillion would be even better. The agreements included a mammoth arms deal described by the White House as the largest “in history” between the allies, worth nearly $142 billion.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTrump also announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria’s new government, after being pressed by bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nThe US president will next travel to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in his first Middle East tour, notably skipping Israel."}

Because this is the only way it could end. For the good of everybody,” he asked in a recording obtained by Haaretz.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“I don’t want to get into it,” Witkoff responded. “We’re not the Israeli government. We don’t disagree. The Israeli government is a sovereign government. They can’t tell us what to do, and we can’t tell them what to do.”\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to end the war in exchange for all of the hostages, arguing that it would leave Hamas in power. He appears to be out of step with the majority of Israelis who back such an exchange, according to repeated polls.\nThe meeting between Witkoff and hostage families came ahead of another round of negotiations in Doha that was slated to start on Wednesday. Netanyahu said Israel may agree to a short-term truce, but will not end the war in Gaza until Hamas is defeated, his office said Tuesday.\n“Eliminating Hamas and freeing all our hostages — these go hand in hand. That’s how we’re doing this,” Netanyahu said Monday night in a meeting with injured reservists from the group “Wounded Soldiers for Victory,” according to a video shared by his office. The premier also told the soldiers that Israel was gearing up to take control of the Strip and was looking for countries to take in Gazans.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, center, meets wounded IDF reservists from the “Wounded Soldiers for Victory” forum, at his office in Jerusalem, May 12, 2025. (Maayan Toaf/GPO)\nThe premier has stressed that negotiations would be conducted with Gaza “under fire” — despite a reported US commitment to the contrary — and that the military’s planned offensive to achieve control of the entire Strip will still go ahead if Hamas does not release more captives first.\nThe negotiations were jump-started by the release on Monday of US-Israeli captive soldier Edan Alexander following indirect talks between Witkoff and Hamas, in which the White House reportedly agreed to the terror group’s request that the US pressure Israel into a ceasefire-hostage deal.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHamas on Tuesday said Netanyahu was “misleading” the public by calling Alexander’s release the result of Israeli military pressure. The terror group said the release was “the result of serious communications with the US administration and the efforts of mediators.”\nUS Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, right, and freed hostage Edan Alexander, second right, speak by phone to US President Donald Trump, alongside Alexander’s family from Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center on May 13, 2025. (Office of the Special Envoy to the Middle East/X)\nAlexander’s release was widely seen as a goodwill gesture to US President Donald Trump, who is due in Doha on Wednesday as part of a state visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The soldier was the last known living US citizen in Hamas captivity, and his release was seen as a goodwill gesture to Trump.\nIn the wake of Alexander’s release, terror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 58 hostages, including 57 of those abducted on October 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed southern Israel to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages, sparking the war in Gaza.\nAlexander and 23 other young men still thought to be alive had been set for release in the second phase of a ceasefire-hostage deal that was struck in January following mediation by Egypt, the US and Qatar. However, the deal’s 42-day first phase expired on March 2 amid Netanyahu’s refusal to negotiate the second phase, which would have required a full IDF withdrawal from Gaza — a red line for his far-right coalition partners.\nNetanyahu at the time demanded Hamas agree to “Witkoff’s framework,” which would have extended the first phase of the ceasefire by some 40 days in return for about half the remaining living hostages. On Monday, as negotiations were set to resume, the premier reportedly told coalition partners that Israel was still committed to the framework, saying the war would continue until Hamas is vanquished.\nWitkoff and Boehler, who on Tuesday visited Alexander at Tel Aviv’s Ichilov Hospital, later told members of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum that Trump remained committed to bringing home all the remaining captives.\n“The president’s not going to tolerate anything other than everybody coming home, and he will be relentless on that pursuit… when people don’t do so well with the United States, we don’t do so well with them,” said Witkoff at the Forum’s Tel Aviv headquarters, according to video released by the group.\nAccording to Channel 12 news, a “small” delegation of hostages’ relatives was also headed to Doha and would meet with both Trump and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman al-Thani. The report did not specify the exact makeup of the delegation, but said the group would be led by Eytan Stibbe, a former fighter pilot, arms dealer and businessman who was part of a private trip to space in 2022.\nAl-Thani, whose country backs Hamas and hosts its politburo, suggested to Trump and Witkoff during a visit to Washington last month that they accept a Hamas-approved proposal to release all the hostages and end the war in Gaza, but was told Washington would accept only a temporary, phased deal, Axios reported Tuesday.\nUS President Donald Trump speaks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during an arrival ceremony at the Royal Terminal of King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. (AP/Alex Brandon)\nUpon returning to Doha, al-Thani encouraged Hamas to make a gesture to Trump to change the US president’s position, according to the report. Shortly afterward, Hamas reached out to Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian-American businessman and Trump supporter, to mediate talks with the US on the proposal, the report said, citing four Israeli, Palestinian and US officials. The existence of this backchannel was first reported by The Times of Israel.\nThe White House subsequently told the terror group that if Alexander were released, the US would pressure Israel to implement a 70- to 90-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of 10 hostages, during which negotiations for a final deal would be held, according to a Palestinian official cited by in the report.\nThe US, Qatar and Egypt would ensure that the war wouldn’t resume throughout the talks, the official added, though the US did not confirm this to Axios.\nFor his part, Trump did not pressure Netanyahu during their phone call Monday to roll back his plans for an expanded ground campaign in Gaza set to begin after Trump’s Middle East visit, Israeli officials told Axios.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNetanyahu: ‘A temporary ceasefire — fine. But we’re going all the way’\nSpeaking to the wounded reservists Monday night, Netanyahu said “the situation has changed,” and vowed that “in the coming days, we’ll go in with full force to complete the operation.”\n“Completing the operation means subduing Hamas. It means destroying Hamas,” he said.\n“Maybe Hamas will say, ‘Wait — we want to release ten more,’” added Netanyahu. “Fine, bring them. We’ll take them. And then we’ll go in. But there will be no situation where we stop the war.”\n“A temporary ceasefire — fine. But we’re going all the way,” he said.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, right, meets wounded IDF reservists from the ‘Wounded Soldiers for Victory’ forum, at his office in Jerusalem, May 12, 2025.

(Maayan Toaf/GPO)\nNetanyahu also said Israel was gearing up to let Gazans emigrate, in keeping with a plan announced by Trump in February to take over the devastated Strip, oust its residents and rebuild it as a coastal resort.\n“We’ve already set up a governing body that will allow [civilians] to exit, but the main issue is this — we need host countries willing to absorb them,” said Netanyahu. “That’s what we’re working on right now.”\n“If we give them a way out, I’m telling you — more than 50% will leave. In my opinion, many more,” he said, assuring the soldiers that, in any case, “Hamas will not remain.”\nThe premier said the “Wounded Soldiers for Victory” reservists, who oppose a ceasefire in Gaza, are “an inspiration, and with your spirit, we are heading toward a total victory.” The reservists, meanwhile, “expressed support for Netanyahu’s leadership in pursuing victory and achieving all the war’s objectives, and urged him to decisively defeat the terrorist organization Hamas,” the premier’s office said.\nAFP contributed to this report."}

(res.) Ran Cohen Rochverger stated that the enforcement actions outlined by the Attorney General’s Office constituted “the most significant [advance] since the petition was submitted to the High Court of Justice regarding the enlistment of yeshiva students.”\nThe bottom line is that “a significant step up in enforcement is required,” he said, agreeing with what he described as Baharav-Miara’s criticism of the “inadequate manner in which the IDF and other authorities have acted so far against evaders from the yeshiva population.”\nRochverger’s statement comes a week after he alleged in a report written for the Israel Hofsheet organization that from November 2023 until this April, the military had significantly increased penalties for desertion against regular service and reserve troops, without a corresponding change in legal consequences for draft evaders.\nEmanuel Fabian contributed to this report."}

The other presents the head, chest, and upper arms of a man with long hair.

It presents several hundred graves, predominantly Christian but also some pagans from the late Roman period and Muslims from the early Islamic period (7th and 8th centuries CE.)

Briefly abandoned at the beginning of the 3rd century, it was resettled in the late 3rd/early 4th century. According to Michael, during the Byzantine period (324-336 CE), the town had as many as 5,000 residents, making it a significant center in the Negev.\n“However, we do not know much about the town, as it has not been properly excavated yet,” he said.\nThe cemetery is located south of the settlement.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“It was first dug in the 1980s,” Michael said. “So far, archaeologists have excavated some 300 graves.”\nThe ebony figurines were found during the 2017 excavation season.\nWhile the mystery of the woman and child’s identity will likely never be solved, they were probably not the only nonnative people buried in the cemetery.\n“Since Tel Malhata was located on these important trade routes, many people passed through it,” Michael said. “We can see it in the numerous exotic findings we have unearthed, including some rare alabaster jewelry.”"}

Hamad stressed to Bahbah that Hamas was ready to work with the Trump administration to secure a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, with security arrangements to ensure a years-long calm until a final settlement of the conflict is reached, the sources said.\nOn Sunday, Hamad told Bahbah that Hamas was prepared to move ahead with Alexander’s release, saying it had located him after claiming to have lost contact with his captors. Bahbah, in turn, told Hamas to inform Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani of the decision. The Qatari premier then called Witkoff to confirm that Alexander’s release would be moving ahead.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAlexander was released on Monday evening. On Tuesday, Israel dispatched a negotiating team to Doha for another round of hostage talks, at the request of the Trump administration.\nBut the sides face an uphill battle, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still insisting that he will only agree to a temporary ceasefire, whereas Hamas is demanding a permanent end to the war sparked by its attack against Israel on October 7, 2023."}

However, since his rule began, hundreds of Alawites — former Assad loyalists — have been killed, some of them by brutal executions.\nSyria is mostly settled by Sunni Muslims, and Druze make up about three percent of the population. The government is now run by Islamists, some of whom are linked to extremist groups.\nThe latest round of violence against the Druze began in March after a purported recording of a Druze man cursing the Prophet Mohammad circulated on social media.\nSheikh Muafak Tarif, spiritual leader of the Druze community in Israel, speaks at a conference on “The Druze and the security of Israel: The blood alliance in practice” at Western Galilee College in Acre on May 5, 2025.

According to Syrian news sites, hundreds of Druze students have left universities in Damascus, Aleppo and Homs because of a sharp increase in violence.\nA Druze man in Syria whose mustache was shaved by Islamic extremists in an undated photo that has circulated on social media during the sectarian violence in Syria of May 2025.

Most live in Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Israel. Their religion is secret, but they consider the figures of Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Mohammed to be prophets. Druze do not accept converts.\nAtalla was born in Majdal Shams on the Golan Heights in 1966, the year before Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Six Day War. Israel annexed the area in 1981 and today, approximately 29,000 Druze live there, some 20% of whom have Israeli citizenship.\nA member of the Druze security forces stands guard in Jaramana in the suburb of Damascus on April 29, 2025, following overnight sectarian clashes.

This, he said, is also a challenge facing Israel, which is composed of minorities and different religions and ethnic groups.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“We don’t have a civil war, but we have to figure out how to create an Israeli identity” to guarantee Israel’s future, Mansour said.\nIsrael’s former ambassador to Panama, Reda Mansour.

But the truth is that I’m not a guest here. I’m also a landlord.”\nHe said that every day the law isn’t canceled is a “shame” for the state.\nKhateeb echoed Bader’s feelings in a phone conversation with The Times of Israel.\nLorena Kizel Khateeb, a Druze journalist and social activist, speaks at the Knesset about increasing the number of Arabic speakers to ‘defend Israel’ on March 4, 2025.

There are challenges and hardships we face — and there are certainly some — but we manage to thrive, stay true to ourselves, and live with pride.”\nOn the May 9 radio program, Khateeb said she recently received a phone message from a man in Syria who wrote her, “You are lucky to have been born in a country that respects you and who you are, regardless of your identity.”\nThe words moved her, she said, reminding her of “how truly fortunate we are to have been born in the State of Israel.

Majorities also opposed a range of other Trump policies not directly tied to Israel or Jewish issues.\nThe poll also found that 92% of Jewish voters think that someone can be critical of Israeli government policies and still be “pro-Israel.” It found that the share who said they were very or somewhat attached to Israel had declined from 82% before the October 7, 2023, attack to 69% now.\nThe poll found that only 34% of respondents have favorable views of Netanyahu, while 61% have unfavorable views of him. Meanwhile, 62% believe that he resumed the war in Gaza in March for personal political considerations as opposed to Israel’s national security considerations, and 38% believe the opposite.\nThe poll found that 72% of respondents also believe the resumed military action in Gaza makes it more likely for the hostages to be killed, and 28% say it makes them more likely to be released.\n“When Jews are looking at Israel and thinking about Israel, while they’re very attached to it, it’s very striking how negative the attitudes towards Netanyahu are,” said Gerstein."}

The EBU has rejected such calls from a few dozen former participants, a small group of members of the European Parliament, reigning winner Nemo, and the public broadcasters of Eurovision participants Iceland, Spain, Ireland, Belgium and Slovenia.\nAfter months of protests over Israel’s participation, the Irish public broadcaster RTE reported last week that the EBU made a commitment to “have a wider discussion amongst members in due course.” Any such discussion will not affect this year’s contest, which kicks off Tuesday with the first of two semifinals, and is seen as unlikely to lead to Israel being barred.\nWhile the fever pitch of anti-Israel sentiment was higher ahead of the 2024 competition in Malmo, Sweden, large protests are still expected in Basel this week and Israel’s Yuval Raphael is likely to face some booing in the audience when she performs her ballad, “New Day Will Rise,” on Thursday night.\nOne of 37 acts slated to perform, Raphael is widely expected to be among those who advance to the grand final on Saturday, where 26 entrants will vie for the Eurovision crown.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe singers who advance from the semifinals are determined solely by a public vote, online and via phone, while the winner of the grand final is based 50 percent on a public vote and 50% on scores awarded by professional juries from each of the 37 participating countries.\nAs of this writing, the oft-cited and sometimes accurate Eurovision betting odds predict a fourth-place finish for Israel, with bookmakers likely expecting a similar groundswell of support among pro-Israel voters to that seen last year, when Eden Golan came second in the general public vote and fifth overall.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLeading the pack this year is Sweden’s KAJ, a trio of Swedish-speaking Finnish singers set to perform the catchy “Bara bada bastu,” a comedic ditty about sauna culture seen as this year’s favorite.\nOther strong contenders are Austria’s JJ with the operatic entry “Wasted Love” and France’s Louane with the soaring ballad “Maman.”\nEurovision 2025 favorites, KAJ members Kevin Holmstrom (C), Axel Ahman (R) and Jakob Norrgard pose for photos on April 23, 2025, in Stockholm, Sweden. (Jonathan NACKSTRAND / AFP)\nSome analysts have predicted that the professional juries could deliberately downgrade or snub Raphael regardless of what they think of her performance, in order to counteract a landslide in the public vote, or to confirm their countrymen’s ambivalence toward Israel. The EBU is unlikely to want the headache and backlash that would come with an Israel win, which would include awarding Israel hosting rights for next year. (When Ukraine won in 2022, the following year’s competition was hosted by the UK).\nRaphael — a survivor of Hamas’s Octoner 7, 2023, massacre at the Nova music festival — will take the stage with “New Day Will Rise,” a power ballad that suggests “darkness will fade, all the pain will go by.” Many reviewers have praised Raphael’s vocals and the emotion of the song, though some have thought it too similar to last year’s “Hurricane” and criticized the decision to send another ballad.\n“I’m 100 percent focused on the music, I’m 100 percent focused on my song,” Raphael told The Times of Israel in an interview last month. “There are things that I can control and things that I can’t control. Ultimately, there’s no point investing energy in something I can’t control… the most important thing to me is to bring honor to my country and do the best I can.”\nEden Golan of Israel enters the arena during the flag parade before the Grand Final of the Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo, Sweden, May 11, 2024. (AP/Martin Meissner)\nGolan last year was largely shunned by her fellow contestants, who either opposed Israel’s participation in the competition or didn’t want to break ranks and associate with the pariah of the competition. Tensions ran high backstage; some artists accused the Israeli delegation of bullying, while Israeli public broadcaster Kan pointed to several instances of disrespect and hatred from other countries.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn an interview last week with the Walla news site, Golan revealed that the boos while on stage were so loud that she could hear them through her noise-canceling headphones, and while it initially felt like a “slap in the face,” she ultimately let it fuel her performance and her desire to win.\nA strict new code of conduct for participants rolled out ahead of this year’s show demands all contestants refrain “from political promotion or related conduct, including actions, statements, or symbols during — or in relation to — the event,” and must also “avoid linking political views to their ESC participation.”\nThe new handbook – which for the first time has been made mandatory for anyone accredited for the event – promises no tolerance for “any kind of harassment, bullying, hate speech and any form of discrimination.”\nWhile Raphael is unlikely to be embraced by every participant, she will have at least one ally in her corner – Azerbaijan’s Mamagama, which is fronted by Asaf Mishiyev, a proud member of the country’s Mountain Jew community.\nIn an interview with The Times of Israel earlier this year, Mishiyev, as well as his Muslim bandmates, sent “big hugs” to Raphael and criticized the hate leveled against her.\nMamagama band members, from left, Hasan Heydar, Asaf Mishiyev and Arif Imanov (Tato Panahi)\nUnlike in years past, audience members at the Eurovision live shows will be able to display Palestinian flags, after Swiss organizers said that any flags legal in the country will be allowed into the arena, instead of only the flags of countries participating in the competition.\nIt remains to be seen whether the producers will choose to pan to any such flags in the crowd on live TV, in particular during Israel’s performance.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn a preview of the sea of green, white, black and red she may face onstage, Palestinian flags were the most ubiquitous of those being waved along the processional route as Raphael walked the “turquoise carpet” during the opening ceremony in Basel on Sunday, alongside protest banners and some booing.\nA protester holds a Palestinian flag as she takes part in a demonstration against Israel during the Eurovision Song Contest 2025 opening ceremony in Basel, Switzerland, on May 11, 2025. (Stefan Wermuth / AFP)\nBut the flag rules have been tightened when it comes to the contestants themselves, with the performers allowed to only hold their own country’s flag on stage and during any official events. The move doesn’t only ban Palestinian flags, but also LGBTQ flags, transgender flags and non-binary flags, angering some activists.\nLike Golan before her, Raphael will refrain from wearing a hostage pin or expressing any political opinions during official Eurovision events, although in interviews leading up to the competition she has called for all the hostages “to be returned home now.”\nDespite the protests, the biggest threat to Israel’s future participation in Eurovision may be Israel itself.\nIf the government moves ahead with its plan to privatize or shutter Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan would no longer be able to maintain membership in the EBU, bringing the country’s 52-year run in the competition to an end."}

A Houthi missile had recently landed nearby, bringing most air traffic to a standstill.\n“I was looking outside at where it had landed and thinking about the absence of any condemnation for the injured innocent civilians or potential fatalities that could have occurred,” she said. “Every second, every day, I’m reminded of how hypocritical the rest of the world is.”\nOn her third visit to Israel in the past year, Molan was a guest of right-wing organization Nikraim LaDegel (Called to the Flag) at whose “Salute to Israel’s Independence Day” event she spoke on May 5. She also attended the Atlas Awards held by the Ayn Rand Center to receive an award for Moral Courage in recognition of her support for Israel and her commitment to truth in journalism.\nHer schedule was short — just two nights in Tel Aviv — but densely packed with meetings, speeches, and encounters with families whose lives had been upended by war.\nShe recalled meeting a father whose child is still held hostage in Gaza, and a woman whose son was mistakenly shot by an IDF soldier.\n“She held no anger,” Molan said. “That kind of forgiveness, that kind of resilience, stays with you.”\nThe Australian broadcaster, best known until recently for her sharp commentary on sports and politics, has spent the past seven months as one of the world’s most public pro-Israel advocates, highlighting the plight of the hostages and defending Israel’s war in Gaza.\nErin Molan (center) at the Nikraim LaDegel conference in Tel Aviv on May 5, 2025. (Credit: Courtesy)\nMolan has found herself increasingly recognized in Israel, where people on the street often flock to her, eager to thank her for her support.\nShe says that while the trip renewed her sense of purpose, she feels conflicted over the public praise.\n“I just tell the truth, and I feel guilty that people feel the need to thank me. It shouldn’t be courageous to say that murdering civilians is evil,” she told The Times of Israel.\nA lone voice\nEighteen months ago, Molan was a popular and well-known journalist at Sky News Australia, a subscription-based channel known for its influence in conservative political circles.\nMolan joined the network in 2022 as a primetime contributor and host of a weekly current affairs program, “Erin,” which featured interviews, political commentary, and Molan’s perspectives on domestic and international issues.\nMolan, who is Catholic and had never been to Israel, found her life and career turned upside down following Hamas’s October 7, 2023, massacre, in which terrorists killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in Israel and kidnapped 251 into Gaza.\nStunned by the invasion, she immediately began expressing solidarity, initially on social media and then in broadcast segments.\n“It was never complex to me or grey or fuzzy. It was black and white as to who evil was in this scenario,” she said.\nBut for Molan, it was the responses to the attack that shocked and activated her more than the attack itself.\n“October 7 wasn’t the most horrifying part — it was the world’s reaction to it,” she said.\nHundreds of pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel protesters gather at the Sydney Opera House, which was planned to be illuminated in the colors of the Israeli flag following the October 7 Hamas atrocities in Israel, while police advised the Jewish community to stay away, in Sydney, New South Wales, on October 9, 2023. (AP/Rick Rycroft)\nA few days after the massacre, before Israel had even mounted a response, Molan watched as crowds gathered in Sydney in celebration of the attack. One rally lit up the Sydney Opera House in which attendees were screaming, among other things, “Gas the Jews.”\n“That was probably the first time I felt genuine shame for my country,” she said. “It was horrific, sickening, gut-wrenching.”\nMolan says that she was “completely naive” about the antisemitism that existed in the West, especially in her native Australia, where some 2,062 antisemitic incidents were recorded between October 2023 and September 2024, compared to 495 incidents a year earlier, according to data from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ).\n“I had absolutely no idea what lay just under the surface.”\nAustralian TV host Erin Molan speaks on Sky News, in a September 2024 monologue about the Israel-Hamas war. (Screen capture via YouTube, used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)\nIn a monologue broadcast on Sky News, Molan said, “This is a war not just against Jews but against the West,” she told viewers. “This is a moment where we choose what side we’re on, and if we get it wrong, the consequences will be catastrophic.”\nIn Israel, Molan became something of a sensation — hailed as a rare voice of clarity and compassion in a global media landscape many Israelis saw as indifferent, if not outright hostile.\nBack home in Australia, however, the fallout was swift and more intense than Molan expected.\n“When after a terrorist attack I came out very strongly in support of the victims and staunchly opposed to the terrorists who committed those atrocities, never did I think for a second that I would be considered controversial or in the minority,” she says.\nAs a public figure — one of the first women to anchor a major sports show in Australia — Molan had weathered criticism before, but says this was of a different order.\n“I was the first woman in Australia to host one of the most popular sporting shows, so the abuse and horrific things that were written about me basically because I’m a woman were pretty intense,” she said.\n“Any time a woman is uncompromising in her beliefs or takes a stance that is considered bold, a lot of the world’s reaction is to be uncomfortable with that.”\nAs Molan’s star rose and she became known to audiences the world over for her commentary on Israel, the criticism intensified. She received a torrent of death threats, including some targeted against her 6-year-old daughter.\nErin Molan accepting the Moral Courage Award at the Atlas Awards in Tel Aviv, May 6, 2025. (Courtesy)\nThen, quietly and without much explanation, her role at Sky News Australia was cut. In December, she confirmed she was no longer with the broadcaster. Though no explicit reason was given, many are convinced her pro-Israel stance was the deciding factor.\nMolan says that she cares as much about “children suffering in Gaza as children in Israel. I just understand who their real enemy is, which is Hamas.”\n“Peace is the ultimate goal for Israel and for all of us who believe in freedom and democracy, but there is no peace for anyone in this region — including the people of Gaza– whilst Hamas exists.”\nA deal with the devil?\nWhile some may have expected her to retreat into obscurity or moderate her tone to appeal to a broader audience, Molan has only become more vocal in her support for Israel.\nShe also found a new platform in the digital space, one less encumbered by editorial constraints. In February 2025, Molan launched a new weekly news program called “69 X Minutes” on Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter), drawing 10 million views on its premiere night.\nShe describes it as “unfiltered, unbiased and raw” — a vehicle for the kind of truth-telling Molan felt mainstream media could no longer accommodate.\nAustralian TV host Erin Molan speaks on her show 69X Minutes in April. (Screen capture via YouTube, used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)\nYet her presence on X places her in a complex — and, to some, contradictory — position. Under Musk’s ownership, the platform has amplified extremist voices, reinstated previously banned antisemitic content and allowed white supremacists to flourish. Musk himself has echoed antisemitic conspiracy theories and engaged with known hate accounts.\nFor Molan, a high-profile ally of Israel and outspoken opponent of antisemitism, this alignment raises an obvious paradox: claiming to fight antisemitism on a platform that has done more than almost any other to spread it.\nMolan doesn’t see it that way. She insists that fighting hatred requires going directly to the spaces where it thrives.\n“Existing in an echo chamber is a waste of time,” she says. “You need to be where those antisemitic voices are to fight back.”\nShe argues that platforms like X offer unparalleled reach, and that she’s committed to using the largest megaphone available to “drown those voices out.”\nCertainly, her presence on X has extended her influence far beyond what legacy media once afforded her. Beyond her news channel, Molan has become a highly sought-after speaker in Israel, the United States, and elsewhere, invited to address issues ranging from security to free speech.\nHer interest in national security and public service, she says, stems from her late father, Jim Molan, a highly respected Australian Army major general and senator who led the country’s forces in Iraq during the war.\nThere have even been quiet efforts to encourage her to run for office in Australia — something she has ruled out for now, citing her focus on caring for her daughter.\nWhatever she does next, and despite the death threats, professional setbacks, and having no obvious skin in the game, Molan is adamant that her advocacy for Israel will remain a part of her life.\n“It isn’t just Israel that is under attack — it’s every single thing that I hold dear; it’s my daughter’s future,” she says.\n“I don’t have one iota of doubt that I’m standing on the right side of history.”"}

(Clockwise from the top: Michael Cordonsky/Archaeological Institute, Tel Aviv University; Michael Cordonsky/Archaeological Institute, Tel Aviv University; Harvard’s expedition to Samaria/Semitic Museum, Harvard University)\n“Most names come from seal impressions,” Sober told The Times of Israel, referring to the small circles of clay stamped on strings tying important documents in ancient times. “This means that they did not belong to common villagers but to the higher echelons of society.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nFor this reason, the vast majority of the names found belonged to men and not to women.\nOther names were found of pottery sherds, or bullae (seals).\nAriel Vishne from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. (Oron Kaplan)\nThe researchers counted names that repeated themselves only once, including names that presented the same core root with different suffixes of addition, such as Nathan, Elnathan, or Nethanel — all of which suggest the idea of a child given by God (El in Hebrew).\nOther names recorded in the database include Aminadav, Zvi, Menachem, Gad and Karmi.\nUsing statistical methodologies employed in the field of ecology, the researchers were able to factor out the limitations of their sample. They also applied their technique to modern naming datasets from several countries, including Israel, France, the UK, and the US, to check the reliability of their results.\n”Our findings suggest that societies with higher name diversity tend to be more cosmopolitan and open to external influences,” Piasetzky said in a statement. “Conversely, lower name diversity often corresponds to more traditional societies with stronger cultural conformity.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nLife on a trade route\nThe kingdom of Israel’s territory covered the northern part of the land, including the Galilee and Samaria (today’s northern West Bank), in what Finkelstein described as “a strategic location along trade routes fostering cultural influences.” The kingdom ceased to exist in the 8th century BCE after the Assyrian Empire conquered it in 722 BCE and deported its inhabitants. These events are narrated in both the Bible and in Assyrian records.\nJudah, on the other hand, survived another 150 years, until the Babylonians managed to conquer Jerusalem.\n“For several reasons, including how literacy became more widespread towards the end of the First Temple period, we have many more findings from the Kingdom of Judah compared to the Kingdom of Israel,” Sober said. “Yet it was interesting to see how, while more names from Judah survived, Israel presented a higher diversity.”\nAccording to Sober, the result was statistically significant.\n“We ran some statistical tests to ensure this was not coincidental,” he said. “This suggests that Israel’s society was more open, possibly because it had more frequent interactions with its neighbors, for example, the Phoenicians.”\nDr. Barak Sober from Hebrew University of Jerusalem. (Courtesy)\n“Historians who study both kingdoms usually talk about Israel as a more cosmopolitan kingdom because it was mentioned in other people’s records, which rarely happened with Judah,” he added. “Our findings fit nicely with the historical understanding of that period.”\nThe Judean bubble?\nAnother phenomenon that the researchers observed was that name diversity in Judah progressively shrank between the end of the 8th and the 6th centuries BCE.\n“Other archaeological findings and historical records suggest that in the second phase of the First Temple Period, Judah witnessed a progressive standardization of cult and became a more consolidated polity,” said Sober. “This could explain why the variety of names narrowed.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to Sober, another possible interpretation of the finding lies in the influx of Israelite refugees who settled in Judah after the Assyrian conquest.\n“Archaeological evidence shows that after the Assyrian military campaign, people migrated from north to south, and Judah witnessed a settlement boom,” he said. “It could be that at first, this migration wave increased the diversity of names, and as the new immigrants assimilated into Judean society, this diversity decreased.”\nThe researchers also analyzed name distribution within the two kingdoms.\n“What we found is that while in Judah, its capital Jerusalem presented more diversity than the rest of the kingdom, in Israel the opposite was true, and the capital Samaria showed less diversity than the peripheral areas,” Sober said.\nIsrael Antiquities Authority’ Dr. Joel Uziel holds a collection of First Temple period bullae (sealings) at Jerusalem’s City of David, August 2017. (Eliyahu Yanai, City of David)\nThe expert said it is difficult to find an explanation for this phenomenon.\n“It’s fascinating that these neighboring sibling kingdoms, which we would expect to share similar cultures, display such distinct social phenomena and structures,” he said.\nAsked whether future excavations and discoveries could change the results of their research, Sober said that it is possible but not likely unless a significant number of new inscriptions are uncovered.\n“A sample of 1,000 names is not so small,” he said. “Unless a new body of inscriptions emerges skewing our results, I believe it won’t happen.”"}

Close to 70 percent said the words “fascist” and “racist” describe him very or somewhat well.\nPrevious surveys have consistently reported low approval ratings for Trump from Jewish voters, who have leaned heavily Democratic for decades. The poll found that a large majority of respondents plan to support Democrats in next year’s midterm elections.\nBut the “antisemitic” description is notable because Trump campaigned on fighting antisemitism. Since he returned to office, his administration has taken a number of high-profile actions with the stated goal of fighting antisemitism, including pulling billions of dollars in funding from universities and seeking to deport foreign student activists.\nThe poll found that only a fraction of respondents thought those actions reduce antisemitism, while a much larger share say the actions increase antisemitism:\n49 percent of respondents said the funding cuts to universities increased antisemitism, while 25 percent said the cuts reduce antisemitism and 26 percent said they have no impact.\n61 percent of respondents believed that the Trump administration arresting and deporting pro-Palestinian protesters increased antisemitism, while 20 percent said it reduces antisemitism and another 20 percent said it has no impact.\nOverall, 77 percent of Jewish voters are concerned about antisemitism on college campuses, while even more are concerned about antisemitism in the United States more broadly.\nBut 64 percent disapprove of the job Trump is doing to combat antisemitism, while 36 percent approve.\n“Part of what’s going on is that Jewish voters believe that the actions that the Trump administration is taking, statements that the president is making, statements and actions of others in his administration — that these things actually increase antisemitism,” Jim Gerstein, a founding partner of GBAO Strategies, said in a briefing about the survey.\nHe said, “It is very striking that a lot of things that are being done in the name of combating antisemitism, Jews in America actually believe that these things increase antisemitism, instead of reduce antisemitism.”\nThe poll was conducted for a new nonpartisan group called the Jewish Voters Resource Center, which aims to collect and disseminate data on Jewish voters and issues. GBAO, which has done polls for liberal Jewish groups in the past, conducted the survey of 800 Jewish voters from 22 April to 1 May. It has a margin of error of 3.5 percent.\nThe new data is being published two weeks after the conclusion of Trump’s first 100 days in office. It follows on the heels of a poll taken in late April by the Mellman Group that found 72 percent of American Jews disapproved of Trump’s job performance.\nWednesday’s poll also found that 74 percent of Jewish voters disapprove of the job Donald Trump is doing on foreign policy, while 26 percent approve. The poll found the same split when it comes to Trump’s proposal to transfer Palestinians in Gaza to Arab countries and have the United States take control of Gaza. Majorities also opposed a range of other Trump policies not directly tied to Israel or Jewish issues.\nThe poll also found that 92 percent of Jewish voters think that someone can be critical of Israeli government policies and still be “pro-Israel.” It found that the share who said they were very or somewhat attached to Israel had declined from 82% before Hamas’ 7 October 2023, attack to 69 percent now.\nThe poll found that only 34 percent of respondents have favourable views of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while 61 percent have unfavourable views of him. Meanwhile, 62 percent believe that he resumed the war in Gaza in March for personal political considerations as opposed to Israel’s national security considerations, and 38 percent believe the opposite.\nThe poll found that 72 percent of respondents also believe the resumed military action in Gaza makes it more likely for the hostages to be killed, and 28 percent say it makes them more likely to be released.\n“When Jews are looking at Israel and thinking about Israel, while they’re very attached to it, it’s very striking how negative the attitudes towards Netanyahu are,” said Gerstein.\nSupport your Jewish community.

Al- Yamani was a PFLP “founder,” a “member of the Central Committee and one of its most prominent military commanders,” and “coordinated special operations…in particular the operation against an aircraft of the Israeli company El Al in July 1968 in Greece.”\nJabarin has also been barred from entering Jordan on security grounds.\nBurgon’s decision to speak at Tuesday night’s event will once again spark calls for Labour to sanction him.  Keir Starmer sacked him from the shadow cabinet on becoming leader of the party.\nIn 2019 he was forced to apologise after footage emerged of him saying Zionism is the “enemy of peace”.\nLast year Burgon was one of four Labour MPs who lost the whip for voting against the government on the two-child benefit cap. His suspension was lifted in February this year.\nOne Labour source this week labelled him a “bad faith actor” in regards to his conduct over the Israel-Palestine issue.\nJabarin became Al-Haq’s director in 2006, and is respected as a human-rights activist by Human Rights Watch (HRW), Amnesty International, and various Palestinian human-rights groups.\nThey have supported his claims that he is the victim of a “smear” campaign in relation to PFLP links.\nUnder his leadership of Al Haq, according to one source, “Al Haq’s staff of Palestinian and foreign researchers have shifted their search for legal redress from Israel’s military and civilian courts to foreign venues.\nThe group is currently bringing a legal case against the UK government over the continued export of F-35 fighter jet components to Israel.

The commitment now takes centre stage in their new podcast, The Rabbi, The Imam and The Power of Dialogue, launched last week to model how people of faith can have difficult conversations without falling apart.\nImam Kurdy says the podcast was born of something deeper than interfaith theory – it was forged in personal trust. “I think our ability to dig deep, to trust the other person that if you dig, they will dig with you… We started to see into each other, that honesty, that person. And it was not something that was threatening or uncomfortable. We’ve reached that stage where we were so honest with each other.”\nThe pair first met over a decade ago at a community dialogue group in South Manchester. Their friendship deepened after Kurdy, a surgeon and Iay Imam originally from Jordan, survived a stabbing outside his mosque in 2017. Rabbi Lewis, leader of South Manchester’s Jewish community, was one of the first to reach out.\nGet The Jewish News Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories\nFREE SIGN UP\n“We said, ‘How can we work together?’” recalls Lewis. “We did. When we did the shul and the mosque, we worked on a number of different events – cooking food for the local homeless shelter, lift-up projects.\nBut the most important aspect of our project is that you can’t make friends during a crisis. You have to develop those friendships beforehand, in advance, under easier times of peace.\nThat long-standing trust proved vital after the Hamas attacks and the war in Gaza, which Kurdy says “hit all of us” and forced both communities to “dig deep”. The pair say it was their friendship – already forged years earlier through shared projects and their support for one another after Kurdy was stabbed in 2017 – that made honest conversation possible. “He wasn’t just a local Imam that was stabbed,” says Lewis. “He was a friend.”\nTheir podcast, co-produced by Mark Schweiger and Philip Berman of Larchmont Productions grew from an earlier initiative – a series of joint school visits across Greater Manchester. “One of the things I sat with was, how can we get to the student, from a grassroots level, and show them that a Jew and a Muslim can stand side by side and coexist?” Schweiger said. “Today, we’ve probably been in front of 9,000 students.”\nThe school sessions – including stops at academies run by Manchester United, Manchester City, Everton and Liverpool – focus on modelling respectful disagreement. Lewis and Kurdy don’t aim to agree – they aim to understand. “It’s not about getting them to agree,” says Lewis. “It’s about: Okay, we understand each other. We know the other person’s pain. And we will do it in a way that doesn’t feel like treason to our own.”\nRabbi Dovid Lewis and Imam Nasser Kurdy lead a school session on dialogue and empathy. Photo Credit: Manchester Grammar School\nThey stress the principle of “face-to-face” dialogue, not side-by-side performative tolerance. “We’re not just giving you a faith view. We’re giving you a conversation,” Lewis says. “Two people who, on paper, should not get on – but who challenge each other as equals.”\nThis has made a real impression on students. One moment stands out: a young Syrian refugee rose in tears to ask a question. “I looked at his face and the pain,” said Lewis. “He doesn’t want my answer. All he wants is empathy. I just said, ‘I’m sorry. I feel for you. Let’s speak about that.’”\nImam Kurdy shares a similar philosophy. “We actually stress the basis on which we are standing. Equality in humanity. Equality in empathy. Equality in respect.\nWe don’t take a point and argue it – we give the background to how a position can be reached when you don’t agree.\nThe podcast builds on that approach. Future episodes will explore faith, disagreement, youth leadership and online conflict. “If one teenager doesn’t react to that nasty post on Instagram or X, if they change their mindset… then the algorithm of the heart changes,” says Lewis. “That’s our real mission.”\nWhile the podcast and school visits have been warmly received, the team acknowledge that a few individuals in both communities have sometimes questioned whether interfaith efforts are worth the effort. “It’s not criticism,” says Kurdy. “But you do occasionally hear it.” Lewis agrees: “Some people just say, ‘Why bother?’ There’s a sense of despair. But we’re doing this precisely because it’s hard — and because it matters.”\nOne school, Lewis adds, even cancelled its Holocaust memorial plans, citing “political sensitivities” – but told the parents not to worry because “the rabbi and the Imam are coming next month.” He shook his head at the logic: “Those two days are interrelated. But this shows the podcast is seen as a resource.”\nA vigil to show Muslim support for the Jewish community in the wake of 7/10\nFor Kurdy, the goal is simple: “Relationships need to be rekindled. Wonderful Jewish-Muslim relationships have just withered away. We want to bring them back together.”\nOr as Rabbi Lewis puts it: “We’re here. We’re here to stay. And we need to speak. Not agree – speak.”\nListen to episode one of The Rabbi, The Imam and The Power of Dialogue here.\nSupport your Jewish community.

Prior to that, I worked at the Board of the Deputies for more than half a decade and at the Jewish Chronicle for three and a half years before that.\nThe reason I am telling you this is not to regurgitate my LinkedIn profile. It’s to provide some background when I tell you that over the years I have received many hundreds, if not thousands, of online comments in response to articles I have written or statements I have made regarding antisemitism. Some of the comments have been positive and supportive. An overwhelming majority have not.\nBut I want to tell you about a shift in the type of negative response I have seen in the past 19 months – and why I think that it’s significant and deeply worrying.\nGet The Jewish News Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories\nFREE SIGN UP\nFor many years, a significant proportion of responses I have received – as have many other Jewish people – when calling out antisemitism have been in the form of what the academic David Hirsh first described as the “Livingstone formulation”. Named after the former mayor of London – who would later become famous for repeatedly appearing on TV to claim that Hitler had supported Zionism “before he went mad”, the formulation’s basic form is as follows:\nAn individual makes a comment which is considered by a Jewish person to be antisemitic and is called out as such. The person who made the original comment attacks the Jewish person for calling this out, accusing them of falsely labelling the comment as antisemitic as part of a concentrated effort to stifle any criticism of Israel.\nKen Livingstone at Church House, Westminster, London, for his disciplinary hearing where he faced a charge of engaging in conduct that was grossly detrimental to the party following his controversial comments about Adolf Hitler.\nUp to 7 October 2023, this formulation was the standard response Jewish people received when they called out anti-Jewish hate, no matter how egregious and obvious it was. A picture of a bug emblazoned with a star of David, wrapped around the face of the Statue of Liberty? The use of the epithets “Zio” or “ZOG” (Zionist Occupied Government), both of which originated from White Supremacists? Rants about supposed Jewish control over world finance or global media? Call any of these out, and as night follows day you would receive frothing responses about how you were attempting to stifle criticism of Israel or its government.\nBut things have changed since Hamas launched their mass-terror attack 19 months ago, in which more than 1,200 people were murdered and hundreds taken captive. Israel responded forcefully – as any country would initially have done after suffering such an attack – and has continued to do so over the last nineteen months, apart from a few weeks of agreed ceasefires. Even considering the 20,000 Hamas combatants which the IDF says it has eliminated, there have been many thousands of others – men, woman and children, who have been killed. You do not have to accept the exact figure provided by the Hamas-controlled Gazan Ministry of Health to know that this is true.\nThe loss of any innocent life is a tragedy; again, this should not be a remotely controversial statement.\nThe war between Israel and Hamas has had a variety of social and geopolitical international consequences. It has also seen a shift in the broad pattern of responses when Jews call out antisemitic comments, actions or incidents.\nNowadays, rather than the Livingstone formulation, the response is far more likely to be along the following lines: ‘how can you be concerned about a simple image or comments when people are literally dying in Gaza.’ This sentiment is not limited to the far-right or the far-left, but has been increasingly expressed even by people towards what might be described as the political centre.\nPeople are attending a pro-Palestinian rally in Rome, Italy, July 06, 2024. (Photo: Andrea Ronchini/NurPhoto)\nThe immediate answer to this is obvious – to take the American expression, ‘you can walk and chew gum at the same time’. It should be perfectly possible to deplore the terrible situation in Gaza while recognising that there are those who are seeking to capitalise on this tragedy to pump antisemitism into the mainstream body politic.\nA whole host of far-right antisemitic social media personalities, for example, have successfully seized on the terrible situation in Gaza to significantly grow their reach.\nPeople will watch and share videos deploring Israeli actions, then be introduced to further content which attempts to dissect Zionism and describe it as being similar to Nazism, and from there, for those who don’t know any better, it’s a simple sidestep into being introduced to the sentiments expressed in the notorious antisemitic forgery, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Most Jewish people might be able to think of examples of people – whether former friends, random acquaintances or celebrities – who appear to be moving through such a radicalisation pipeline.\nBut take a step back and consider the change in approach that new response heralds – the response of ‘how can you complain about a social media post/ graffiti on a synagogue/ a march where people will inevitably chant deeply problematic slogans, when there are people dying in Gaza?’ Because that response is acknowledging that such examples may indeed be antisemitic but is simultaneously dismissing that as irrelevant due to a wider global context. In its most basic form, the stock response has gone from ‘you are lying, Jew’, to ‘so what, Jew? The actions of your co-religionists mean you deserve it – and indeed it’s insulting that you would even dare to complain.’\nFor years it has been an article of faith in progressive circles, popularised on ten thousand university campuses, that ‘words can be a form of violence’. Within the last year and a half, that maxim has quite simply been rewritten to exclude antisemitism – and has excited little more than a few shrugs. Indeed, there is a relatively small but highly vocal group of far-left Jewish activists who have vehemently supported this change.\nIt is unclear what will happen next geopolitically; for my part, I hope that a deal will emerge which will see the remaining hostages still in Hamas’s clutches released, the terrorist group made to leave Gaza, and reconstruction efforts which will allow innocent Palestinians and Israelis whose lives have been shattered and loved ones slain to rebuild as best they can. When the current ramshackle governing coalition in Jerusalem – held together by the right embracing the far-right – collapses, I will not mourn, and neither, I suspect, will a great many Israelis.\nI am regretfully certain, however, that attitudes on antisemitism will not return to the way they were. The stock response from so-called ‘anti-Zionists’ when Jews call out Jew-hatred will no longer inherently acknowledge through their denials that antisemitism is bad, but will rather imply that antisemitism is justified.\nThis should worry us all – whether in Britain or elsewhere in the Diaspora.\nSupport your Jewish community.

By their own admission, they were inspired by SS tactics and supremacist ideology.\n“Had Christopher Ringrose managed to completely finish building the 3D-printed semi-automatic firearm that he had started to, it could have been used leading to devastating consequences.”\nA video that Stewart posted of himself wearing a German army helmet, a Nazi armband and a skull face covering was shown to the jury.\nAt the time of his arrest Ringrose had 3D-printed the components of a semi-automatic firearm and was trying to get the remaining parts.\nIt also emerged that an undercover officer called Blackheart had asked him about the group’s ideology.\nStewart replied: “Personally, I’ve taken inspiration from the SS”, and added: “I also hope that we can extort political rivals and potentially plan operations to meet migrants landing on our beaches and deal with them.\n“As the race war comes to unfold I’d expect members to stand by, wait for orders and deploy to combat our…”\nStewart had sent the officer a list of “standard uniform” for Einsatz 14 which included a Black SS helmet, “mask, balaclava, skull face mask or anything to hide identity” as well as a Swastika armband, although the defendant said this was “Not a given. It must be earned”.\nMeanwhile the court heard how potential recruits were sent a vetting form with questions such as: “What is your opinion on the historic paramilitary force, the SS?” and “Out of so many different options, who would you say you hold most of your hatred for – kikes, n******, shitskins, fags etc and why”.\nDiscussing potential targets at the end of January 2024, the group named a mosque in Leeds.\nOn Wednesday a jury rejected claims the defendants were fantasists with no intention of carrying out their threats.\nRingrose, of Cannock, Staffordshire, Pitzettu, of Mickleover, Derbyshire and Stewart, of Tingley, Wakefield, West Yorkshire, were found guilty of a charge of preparing acts of terrorism and charges of collecting information likely to be useful to a person preparing or committing an act of terrorism.\nRingrose was also convicted of manufacturing a prohibited weapon.

Treat him like one", "media_type": "article", "date": "May 14, 2025, 9:42 am", "content": "I start with an admission. I used to quite like Kanye West. His music provided part of the soundtrack to my teenage years. I even went to see him perform live once. A lot of his tracks are really quite good – some of them still feature on my running playlist, spurring me on to yet another disapprovingly average 5K time.\nA shame, then, that West’s musical talents have now been overshadowed by his vile antisemitism. A series of comments spread over several years should leave us in no doubt: this rapper is one of the world’s most high-profile Jew haters. Just in case there was any lingering doubt, West himself confirmed it earlier this year, writing: “I am a Nazi” and “I love Hitler”.\nSadly, a rump of Jew haters, cranks and conspiracy theorists like West will always exist. What is more concerning in his case is how his antisemitism, his Nazi-supporting tirades have been given so much attention by an all too willing media, both old and new.\nGet The Jewish News Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories\nFREE SIGN UP\nLet’s start with social media, where most of these venomous, vitriolic outbursts have been posted. The companies that continue to allow this self-declared Nazi a platform to disseminate his poison need to be brought to heel – by law, if they continue to refuse to get their houses in order. Freedom of expression is one thing, allowing somebody to promote Nazi ideology to tens of millions of followers is quite another.\nBen Kentish\nAfter his initial anti-Jewish rant in 2022, West was banned from Twitter and Instagram. The suspension lasted a matter of weeks.\nHe was then banned a second time by Twitter (now X) after sharing swastika images. Again, he was soon reinstated. In Silicon Valley, it seems, spreading Nazi propaganda is deemed worthy of little more than a slap on the wrist.\nAs a result, West still has an enormous platform from which to spread his antisemitic poison whenever he sees fit. Across X and Instagram he has over 50 million followers – more than three times the number of Jews in the world. Even he appears somewhat surprised that he can still get away with it, recently making a point of thanking X owner Elon Musk for ”allowing me to vent”, which he said had been “very cathartic”. When self-declared Nazis are expressing their gratitude for allowing them the space to spew Nazi slurs, it is probably well past time to update your editorial policy.\nBut if social media has given West a platform for his antisemitic outbursts, traditional media has amplified them, acting as a megaphone for his Jew-baiting. Rather than dismissing his rants as the hate-filled ramblings of someone who is racist, mad, desperate for attention or quite possibly all of the above, the press dutifully reports whatever outrageous slurs he has come out with most recently. Is it in the public interest for us to hear in minute detail just how much this particular rapper hates Jews? Is he relevant enough, important enough, for his racist attacks on Jews to be repeated as often as they are? I’m not so sure.\nWhen self-declared Nazis are expressing their gratitude for allowing them the space to spew Nazi slurs, it is probably well past time to update your editorial policy\nSome go even further, actively providing West with another major platform on which to promote his beliefs. Back in 2022, for example, Piers Morgan – perhaps the most famous British journalist alive today – invited West on to his popular YouTube show to explain why he had vowed to “go death con 3 on Jewish people” and why he believed Jews had undue influence over the media and the music industry. West defended his posts, repeating the points he was making. The interview has currently been watched 10 million times.\nAfter West’s most recent declaration of “love” for Hitler and his self-identification as a Nazi, Morgan’s team tried it again. This time, the rapper walked out after 19 minutes, triggering a flood of headlines for Morgan and his show.\nYes, interviewing a self-declared Hitler enthusiast might bring you attention. It might get you YouTube views that many other media outlets could only dream of. But antisemitism should not be exploited for the sake of publicity. Jew hatred is not a PR tool.\nRacist rapper Kayne West. Probably.\nMorgan and others who allow West to air his views in ever greater detail would no doubt say that these interviews provide a platform to challenge him and confront him. But this fuels the idea that Nazism is somehow a legitimate view, worthy of being engaged with, discussed and debated. Having a lengthy debate about whether Jews really do brutally exploit people in the media for their own financial gain normalises antisemitism.  Yes, free speech is important. Controversial views should not silenced. But we have to draw the line somewhere – there has to be a collective agreement that some views are so abhorrent that those who spout them will not be actively engaged with and even encouraged to continue to do so. “I’m a Nazi” and “I love Hitler” surely meets the bar.\nAntisemitism should not be exploited for the sake of publicity. Jew hatred is not a PR tool\nWhat’s more, West is, in many ways, irrelevant – or at least he should be. He does not hold elected office. He has no actual power. His musical career peaked years ago. Since then, he has done little of any note apart from post offensive things. He is influential, yes, but only because of the platform he is constantly given. In short, West is not someone whose views we need to be endlessly heard, or scrutinised or debated. He is a no more than a washed up rapper who has a hatred of Jews and a penchant for the Nazis that should see him banished from public life for good. We would do well to treat him as we would any racist conspiracy theorist we might encounter online or in real life: ignore him, deny him the attention he craves and leave him to shout into the wind for as long as he likes.\nThat this hasn’t happened is perhaps partly a result of the wider way in which West’s obvious Jew hatred has been dismissed. There have been endless attempts to explain or even excuse his bile. “He’s obviously just mentally unwell”, many people say, or “Oh he’s just going through some sort of breakdown.” This is apologism, pure and simple. If someone states that they are a Nazi then we should treat them as a Nazi, rather than watch millions of people trying to find a way to let them off the hook. Plenty of us have struggled with our mental health without finding ourselves expressing our adoration for Hitler.\nThe vast majority of people suffering mental breakdowns do not proudly themselves to be Nazis. No mental health conditions I am aware of list antisemitism as a symptom. It is dangerous to try to dismiss West’s obvious Jew-hatred as simply a medical condition for which he should not be held responsible, rather than a deeply-held opinion that he very clearly holds.\nThe treatment of West is a case study in how Jew hatred can be normalised. Social media companies must stop giving him the platform to promote Nazism and more traditional media outlets must treat him with the contempt he deserves.\nAntisemitism is not an illness or an affliction. It is an ideology. Those who promote it do need not to be listened to and engaged with, but scorned and shut down, denied the attention they demand.\nThat is true regardless of someone’s musical abilities or how many social media followers they have.

Infantile. Nappy-brained logic. It’s geopolitical conflict as football: pick a scarf, chant the songs, hate the other side\nLet me state some uncomfortable truths, which shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. First: Hamas is a psychopathic death cult. Not some misunderstood resistance movement. It is a misogynistic, homophobic, Jew-hating Islamist murder machine that dragged babies out of their homes and burned them alive and would joyfully slaughter my wife and children given half a chance. It shoots its own people on sight for speaking out of turn or retrieving aid stockpiled for its own use or black-market profit. If your response to that is “but” then mazeltov – you’ve lost your mind.\nSecond: the Israeli government, led by teflon Benjamin Netanyahu, doesn’t seem remotely interested in the best interests of its own people – let alone the 58 precious hostages, most now presumed dead, still languishing in terror tunnels.\nWe don’t need another Saturday afternoon hate march, courtesy of Jeremy Corbyn and the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. We need a march with banners that declare, “No to Hamas, Yes to peace\nBy now Netanyahu’s primary goal should be blindingly obvious to anyone breathing. Clinging to power. If that means surrounding himself with militant thugs like his security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir and finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, so be it. He is a man who knows that dragging this war out may be the only thing keeping him out of a prison cell.\nAnd yet, these two truths – that Hamas is monstrous and Netanyahu a millstone – cannot co-exist in the brains of most people. If you say the first, you’re accused of being a genocidal Zionist. Say the second and you’re dismissed as a terrorist sympathiser. It’s puerile. Infantile. Nappy-brained logic. It’s geopolitical conflict as football: pick a scarf, chant the songs, hate the other side.\nYou’re either mindlessly parroting “Free Palestine” while ignoring the fact that Hamas would kill or oppress 90 percent of the people standing next to you for prizing free speech or being female, or pretending that every Israeli missile only kills the bad guys.\nA frothing hate carnival for people who think Hamas is the Che Guevara of Gaza\nWhere have all the grow ups gone? Where are the people who can say, calmly and maturely, that Palestinians deserve a future free from Islamist tyranny and the IDF, and that Israelis – the vast majority of whom oppose Netanyahu (76% did not vote for his party in the 2022 election) and have only ever wanted peace – deserve to live without fearing the next 7 October? How did we end up in a place where saying, “I support the Palestinians and the eradication of Hamas” gets you branded a traitor by both sides?\nWhere are all the people who, to quote the philosopher Alan Partridge, are “hopping mad and want something in the middle”?\nWe don’t need another Saturday afternoon hate march, courtesy of Jeremy Corbyn and the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. We need a march with banners that declare, “No to Hamas, Yes to peace.” One where Jews, Muslims, Christians, atheists – everyone – can stand together and say: we are done with this wretched cycle of one-eyed righteousness.\nLet’s have that march.

Trump had confirmed in a social media post writing that Alexander, 21, “is coming home to his family”.is coming home to his family”.\n“This was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators — Qatar and Egypt — to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones,” the US president added.\nHamas confirmed the hostage release just one day before Trump begins a tour of the Middle East.\nReports in Israel on Sunday suggested US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff  had recently told families of hostages held in Gaza that he disagrees with Israel’s approach to the war in the Strip, and believes reaching a new ceasefire and hostage release deal is the correct next step to take.\nAccording to Channel 12, Witkoff told the families that the US “wants to return the hostages, but Israel is not ready to end the war.”\n“Israel is prolonging the war, even though we do not see where further progress can be made,” Witkoff said, according to the report, which cited sources who attended the meeting.\nWitkoff was reportedly involved in talks with Hamas, Qatar, Egypt and Israel on a hostage deal and longer-term calm.\nTrump is also embarking on a Middle East tour on Tuesday  — which includes Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates  but not Israel, but  American officials insist it is shaped by a focus on economic ties, not a slight against the Jewish state.\n“His first trip is about economic opportunity. That’s where his focus is,” US ambassador to Israel Mick Huckabee said last week.\n““What he’s doing is not because he’s snubbing Israel… he’s spent more time with the prime minister of Israel than he has with any other world leader. I think that says a lot.”\nHuckabee sought to reassure Israelis that Trump remains a strong supporter of the country. “I would just say to people, ‘relax, calm down, Donald Trump loves you… he’s got your back.’”\nIsrael responded to the release of Gaza hostage Alexander saying The office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu responded  to the release of Gaza hostage Alexander in a statement saying : “The US has informed Israel of Hamas’s intention to release soldier Edan Alexander as a gesture to the Americans, without conditions or anything in exchange.\n“The US has conveyed to Israel that this is expected to lead to negotiations for the release of hostages according to the original Witkoff framework, which Israel has already accepted. Israel is preparing for the possibility that this effort will be implemented.”\nIn a later statement, his office added: “Israel has not committed to a ceasefire of any kind or the release of terrorists but only to a safe corridor that will allow for the release of Edan.”\nAlexander was taken captive from his tank during the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, during which terrorists killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages back to the Strip, sparking the ongoing war. He has been held in Gaza for over 580 days.\nHe is one of 59 total captives still held by Palestinian terror groups.\nTrump was also facing criticism over claims he is ready to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet as a gift from the ruling family of Qatar during his trip to the Middle East this coming week.\nAmerican officials say it could be converted into a potential presidential aircraft.\nThe Qatari government said a final decision had not been made, AP reports.\nHowever, Trump defended the idea – what would amount to a US President accepting a valuable gift from a foreign government – as a fiscally shrewd move for the country.\n“So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,” Trump posted on social media.\n      Support your Jewish community.

(AP/Alex Brandon)\nSaudi Arabia and fellow OPEC+ nations have already helped their cause with Trump early in his second term by stepping up oil production. Trump sees cheap energy as a key component to lowering costs and stemming inflation for Americans. The US president has also made the case that lower oil prices will hasten an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine.\nBut Saudi Arabia’s economy remains heavily dependent on oil, and the kingdom needs a fiscal break-even oil price of $96 to $98 a barrel to balance its budget. It’s questionable how long OPEC+, of which Saudi Arabia is the leading member, is willing to keep production elevated. The price of a barrel of Brent crude closed Monday at $64.77.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“One of the challenges for the Gulf states of lower oil prices is it doesn’t necessarily imperil economic diversification programs, but it certainly makes them harder,” said Jon Alterman, a senior Middle East analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\nTrump picked the kingdom for his first stop because it has pledged to make big investments in the US, but Trump ended up traveling to Italy last month for Pope Francis’ funeral.

They include a high-rise tower in Jeddah, a luxury hotel in Dubai and a golf course and villa complex in Qatar.\nTrump is trying to demonstrate that his transactional strategy for international politics is paying dividends as he faces criticism from Democrats who say his global tariff war and approach to Russia’s war on Ukraine are isolating the United States from allies.\nHe’s expected to announce deals with the three wealthy countries that will touch on artificial intelligence, expanding energy cooperation and perhaps new arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The administration earlier this month announced initial approval to sell $3.5 billion worth of air-to-air missiles for Saudi Arabia’s fighter jets.\nBut Trump arrives in the Mideast at a moment when his top regional allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia, are far from neatly aligned with his approach.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA handout picture provided by the Saudi Royal Palace shows Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (C-R) meeting with US President Donald Trump (C-L) in Riyadh on May 13, 2025. (BANDAR AL-JALOUD / Saudi Royal Palace / AFP)\nAhead of the trip, Trump announced that the US was halting a nearly two-month US airstrike campaign against Yemen’s Houthis, saying the Iran-backed rebels have pledged to stop attacking ships along a vital global trade route.\nThe administration didn’t notify Israel — which the Houthis continue to target — of the agreement before Trump publicly announced it. It was the latest example of Trump leaving the Israelis in the dark about his administration’s negotiations with common adversaries.\nIn March, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t notified by the administration until after direct talks began with Hamas about the war in Gaza. And Netanyahu found out about the ongoing US nuclear talks with Iran only ahead of Trump announcing them during an Oval Office visit by the Israeli leader last month.\n“Israel will defend itself by itself,” Netanyahu said last week following Trump’s Houthi truce announcement. “If others join us — our American friends — all the better.”\nIsrael was again left out of the loop as Trump negotiated the release of US-Israeli hostage soldier Edan Alexander, who had been held captive by Hamas for over 580 days after being captured during the October 7, 2023 attack.\nAlexander returned to Israel on Monday, a day before Trump arrived in the region, and his release was the result of direct US-Hamas talks, in negotiations that sidelined Israeli officials, who were updated only after the deal was struck.\nA billboard bearing a picture depicting US President Donald Trump shaking hands with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with the slogan “history won’t wait” is seen on the facade of a hotel building in Jerusalem on May 12, 2025.

Trump’s Abraham Accords effort led to Sudan, the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco agreeing to normalize relations with Israel.\nBut Riyadh has made clear that in exchange for normalization it wants US security guarantees, assistance with the kingdom’s nuclear program and progress on a pathway to Palestinian statehood. There seems to be scant hope for making headway on a Palestinian state with the Israel-Hamas war raging and Israel’s plans to significantly expand the IDF’s offensive operations in Gaza.\nBin Salman last week notably hosted Palestinian Authority Vice President Hussein Sheikh in Jeddah on Sheikh’s first foreign visit since assuming office in April.\nHussain Abdul-Hussain, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the crown prince appeared to be subtly signaling to Trump that the kingdom needs to see progress on Palestinian statehood for the Saudis to begin seriously moving on a normalization deal with the Israelis.\nUS President Donald Trump gestures as he exits his plane upon arriving at the airport in Riyadh on May 13, 2025.

If Sinwar was indeed in the tunnel, as the military’s intelligence indicated, he was likely killed, the sources said, adding that there was a small window of opportunity for the strike.\nThe IDF said it took steps to mitigate civilian harm in the strike, including by using precision munitions, aerial surveillance, and other intelligence.\n“The Hamas terror organization continues to use hospitals in the Gaza Strip for terror purposes, cynically and cruelly exploiting the civilian population in and around the hospital,” the military said.\nSeveral hours after the initial attack, Palestinian media reported additional strikes in the area of the hospital, in what appeared to be an attempt by the IDF to prevent anyone from approaching the tunnel where Sinwar was targeted.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSinwar, a senior Hamas military commander, is the younger brother of the former Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by the IDF in southern Gaza last October.\nFollowing the killing of Hamas’s top military commander, Muhammad Deif, last July, Muhammad Sinwar took charge of the terror group’s military wing. Later, after Sinwar’s older brother was killed by IDF troops, he became the de facto leader of the terror group in the Gaza Strip.\nIsraeli officials have described Muhammad Sinwar as obstinate with regard to negotiations with Hamas for the release of hostages, and an obstacle to reaching a ceasefire deal.\nThe younger Sinwar is also wanted for terrorist actions against Israel and has been active in Hamas for decades.\nHe was jailed by Israel in the 1990s for nine months and spent an additional three years in a Palestinian Authority prison in Ramallah, from which he escaped in 2000. In 2006, Sinwar was part of a Hamas cell that abducted IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. He also previously commanded Hamas’s Khan Younis Brigade.\nMost of Hamas’s leadership has been eliminated by Israel during the ongoing war, which was sparked when the terror group stormed southern Israel on October 7, 2023, to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages.\nOn Tuesday, the IDF and Shin Bet confirmed that an overnight strike killed Hassan Eslaiah, who had joined and recorded the shock assault. The security forces said he was a Hamas operative “operating under the guise of a journalist.”\nThe statement followed Palestinian reports that Eslaiah had been killed in the strike on Khan Younis’s Nasser Hospital, a month after he had survived a previous Israeli targeting.\nEslaiah, whose freelance photography was distributed around the world for the Associated Press, had photographed Gazans, some of them armed, as they stormed Kibbutz Nir Oz, where a quarter of the population was slaughtered or kidnapped, including the elderly and children as young as nine months old.\nHe also took a picture of Gazans atop a burning tank next to the destroyed Gaza border fence. A video from the scene posted to social media and since deleted showed him next to the tank; no press credentials could be seen on him.\nThe IDF said last month that he was a member of Hamas’s Khan Younis Brigade.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFreelance journalist Hassan Eslaiah, whom the IDF has indentifed as a member of the Hamas terror group’s Khan Younis Brigade, is seen in front of a burning IDF tank during the October 7, 2023, onslaught.

Palestinian media reported that he was receiving medical care at Nasser Hospital from injuries sustained in the previous strike when he was killed.\nBoth the AP and CNN said in November 2023 that they had severed their relationship with Eslaiah after a pro-Israel watchdog raised questions about their work with the photographer and other journalists who entered Israel during the massacre.\nIsrael has repeatedly alleged that journalists killed in strikes were actually terror operatives who posed as reporters; it maintains that Hamas uses hospitals, schools, shelters, and aid infrastructure as cover for terror activities.\nNurit Yohanan contributed to this report."}

By that point, they had fired over 40 ballistic missiles and dozens of attack drones and cruise missiles at Israel, including one that killed a civilian and wounded several others in Tel Aviv in July, prompting Israel’s first strike in Yemen.\nSince March 18, when the IDF resumed its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis in Yemen have launched 31 ballistic missiles and at least 10 drones at Israel.

Its activities will include monitoring court cases related to anti-Jewish crimes, giving advice on executive orders and legislation, and liaising with the New York City Law Department, the department that handles most of the city’s legal affairs.\nThe antisemitism bureau will also have the authority to enforce a ban on antisemitism at city-funded agencies. Recent incidents at city agencies include a New York City Department of Education office sending out a toolkit with antisemitic language, and a city parks office booking Kehlani, an anti-Israel singer who has called for an intifada and the destruction of Israel. Kehlani’s Central Park concert was canceled amid pressure from the mayor’s office.\nAdams appointed Moshe Davis, his Jewish liaison since 2022, to head the new office. Davis will start by forming a commission of New York City Jewish leaders to advise the new bureau. Davis will report to Randy Mastro, the city’s first deputy mayor.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“This office will be a sledgehammer: deliberate, coordinated and unapologetic,” Davis said at a Tuesday press briefing. “We’re all in the same boat. This isn’t a Jewish issue, this is a New York issue.”\nThe mayor’s office cited the high rate of antisemitism as a reason for establishing the office. Last year, 54% of all hate crimes in New York City targeted Jews, and during the first quarter of this year, that figure climbed to 62%, according to NYPD data. Jews represent around 10% of the city population.\n“This moment calls for decisive action,” Adams said in a statement. “Antisemitism is an attack not only on Jewish New Yorkers, but on the very idea of New York City as a place where people from all backgrounds can live together.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdams announced the task force at a Monday briefing in City Hall, flanked by Hasidic, Orthodox, and secular community leaders, including representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York, and the UJA-Federation of New York.\nAdams, a former NYPD officer and Brooklyn borough president, has strong ties to New York Jewish communities, particularly in Brooklyn, and is a vocal supporter of Israel and the Jewish community. He announced the task force while standing next to Devorah Halberstam, whose son, Ari, was murdered in an antisemitic attack in 1994. Adams and Halberstam have been close since then.\nIn 2023, Adams formed the city’s first Jewish Advisory Council, a group charged with improving Jewish life in the city. Another program, called Breaking Bread, Building Bonds, is aimed at combating hatred more generally.\nThe Trump administration established a federal antisemitism task force in February.\nAdams’s predecessor Bill de Blasio opened the city’s Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes in 2019, largely in response to antisemitism. Adams said the new task force will complement the hate crimes unit.\nMoshe Davis, center, the head of New York City’s new antisemitism task force, at a briefing announcing the creation of the task force at City Hall, New York City, May 13, 2025. (Luke Tress/Times of Israel)\nThe new office’s scope extends beyond hate crimes with its oversight of city agencies.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“There are many rivers that feed the sea of antisemitism,” Adams said, citing rhetoric at schools and colleges. “We have to proactively monitor what is leaving our agencies. We cannot be the feeder of hate.”\nThe broader focus could cause conflicts as the office navigates the line between anti-Israel speech and antisemitism. Jewish New Yorkers have been unnerved by hundreds of anti-Israel protests on city streets since October 7, including in Jewish neighborhoods. Adams has defended the right to protest and criticize Israel, including on Tuesday.\n“You have a right to free speech and you have a right to have your opinion,” he said. “We want to make sure that free speech does not cross the line into hate.”\nThe details of the task force’s oversight of city agencies remain unclear. Davis declined to confirm whether the new office will adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which covers some forms of Israel criticism. There will be further details available about the task force’s protocols in the coming weeks, he said.\nAdams said that advocating for Palestinians does not constitute antisemitism, but indicated he personally views anti-Zionism as antisemitic.\n“If you’re saying, ‘Eradicate Israel, destroy Israel,’ I mean, who lives in Israel?” Adams said. “If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, call it a duck.”\nAdams has been battered over corruption allegations and his ties to the Trump administration in the past year.\nHe is up for reelection in November. The city’s Democratic Party primary, which typically decides who will win the general election in the mostly Democratic city, will take place next month. Adams announced last month that he will run as an independent.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFormer New York governor Andrew Cuomo has a commanding lead in polls for the primary, and has also been pitching to Jewish voters and prioritizing the fight against antisemitism, making several stops at synagogues in recent weeks.\nAdams has reportedly petitioned to run in the mayoral race on an “EndAntiSemitism” ballot line.\nJews have been disproportionately targeted in hate crimes in New York for years, including before the October 2023 Hamas attack. When de Blasio announced the Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes, Jews were also targeted in 60% of hate crimes. Adams said the task force was starting this week, despite that history, as part of a long “evolution” in his approach to combating hate."}

Koller is packing up from New York City, where he has taught at Yeshiva University, specializing in Hebrew from biblical to medieval texts, since earning his doctorate there in 2009.\nAccording to Koller, it’s no surprise that Jews never made the cut before. Henry VIII, who founded the Church of England along with the professorship, intended it for Anglican churchmen to teach Hebrew in the Anglican tradition. That idea lasted until recently.\n“Fifty years ago, it wouldn’t have struck anyone as odd that no Jewish person had held the position,” Koller said in an interview. “It was pretty clearly — not officially, but very clearly — meant for an Anglican professor of the Old Testament.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nKoller — who spent the 2022-23 academic year in Cambridge — credits his predecessor, Geoffrey Khan, with breaking the mold. Khan is not a member of the Anglican Church nor a specialist in the Old Testament, but a scholar of Semitic languages with mixed British, Indian and Iranian ancestry.\nIn this Tuesday Aug. 25, 2009 file photo, tourists enjoy a boat ride on the river Cam, in Cambridge, England. (AP Photo/Lefteris Pitarakis, File)\nIn his new role, Koller wants to promote the study of Hebrew texts over the thousands of years between the Hebrew Bible and the modern state of Israel, drawing on Cambridge’s rich trove of manuscripts that includes the Cairo Genizah, the vast collection of medieval manuscripts discovered in Egypt in the late 19th century. Koller hopes that introducing students to these writings will open them up to new angles of studying cultural and intellectual history across the world.\nDespite being the first Jewish Regius professor, Koller said he is wary of narrowing the department around “Jewish studies for the Jews.” In the United States, Jewish studies departments tend to attract Jewish students looking to connect with their identity and heritage. That fills a valuable need, said Koller, but he wants to build out Hebrew studies as a home for any student with a humanistic interest in Hebrew — addressing the same historical and philosophical questions that draw people to studying ancient Greek or Latin.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“No one thinks that Greek studies would only be for Greeks,” he said. “Greek studies spend a lot of time trying to explain to the world that this is of universal significance. It’s not for every single person, but it’s for any given person; [they] will find something interesting here. And I very much want to do the same for Hebrew studies in Cambridge.”\nAs far as faculty representation, there is still progress to be made in the Regius Professorship.\n“There still hasn’t been a woman in the position,” said Koller. “That’s yet to be solved.”"}

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is already on rocky ground due to its failure so far to pass legislation reestablishing yeshiva students’ exemptions from military service, which were struck down by the High Court last year.\nIn a statement, the IDF said, “Last night, there was an [arrest] operation close to the draft period as has been carried out previously, in an equal manner across all segments of society and against anyone who did not show up as required.”\nThe comment came after reports claimed that the army would launch large-scale arrest raids on Wednesday targeting Haredi draft dodgers.\nThe army said the campaign on Monday night was aimed at a total of 36 people evading conscription, and not just ultra-Orthodox men.

(Tomer Neuberg/Flash90)\nThe detainees would either face disciplinary measures or a criminal trial, depending on how long they had ignored draft orders. In general, Military Police arrest campaigns are aimed at those who ignore recent draft orders, and therefore only face disciplinary — not criminal — measures.\nIt was the third arrest campaign against draft dodgers since the beginning of the war, with the previous ones taking place in November 2024 and March 2025, according to the army.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe military noted that last week, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir instructed the Personnel Directorate to come up with a plan to send out more draft orders to members of the ultra-Orthodox community\n“The plan is currently being prepared,” the IDF said.\nSpeaking with the Haredi news site Kikar Hashabbat last week, UTJ lawmaker Yaakov Asher warned that if the Knesset did not pass draft exemption legislation by the end of the summer session, on July 27, his party would no longer be able to remain in the government.\n“If this law does not pass in this session… we will have a very big problem sitting in such a government, period,” he said, adding that UTJ “cannot be part of a government” that turns Haredim into “criminals.”\nUltra-Orthodox soldiers are drafted into the military at an induction center, April 28, 2025. (Israel Defense Forces)\nShas and United Torah Judaism are currently boycotting private member bills brought by members of the coalition in an effort to pressure Netanyahu to push the controversial enlistment legislation through.\nWith the news that the IDF plans on significantly increasing enforcement, many in the Haredi community are “very worried,” Yisroel Cohen, an ultra-Orthodox journalist with close ties to the Haredi parties, told The Times of Israel on Tuesday.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“It could bring this whole story to an explosive end. If they arrest even one or two yeshiva students in the street, it could bring about a big crisis, even potentially prompting the Haredim to dismantle the government,” he said.\n“If they go to the yeshivas, it will breach every red line,” Cohen added.\nSenior ultra-Orthodox political officials informed Netanyahu on Tuesday that the launch of a large-scale enforcement operation against Haredi draft dodgers could bring about their “immediate resignation from the government,” national broadcaster Kan reported.\nSpeaking with the Ynet news site, a senior Haredi party official declared that “if dozens and hundreds of yeshiva students are indeed arrested, as we are currently seeing, these will be the government’s final days.”\nSimilarly, an unnamed United Torah Judaism official told Army Radio that “as soon as there is one arrest tomorrow, we will shut down the government and begin the dissolution process.”\nThis rhetoric echoed Shas chairman Aryeh Deri’s statement last month that the government would not survive the arrest of yeshiva students.\n“As long as… there is no proactive action by the state to arrest yeshiva students, we will continue to be part of the government, but as soon as there is such an arrest, even one… that is a red line for us,” Deri told his ultra-Orthodox party’s HaDerech newspaper.”We will not be able to continue to be a part of such a government.”\nMK Aryeh Deri attends a plenum session at the Knesset in Jerusalem on February 10, 2025.(Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nUnlike the Haredim, the leaders of the Knesset opposition welcomed the operation, with Opposition Leader Yair Lapid tweeting that “the Military Police are not ‘arresting Haredim,’ they are arresting young Israelis who received a draft order during the war and did not show up at the military induction base to enlist in the defense of the country.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The law is the law, recruitment is recruitment, and equality is equality. Don’t stop, recruit everyone,” tweeted The Democrats chairman Yair Golan.\nMilitary officials have acknowledged that in practice, the IDF had not been enforcing the draft orders it was sending out to Haredim.\n“We don’t enforce the draft orders for the ultra-Orthodox enough. There is almost no enforcement of them,” an official told reporters earlier this week.\n“We don’t want Military Police battalions to storm Bnei Brak, Modi’in Illit, and Beitar Illit,” the official said, referring to three major ultra-Orthodox cities. “We want to increase enforcement, but it’s difficult for us.”\nNormally, after ignoring two draft orders, a potential conscript receives an immediate call-up order and must show up at an induction center within 48 hours or be declared a draft evader.\nThe consequences of being declared a draft evader include receiving a “no exit order” — being barred from leaving the country. In addition, during any encounter with the police, the draft dodger can be arrested. The exact timeline between the draft orders varies.\nUltra-Orthodox Jews protest the IDF draft outside the Jerusalem enlistment center, April 28, 2025. (Sam Sokol/Times of Israel)\nCurrently, approximately 80,000 Haredi men between the ages of 18 and 24 are eligible for military service and have not enlisted.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe IDF in the coming weeks will complete sending out draft orders to 24,000 Haredi men, wrapping up an effort that began last summer but has seen only a handful enlist. As of late April, only 232 of those who have received orders have enlisted — 57 of them in combat roles.\nIn total, just over 1,800 Haredim have enlisted in the IDF since last summer, far fewer than the military’s goal of 4,800.\nAs of early February, arrest warrants had been issued for 1,212 Haredim who ignored multiple enlistment orders, a number that has likely increased in the interim.\nDuring a discussion in the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee last week, Brig. Gen. Shay Tayeb, head of the IDF Personnel Directorate’s Planning and Personnel Management Division, told lawmakers the IDF has three main enforcement mechanisms: stopping people at Ben Gurion Airport, random police checks, and dedicated operations against evaders.\nSuch operations have been limited over the last year and a half as the bulk of the Military Police’s resources have been tied up in imprisoning captured terrorists, he said.\nAccording to Tayeb, since the beginning of the year, 340 Israelis who received military draft orders and dodged service were detained while trying to leave the country — 52 of whom had recently received orders as part of an effort to recruit ultra-Orthodox men. Of those who were detained, 23 have since been drafted to the IDF, he said.\nBrig. Gen. Shay Tayeb, head of the IDF Personnel Directorate’s Planning and Personnel Management Division, addresses the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, May 8, 2025. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nSpeaking with the committee last month, Lt. Col. Avigdor Dickstein, head of the Haredi branch of the IDF’s Personnel Directorate, seemed to indicate that the army sees large-scale arrest operations as ineffective.\n“Currently, the most significant and effective sanction is Ben Gurion Airport; there is currently no other sanction,” Dickstein asserted. “There is the ability to make arrests, but it is extremely ineffective. If I grab him and put him in a police car, will he end up enlisting?”\nSpeaking with The Times of Israel last week, former IDF chief military defense counsel Col. (res.) Ran Cohen Rochverger alleged that from November 2023 until this April, the military had significantly increased penalties for desertion against regular service and reserve troops, without a corresponding change in legal consequences for draft evaders.\nThe Ynet news site recently reported that the IDF had been in contact with the Justice Ministry to discuss the use of available sanctions, including ones that could have a significant economic impact on evaders.\nUnder existing laws, it is possible to block draft dodgers from obtaining drivers licenses, receiving passports or renewing their state identification cards, Deputy Knesset Speaker Evgeny Sova told The Times of Israel on Tuesday.\n“You can do that today, but the state doesn’t do it,” he said. “But you can’t carry on with your life, use state services in a normal and regular way without actually settling this matter.”\nUltra-Orthodox soldiers draft to the IDF’s new Haredi brigade, known as the Hasmonean Brigade, January 5, 2025. (Israel Defense Forces)\nThe government has also done little, if anything, to combat those actively encouraging yeshiva students to dodge the draft.\nSince the High Court of Justice’s ruling in June 2024 ending the exemption of Haredim from military service, multiple initiatives affiliated with various Haredi factions have sprung up to guide young men through their new post-exemption reality, and encourage them to disregard IDF enlistment orders.\nThe Israel Police and the attorney general appear to have failed to crack down on such groups, despite demands for investigation by advocacy groups and lawmakers. Under the law, someone inciting others to evade service during wartime is liable for a prison term of 15 years."}

After legal pressure, the government agreed to have their qualifications vetted too.\nBut following petitions by government watchdogs, the court on Monday ruled that such a system still did not include sufficient guardrails to guarantee the independence, impartiality and apolitical nature of the Civil Service commissioner role, and neither would it ensure that the best candidate would be appointed to the job.\nWriting for the majority, Supreme Court President Isaac Amit acknowledged that the Civil Service Law states explicitly that there is no obligation to issue a public tender for the position, something which could, in theory, legitimize the government’s method of picking one candidate for approval, without having a competitive process.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nHe wrote, however, that this did not exempt the government from abiding by the principles of administrative law when passing cabinet resolutions.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leads a government meeting at the IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv on December 31, 2023.

Following October 7th, pro-Palestinian activists and post-colonial academics erupted in a jubilation born out of misidentifying Hamas’ horrific atrocities as acts of liberation and anti-colonialism. The alliance of post-colonial academics and pro-Palestinians activists that brought about this bizarre and troubling occurrence has been decades in the making. It stands on the misinformed claim that Zionism is a settler-colonial enterprise. The post-colonial phenomenon is bizarre, marginal and peripherical to Israelis. However, it is increasingly influential in world public opinion and requires engagement and investigation as to its origination, enablement and implications.\n—————-\nThe myth that Israel is a settler-colonialist and apartheid state is a product of a decades-long trajectory that stands on the embrace of variants of Post-Colonialism, Critical Race Theory and Intersectionality by many in the cultural and political left. These academic constructs have led many to the worldview that humanity as divided into two clearly delineated groups of people: oppressors (white people) and victims (people of color) – a simplistic juxtaposition that is blind to the facts and complexities that characterize reality. Settler colonialism, a specific variant of this narrative, has gained prominence and it has been deployed to characterize Israel as the quintessential illegitimate state, born out of the dispossession of the native population by a foreign colonizing group.\nSettler-colonialism theory stipulates that countries that originated in colonial settlement are permanently illegitimate. Most colonies were founded by colonial powers with the intent of settling their populations and/or extracting local resources. Anti-settler-colonial activism goes back to the decolonization era of the 1950s and 60s when it was applied to countries like Algeria, Rhodesia and South Africa. In these countries a small European population of foreign settlers ruled over and exploited, a much larger native population. This definition fits more than one hundred countries worldwide. Australia, the USA and Canada were the first countries to be targeted by post-colonial activists – reflecting the guilt of the academic class over the sins of their countries of birth.\nThe simplistic and disingenuous juxtaposition of Israel “oppressor-white-wrong” vs the Palestinian “oppressed-non-white-right” veils a complex reality where two sides have been fighting one hundred years for self-determination on the same land. To the post-colonial gurus, Jews and the state of Israel are “white.” Thus, they are oppressors and always in the wrong. This narrative persists despite the fact that Jews originate in Canaan, not Europe, and 65% of the Jewish population of Israel is “non-white” by demographic standards.\nThe unique case of Zionism (i.e. the return of the original, Jewish and indigenous people to their homeland) does not fit the settler-colonial mold. Nonetheless, Palestinian activists have been successful in forming an alliance with post-colonial academics by promoting the falsehood of Zionism as a colonial enterprise. This disingenuous delegitimization, and signaling-out of Israel, has been successful among much of the political left due to ignorance about the Zionist movement. Confusion among its adherents, who do not differentiate between Zionism and the current Israeli settlements in the West bank, is rampant. This label has been internalized by much of left-leaning academia and the cultural left. It has lead to the belief that Israel is a colonial settler enterprise and to the belief that the atrocities committed by Hamas on October the 7th, are either defensible or a justifiable act of resistance to oppression.\nThe Jews are native and indigenous to the land between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean Sea. Contrary to the settler-colonialist concept, Zionism is the fulfillment and implementation of the right of return of the Jewish people to its homeland – not a settler-colonial enterprise. During the long exile, Jews yearned and prayed for the return to their homeland. The current state of Israel is the last stage of a 3000 years-old quest by the Hebrew nation for national self determination in its ancestral land. This quest is among the oldest and most persistent struggles known to mankind for nationhood and sovereignty.\nFurthermore, The Bible, revered by more than half of the world’s population, records the first millennium of this quest and underwrites and legitimates the yearning for the return of the Jews to their native homeland. A vast religious and cultural tradition and a vast literary, archeological and documentary testimony of continuous attachment and presence in the land further substantiate and corroborate the Jewish yearning and claim to a homeland in the land of Canaan-Palestine.\nMoreover, it is noteworthy that most of the non-European members of the United Nations are the result of settler-colonialist migrations, and many are former colonies. During the colonialist era (15-20th centuries) most of the European countries established colonies throughout the world: United Kingdom: 130, France: 90, Portugal: 52, Spain: 44, Netherlands: 29, Germany: 20, Russia: 17, Denmark: 9, Sweden: 8, Italy: 7, Norway: 6, Belgium: 3. Thus, given the large number of unequivocal settler-colonial societies that populate the planet – the current focus of the post-colonial movement on anti-Zionism is peculiar and invites scrutiny. Having this vast array of better fitting targets, the current obsession of post-colonial academics with Zionism is intriguing and worthy of investigation.\nFurthermore, the recent history of the establishment of the third Jewish state (1948 to present) further debunks the claims of settler-colonialist academics:\nThe British Mandate in Palestine (a mandate, not a colony) was established by The League of Nations (1920) after World War I, following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire by the Allied forces. The mandate aimed to implement the establishment of a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine.\nBritain’s actual policies diverged from the League of Nations’ unequivocal mandate. At first, Britain facilitated the return of the Jews to their homeland (1920-1936). However, during the following period (1939-1947) Britain opposed it to gain favor with the Arabs who were inclined to support the Germans.\nThe settler-colonial mislabeling of Zionism is a marriage of convenience between pro-Palestinian activists and post-colonial misdirected anger about the excesses and crimes of colonial powers throughout history. Post-colonialists should embrace and showcase Zionism as a successful de-colonizing enterprise where the victims of empire and colonialism gained nationhood despite 2000 years of exile, persecution, discrimination, yearning and despair.\nTo the detailed research paper that anchors this article."}

Will Netanyahu allow it?", "media_type": "blog", "date": "MAY 12, 2025, 6:51 AM", "content": "The direct negotiation between the Trump administration and Hamas is one of the lowest, most disloyal, and unethical moves that a so-called “ally” could ever conduct. According to the latest news, American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander could be released in the next 24-48 hours and US special envoy, Steven Witkoff, is set to arrive in Israel on Monday to facilitate the release. It also emerged that the US did not brief Israel on the efforts to release Alexander until after reaching the deal, basically conducting everything behind Israel’s back.\nOn Sunday, during a meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu did not rule out the possibility that Hamas would release Alexander “as a gesture to the Americans”. Was the Israeli government aware of the negotiations? Even if not, the scenario was at least predictable, since Trump had already turned his back on Israel a few days ago by suddenly cutting a deal with the Houthis, as long as US ships would not be targeted. The path taken with Hamas seems to be very similar. Is this what “America first” means?\nIndeed, Hamas is cleverly exploiting the situation to obtain four main objectives: widening the rift between the Trump administration and Israel, stopping Israel from launching the alleged wide scale operation that Netanyahu has been announcing, allowing aid into Gaza and possibly ending the war with the reassurance that the terrorist organization will be allowed to play some role in the post-war Gaza.\nTrump, on the other hand, needs to present himself as a great friend of the Arab world in his upcoming visit to the Middle East because he desperately needs to cut business deals with the three main energy-rich Arab nations in the area: Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.\nAs CNN reported, these three countries “are racing to turn their influence over Donald Trump into tangible gains. They have built personal ties with the president and collectively pledged trillions in US investments while casting themselves as key intermediaries in conflicts Trump wants to resolve, from Gaza to Ukraine and Iran.” Let’s not forget the recent rumors about Trump renaming the Persian Gulf as “Gulf of Arabia” and even potentially recognizing a Palestinian state. Overall, it’s a win-win situation for everyone, except for Israel who is being sacrificed by its closest ally, because Trump needs to cut deals.\nOn Sunday evening, the Times of Israel revealed that a source involved in the mediation stated that Hamas has received assurances from the US through mediators that Alexander’s release “would go a long way” with US President Donald Trump who wants to see the remaining hostages released and for the war in Gaza to end.\nThe situation is very ugly; the Trump administration directly engaged with a Palestinian terrorist organization blacklisted by the US itself; an organization that perpetrated the worst pogrom against the Jews since the Holocaust. Trump’s men negotiated the release of only one hostage, the only US citizen, therefore discriminating between American and non-American Jews. Is this the kind of support expected from a so-called “ally”? How could the relatives of the other hostages still held by Hamas feel?\nFurthermore, by directly engaging with Hamas and cutting a deal, Trump is legitimizing and empowering the Palestinian terrorist organization while indirectly encouraging other nations to recognize Hamas as a legitimate political entity rather than for what it really is, a ruthless terrorist organization. Hamas will now be encouraged to perpetrate more terror attacks because it feels reassured by Trump’s reckless policy.\nTrump seems unable or unwilling to distinguish between agreement and business deals with legitimate partners and negotiating with a terrorist entity, and that is a very significant problem for the international war on terror and also for US international credibility.\nWill Trump succeed in pressuring Israel to cease the military offensive against what remains of Hamas or even end the war? It is now up to PM Benjamin Netanyahu. The right thing to do would be to rapidly launch the wide-scale military operation in Gaza that has been announced and finish the job with Hamas; something that should have already been done months ago.\nThe longer the situation in Gaza drags on, the worse it will be for Israel, both domestically and internationally, from both an economic and a diplomatic perspective. Hamas must be quickly removed and a new phase must be reached to no longer allow Israel’s enemies to exploit the crisis in Gaza to accuse Israel of “genocide”, “ethnic cleansing” and so on.\nUnfortunately, the impression is that there has never been a real will, on Netanyahu’s part, to eradicate Hamas from Gaza. The war has been conducted in fits and starts, which is detrimental to the troops’ morale and to the image of the IDF. The numerous announcements of an imminent military ground operation that would have suffocated Hamas have not been followed up on a practical level. In short, something is not working on both sides, both on the American side and on the Israeli side."}

While all open positions are important, many can carry different business values and impacts. These workflows can actively assess the relative importance of each position to aid recruiters in spreading their efforts more effectively. \nThis helps organizations to maximize their return on investment based on the business value that successful hires bring to the business. \nTools like the IBM platform are already making use of workflow intelligence by leveraging cloud and technology-agnostic infrastructure to deliver advanced recruiting solutions in competitive markets. \nEnhanced Efficiency\nOne key advantage of incorporating automation technology into remote recruitment strategies is the pace at which it can process significant volumes of data. \nArtificial intelligence algorithms are capable of scanning thousands of resumes and job applications almost instantly, identifying the most qualified candidates throughout a global talent pool regardless of the native language of the CV in question. \nThis can help to enhance Israel’s existing staff outsourcing schemes, such as its scheme to recruit Indian workers that some talented employees have suggested could benefit from improvements in matching talent to their strongest roles. \nCrucially, this technology can alleviate hours of manual labor for recruiters, helping HR professionals to allocate more time towards strategic tasks. \nIsraeli organizations can use automation tools to quickly tap into vast international talent pools to efficiently recruit criteria-fitting remote talent from across the world. \nPredictive People Analytics\nPeople analytics is a powerful automation tool for HR teams, and artificial intelligence can help more businesses analyze historical data to forecast candidate success following the onboarding process. \nEmpowering recruiters with greater analytical intelligence surrounding candidate capabilities, they can play a pivotal role in driving effective hires while lowering instances of employee turnover. \nThe ability to examine and review patterns from a company’s previous hires means that machine learning algorithms can identify the traits of successful hires and high-performing workers to leverage a strong alignment of skills and soft skills that can be integrated into the company culture. \nMachine learning has the power to not only identify candidates that align with the business but also explore prospects for internal promotions and alert HR professionals to early signs of underperformance throughout the existing workforce, helping to fully future-proof operations. \nVirtual Candidate Screening\nArtificial intelligence can also automate the candidate screening process for remote roles where in-person interviews aren’t possible.\n  Because it can be a significant challenge to take meaningful impressions from a video interview, AI solutions have the ability to assess a candidate’s responses in real-time, analyzing facial expressions and tone to assess soft skills in communications and personability and determine whether each candidate would be a suitable cultural fit. \nArtificial intelligence video interviews are not only an effective tool for fully assessing the tangible and intangible qualities of candidates, but they can also be deployed in the relevant time zone for interviewees and in a native language to develop a comprehensive assessment. \nEliminating Bias\nTechnology also plays a pivotal role in stamping out unconscious bias from staff outsourcing. \nThe initial screening phase can be prone to bias from recruiters, but AI systems can provide an all-important objective view of candidates based on factors such as education, experience, and relevant credentials. \nAlthough artificial intelligence models are only as objective as the data that’s been used to train them, well-sourced AI models can ensure that all applications are fairly evaluated using the same assessment criteria and on their role suitability alone. \nBorderless Talent Sourcing\nAutomation technology will transform the ways that Israeli businesses source talent at scale, opening the door to greater accuracy and efficiency when recruiting new team members from overseas. \nThis borderless approach to outsourcing means that recruiters can benefit from far greater accuracy throughout all stages of the acquisition and onboarding process, paving the way for lower rates of employee turnover and greater job satisfaction in the process. \nThe age of automation is only getting started, and in terms of its raw power to attract and onboard global talent, the benefits can seem limitless."}

Oriel Bibi, 30, an officer in the Paratroopers Brigade, from Shlomit, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nOriel was home the morning of the attack in Shlomit, a small town near the Egyptian border. He was called up with the start of the Hamas onslaught and was heading towards his base, near Kibbutz Shomria, in order to get armed and head to the front lines for battle.\nOn the way to the base, he encountered a cell of Hamas terrorists at the Ma’on Junction not far from Kibbutz Nir Oz. He was shot in the neck but managed to tie a tourniquet and keep fighting until he succumbed to his wounds. His family was not informed that he was killed until three days later.\nOriel was buried in Kfar Saba on October 10.

About a month before Oriel was killed, the family moved into their new home in the community.\nNechama told Ynet that the morning of the attack, at 6:40 a.m., as she was sitting in complete darkness in their reinforced room, “Oriel entered with his tallit, in an image I’ll never forget. He opened the door and a wave of light came inside. He looked for a moment like an angel.”\nHis sister, Ortal, said at a memorial that her brother was all about “giving to others. Oriel was a great man of small deeds that are expected of all of us, but we all know it’s hard to do them… He did so many things that other people don’t do,” she said, including always calling loved ones for their birthdays and memorializing the fallen. “It was important to him that in every family trip, we would visit a memorial, he always said that we are here thanks to those who are no longer with us.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

She was murdered in captivity in August 2024 and her body was recovered soon after by IDF troops and returned to Israel.\nCarmel was visiting her parents that holiday weekend when the Hamas onslaught began. Her mother, Kinneret Gat, was slain in the attack.\nHer sister-in-law, Yarden Roman-Gat, was also kidnapped during the attack, while Carmel’s brother Alon and the niece Geffen managed to escape before being captured. Yarden was released from captivity in November 2023 as part of a weeklong ceasefire deal.\nReleased hostages said they had spent time in captivity with Carmel, and that she had even done daily yoga with the younger hostages before they were freed.\nIn August 2024, Carmel was executed by her Hamas captors alongside fellow hostages Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Ori Danino, Almog Sarusi and Alex Lobanov. The IDF announced on September 1, 2024, that they had recovered their bodies in Rafah.\nAn investigation found that they were murdered by their captors just 48-72 hours before their bodies were found by troops, likely on August 29, 2024.\nCarmel was buried next to her mother in Kibbutz Be’eri on September 2, 2024. She is survived by her father, Eshel, and her younger brothers Alon and Or.\nBorn and raised in Kibbutz Be’eri, the oldest in the family, Carmel – known to friends as Melly – was a doting big sister who sought to instill a cultural education in her younger brothers, according to a kibbutz eulogy. She was opinionated, stuck to her guns and had a well-developed sense of justice, her loved ones said.\nAs a young adult she moved to Tel Aviv, living with roommates and meeting her longtime partner, Ruvi. She worked in a variety of jobs, delivering sandwiches to offices, serving as an aide to disabled university students and working as an au pair.\nEventually she got a bachelor’s degree in occupational therapy at Tel Aviv University and began working in the field. When she was killed, she was just about to start her second year in a master’s degree at Hebrew University in therapy and occupational therapy. She loved podcasts and music, as well as dancing and drinking wine along the beach.\nLess than six months before she was killed, she broke up with Ruvi after 14 years and traveled to India for several months – returning to Israel on October 1, 2023. That weekend, she was slated to reunite with her whole family – including her beloved niece.\n“The Carmel I knew was a woman of truth and compassion – you can see this even through the photos,” her friend Vita Kairys wrote in Haaretz. “The Carmel I knew constantly insisted on living the good life. Not in the bourgeois sense of material abundance, but in the sense of belonging and meaning.”\nVita said Carmel “made courageous choices in her personal life, not out of bluntness or a defiance, but rather out of curiosity and confidence in the world. When something didn’t work out, she simply went on to examine another possibility.”\nIn a eulogy read at her funeral, her brothers, Ori and Alon, spoke of “how much we need you here now to give us a hug. To look us in the eyes. To be with us. To give us strength.”\n“You brought so much beauty and light and variety and love to the world, to us,” they added. “We took so much inspiration from you. We drew so much strength from you, even when you weren’t physically with us.”\nHer brothers said they “miss your appetite for life – you loved to order a bunch of different dishes and taste everything, you loved to party and also go to sleep early after a day of giving it your all.

I’ll never forget the moment I entered the restaurant and saw her, and life just stopped, for five minutes I couldn’t take my gaze off her,” he wrote. “And since then, for four years, the only thing I wanted was to see her smile.”\nFor the past four years, he wrote, “Ziv made sure to show me how good the world is through her perspective, how important it is to be with family and to check up on them, how important it is to listen to others no matter who they are, and how important it is to know how to forgive because everyone deserves a second chance.”\nHer family said they were struggling to come to terms with her brutal murder so close to home.\n“Ziv was a talented girl, a champion who achieved every goal she set for herself in the best way,” her mother, Daniel, told a local news outlet, noting that she received an award for excellence while serving in the police during her mandatory IDF service. “She was an athlete and hardworking. Over the past year she took life by storm, during her travels she did every extreme [sport] she could, bungee jumping, climbing a volcano, the Carnivale and parties.”\n“Ziv traveled around the world and came home safe,” her mother added. “And here, in our home in the Land of Israel, she was brutally murdered. It hurts and I can’t come to terms with it.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

The bus station also served as a bomb shelter which was supposed to electronically unlock when there were rocket sirens in the city. As they were standing outside, a rocket siren sounded in the city but the door malfunctioned, and the group of travelers were stuck outside.\nMoments later, a pickup truck of Hamas terrorists drove by and opened fire on the group, killing all 13 passengers. Photos of the slain senior citizens strewn on the ground were among the first to circulate in Israel and around the world of the Hamas atrocities that day. Photos also later circulated just moments before of the group standing outside the shelter, a final snapshot before every one of them was murdered.\nShe was killed alongside fellow passengers Natalia Tomayev, Lilia Giller, Yaakov Mortov, Tatiana Schnitman, Igor Kurtser, Valeri Fridman, Michal Zarbailov, Nadejda Spravchikov, Sonia and Vladimir Popov, Berta Shamayev and Zina Beylin.\nLuda was buried in Ofakim.

She always acted like everything was fine, even when it wasn’t, and she was willing to do anything for me, just to put a smile on my face.”\n“She was my role model, she was everything to me,” she added. “Every time my mother went to work, she would stay with me and play with me, and every time I was sick she would take care of me and give me her whole soul. Savta had no holds barred when it came to me, and she would do anything to put a smile on my face.”\nEva said her grandmother “was shy, with the biggest heart. Savta always took care of everyone except herself and put her family in first place. Her smile was captivating and mesmerized everyone.

Yuval Bar founded a collective recycling program on the kibbutz. Maayan Bar was responsible for kibbutz job placements.\nTheir daughter Noya Bar shared a harrowing picture from the home’s safe room, which was destroyed and burned, and where the family “once felt safe,” she said.\n“Watch over us from above. We miss you and we’ll miss you forever,” their son, Itay Bar, wrote on Facebook on October 18, adding that their deaths left a “huge hole in our hearts.”\n“I’m sure you were together until the last second… the best parents and grandparents,” he wrote.\nIn his eulogy, which he shared to Facebook, Itay Bar described a tight-knit family, with loving parents and grandparents who were actively involved in their children’s lives and careers, and who offered a warm upbringing and a music- and story-filled home.\n“You and your home were for me a kingdom of freedom, love and contentment. Visiting you at the kibbutz after all the craziness of my life outside of it was, for me, like sitting on a rainbow,” wrote Bar. He recounted long nights of working as a deejay or out with friends, crashing at his parents’ home, and waking up to his mother’s singing and hearing his father puttering around the house waiting for him to emerge from his childhood bedroom to talk.\nIt was “a house of freedom and chaos, talking, shouting, jumping from conversation to conversation and topic to topic within seconds. I miss it so much.”\nHe joked about his father quickly falling asleep in the armchair for Thursday night basketball games on TV and abruptly waking to cheer when he heard his son, before falling asleep again 30 seconds later.\n“There were times I woke him up on purpose and got excited even when I didn’t need to be, just to see him like that again.”\n“They took my amazing father and mother from me and my sisters, they took from my nephews the grandparents they loved so much, they took from my grandmother her oldest and dearest son, they took from my uncles such a good brother and sister. Wherever I look I will notice who they took you from, because that’s who you were. A huge light and an open and giving heart to everyone. For me, you were my most basic and natural security and home in this world,” he wrote.\n“People, or rather monsters, full of darkness, evil and war cut short the lives of my parents full of light, love and peace.

At 7:45 a.m. his wife called him and he said, “I’m busy, I’ll get back to you,” and hung up.

Yam Goldstein-Almog, 20, were murdered by Hamas terrorists in their home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7.\nThe family’s mother, Chen, and their three younger children, Agam, 17, Gal, 11 and Tal, 9, were all kidnapped and taken to Gaza by Hamas. On November 26, they were released from Gaza and returned to Israel.\nWhen the rest of the family returned home, their relatives found out that Chen had seen Nadav and Yam killed before she and the other kids were taken captive. They were relieved, in a sense, to not have to be the ones to break the news.\nVarda Goldstein, Nadav’s mother and Yam’s grandmother, said after the rest of the family’s return that “it’s so exciting to see the kids, to touch them, to see that they’re in good shape and they look good and are smiling. But on the other hand, we need to have an emotional balance with the fact that there are also family members who were murdered.”\nIn addition to his wife and three of his children, Nadav is also survived by his sisters, Inbar and Naama, and his parents, Varda and David Goldstein.\nThe family didn’t want to bury Nadav and Yam — who were identified several days after the massacre — until they knew what had happened to Chen, Agam, Gal and Tal. It took another 10 days before the family discovered Chen and her three children were officially considered hostages in Gaza, according to army intelligence.\nOn October 23, they buried Nadav and Yam in Kibbutz Shefayim, where most Kfar Aza residents were evacuated. The funeral was held, with cruel irony, on Chen’s birthday.\nSix members of the Goldstein-Almog family from Kibbutz Kfar Aza.

(Courtesy)\nChen and Nadav were high school sweethearts who met when they were 14, married young and made their home in Kfar Aza, a place they never thought about leaving, no matter what was happening in the Gaza border community.\n“My brother-in-law always said, ‘You don’t leave your home,’” said Omri Almog, Chen’s sister. He recalled that when visiting his brother-in-law in intensive care over the summer after a riding accident, Nadav told him, “Hope dies last.”\nNadav was remembered by family and friends as a dedicated athlete, who competed in triathlons, and was delivered a recent setback following his accident. By day he was the vice president of business development at Kafrit Industries, Kfar Aza’s publicly traded plastic manufacturing company.\nFamily said that Nadav was likely hobbled by his accident on the day of the attack, and that Yam tried desperately to reach out for help, texting the army, the police and anyone she could reach trying to get help before she was murdered.\nYam was recalled as devoted to her military service, where she worked as acommander in the Computer Service Directorate. In the end, her body was identified by her butterfly tattoo, said family.\nNadav’s sister, Inbar Goldstein, told the Kan public broadcaster that her oldest brother was “talented, smart and beautiful… he was a role model – the best I could have had.”\nAt their funeral, Inbar recalled Yam as someone who “if anybody needed help, she was the first to be there.”\nVarda, Nadav’s mother, shared on Facebook the eulogy she wrote for her son and granddaughter.\n“My beloved family, my beautiful son, my gorgeous granddaughter, you are my glorious heroes,” she wrote. “Nadav and Yam, beautiful as the glow of the heavens, bereft of all evil. Their voices fell silent.

He is survived by his wife, Adar, their four children, Eshhar, Arbel, Ido and Omer, his parents Rafi and Edna and his sisters Tzipi, Hamutal and Anat. He was predeceased by another sister, Sivan.\nAt the time of his death, Ben Basat was the most senior IDF officer to have been killed in the ground offensive against Hamas.\nAt his funeral, his wife Adar said she had found it impossible to pen his eulogy: “All night I tried to write, I couldn’t get to it and my heart is dying over saying goodbye,” she said. “This morning I woke up and we cried, the kids and I. Five broken hearts that love you and are connected to you.”\n“Over the past few years you invested so much in your relationship with each one of them,” Adar added. “You built a true and moving connection.

I was sure that you had special protection. There are many things I want to say about you, you are my child, unique and special. You devoted your life to protecting the land… you were a leader and an initiator. Golani was  your home. You served always on the edge, and when you decided in the summer to complete your service, we were so happy that you made it out healthy and whole.”\nThe head of the IDF Personnel Directorate Maj. Gen. Yaniv Asor recalled that Ben Basat was at home on vacation ahead of his slated retirement from the IDF when the October 7 massacre happened. He raced to the front lines, jumped into a jeep to help rescue residents under fire near the Gaza border, and decided to remain in the military once the war broke out.\n“From the moment you fell, I started running through our first meeting in my head. A short meeting was enough for us, you stood out with quiet leadership, strived for contact, set norms, and joined the group that every battalion commander dreamed of,” he said. “Together we grew, and I learned a chapter in responsible leadership from you.

They were predeceased in 2019 by Eyal, Tova’s husband and Aran’s father, following a long illness.\nAran and Tova were buried side by side in Kibbutz Shefayim on October 22.\nTova was a longtime teacher who had retired just weeks before her death, but still ran her own catering business. She and Eyal originally settled in the Dugit settlement in northern Gaza, and moved to Kibbutz Nahal Oz following the 2005 disengagement. Following the move, they started a catering business in place of the restaurant they had ran in Dugit, which Tova continued after his death — which is also when she moved to Kfar Aza. Aran had come to visit her mother especially to help her out with a catering gig that weekend.\nAran, who was living in Givatayim, was a prolific social activist who worked for the past two years for the nonprofit Comeback, which worked to rehabilitate ex-prisoners. She had a bachelor’s degree in communications from Sapir College in Sderot, before making a career switch and getting a master’s degree at Hebrew University in Jerusalem’s “Glocal” program in international development, which included five months working in Nepal with underprivileged communities.\nIdo Goren wrote on Facebook to his sister a week after she was killed: “Arani, we went from loving siblings to enemies to friends and back to siblings. We are so alike that it caused conflict, we were and remain two stubborn people.”\n“We always challenged each other, and most of the time we were an inseparable force. You were the backbone everywhere you went, with your friends, in the army, in every workplace, studies and all your trips. It was known that Aran Goren lives the life, does what she wants, and succeeds, knows how to achieve. You were like the flow of water which erodes a rock with steadfast force, never giving up and never compromising.”\nIdo continued: “I will try to be closer to who you thought I should be, to what you knew I could do. I love you forever. I’m prepared to say that we are similar, ready to admit that I was wrong. But unlike the other things I may have denied, this I am ready to say again and again — I love you.”\nWriting to his mother, Tova, Ido said that she always felt “like an anchor to the world when I was sinking into my anxieties. We were connected in a way that people didn’t understand… You were always there to give me strength when I fell.” He described her as a “career woman, who carried an entire family on her back. Who worked around the clock. Who didn’t sleep at night until the last moment, because taking care of her family was so important to her.\n“She was always giving, always listening, always half angry but completely understanding,” he added. “You were our pride and an inspiration to thousands. I was so happy for you when you retired, I so much wanted you to start to enjoy and to let go of the burden… I have so much to say about you because I can no longer speak to you, my best friend, who I could never keep anything from.”\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Aran Goren (@aranush)\nNoa shared online the eulogy she read at the joint funeral of her mother and sister.\n“You were both so beautiful. All that was truly good in the world. Endless generosity. Nonstop activity. Dedication to the needs of others. A true desire for justice. Wisdom expressed in razor-sharp words. Heaps of humor, the darkest of humor — how dark it is now,” said Noa.\n“Your light is so missing. An insane reality in which I don’t have a father, I don’t have a mother and I don’t have a sister,” she continued. “And I am so alone and so together at the same time. Together in pain with all the people whose lives you were in, who were privileged to absorb your light.”\nAran, she said, was a “girl of freedom with big eyes, a girl who fell asleep everywhere because the whole world was her home, a social justice warrior and a defender of the weak, a pusher of boundaries, my keeper of secrets, my partner in life, the most hysterically funny person I know, but also the calmest… You are magic, you are light, you are love and you are freedom. You are smart and strong and brave with no ability to plan financially,” she joked. “In my heart, there is a hole in the shape of you.”\nTurning to her mother, Noa noted, “How very much I need my mother right now. It’s so hard to find the words to say about you. You knew almost everything about me. You were mostly the first person I called when I needed help, support, calming down, proportionality or just to say out loud what I was thinking.”\n“You kept working as if we were all still living in the house and you were providing for 10 people and at the same time you kept friendships and leisure and plenty of time for your grandchildren,” she said. “Our hearts are bound together in a bond that can’t be untied.”\nParting from both of them, Noa added: “The loves of my life, the smart, the beautiful.

A number of soldiers were killed in the ensuing gunfire, including Benyamin and several of his comrades.\nHis sister, Oshrat, told a local news site that he called her early that morning and told her of the Hamas infiltration into the base, “and that they were entering the bomb shelter, where he was with his friend.

That’s the story we should have been able to tell to every one of the five children we wanted.”\nOne, she added, “I asked you what your biggest dream was, and you answered that it was to take care of your parents.

Nine of them headed to Kibbutz Kfar Aza, which was overrun with Hamas gunmen.\nTal — known to his friends as “TalCo” — and three others, Cpt. Hadar Kama, Maj. Ilay Zisser and Cpt.

My soul-searching as a person, as a warrior, as a commander. How much have I really fulfilled my duty, my responsibility, how dedicated I am to the task and to the people… Those who have fought, those who have lost friends in battle, those who have led commandos in riots and risked their lives — they know that the commander is obligated to his men to bring them home safely.”\nOn such a day, he wrote, “When I see those who are no longer here, the question always arises: Could things have been different?”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

She was buried on October 12 in Beit Dagan.\nAccording to a eulogy on the Holon municipal website, Shani studied music in high school and was a “talented singer” as well as a designer and seamstress.\nShani worked as a waitress at the 2C restaurant in Tel Aviv and also performed around the country with the “Pupik” entertainment troupe. She loved to travel and had saved Instagram highlights from all of her recent trips abroad — NYC, Greece, Sinai, London and Barcelona.\nShe had a particular love of Purim, always designing and sewing her own costumes. Ahead of this year’s celebration, her friend Daniella Aperlev spoke to Army Radio about the initiative in her memory to collect and donate Purim costumes to those in need.\n“Shani and I have been friends since age 12,” Aperlev told the radio station. “We were five friends, we grew up together in Holon, and Shani was the most unique possible. She was a person whose life goal was to be happy, to make others happy, and to do good. I can’t perfectly describe her.”\nAperlev said Shani would sew costumes for all her friends each Purim and also sell them to others, “always doing hers last, right when we had to walk out the door because she wanted to make sure everyone else was happy and satisfied first.”\nShani’s sister, Ortal Ben Ami, wrote on Instagram that as a child “I waited nine years for you to arrive, and you did. The most beautiful present I ever received. But I didn’t know it was for such a limited time. Only for 27 years.”\nOrtal wrote that she, Shani and Nofar were always a “trio, everyone was jealous of our unique connection — something in the funny and stormy dynamic, something in our differences that just worked. Anything that happened to one of us we would immediately share with the others, our travels together, our parties. We always helped each other.”\nAnd now, she wrote, “You will no longer accompany me through the different stations of my life, and I won’t accompany you… I promise to do everything so that we can recover as a family and be happy and travel because that’s what you would have wanted. We will immortalize you so that everyone will know what a loss it was to the world.”\nOne thing gives me some comfort, wrote Ortal, “that in your final moments, you were surrounded by nature, by friends that you loved, and that you laughed until you cried.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

Amid the chaos the group ended splitting up, and Ziv was last seen hiding in the bushes between the parking lot and the nearby Kibbutz Re’im.\nZiv was considered missing for more than a week until his body was identified.\nHe was buried in Gevim on October 16. He is survived by his parents, Reut and Pesach, and his younger brother Guy.\nBorn and raised in Kibbutz Gevim, Ziv attended school in the nearby Sderot, according to a state eulogy.\nAfter finishing high school, he did a year of national service at a dormitory for at-risk youth who had previously been hospitalized or attended rehab. Ziv then enlisted in the IDF, serving in the Paratroopers Brigade’s reconnaissance unit.\nFollowing his release, Ziv worked for a year in the fishery at Kibbutz Ma’agan Michael in the north before taking off for 10 months of traveling around Asia. In recent years, Ziv was living in Yafo in south Tel Aviv and devoting his time to studying and perfecting his Arabic, specifically the Egyptian dialect, in which he became fluent.\nHe was slated to begin a degree in Mideast studies and international relations at Tel Aviv University just a few weeks after he was killed.\nHis friends said he had a keen sense of humor, loved sports, Hapoel Tel Aviv, dancing at music festivals and would always say that any new person he met was “first of all a king, unless proven otherwise.”\nZiv’s friend, Maya Baitner, wrote on Facebook that they met “through our shared love of the Arabic language.”\n“Ziv had an amazing vibe, he was the kind of person that always drew a lot of interest, love and smiles from everyone around,” she wrote. “Just two weeks ago, we sat on the beach in Jaffa, laughed, and talked about life… He had an exciting love and curiosity for the language, and such wide knowledge… He always knew how to find the word that I forgot how to say.”\nZiv’s younger brother, Guy, wrote on Instagram that “anything I say will minimize who you were.”\nHis brother, he said, “was always calm, always helping, always here. There are people who always know what to say, but you always knew what to do. They say people don’t remember what you said but what you made them feel — that’s you, my brother, you made everyone feel like they were the best, number one, that you’re with them until the end.”\nGuy wrote that he misses his “presence, the feeling that everything is good now, and if it’s not, then you’ll make us feel like it’s good… I want your optimism, I want your motivation, I want your calm, I want your smile, I want to know how to enjoy like you. I want to hear you say again, ‘What are you worried about, bro? You’ll figure it out.’ I want to love everyone the way you loved.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."}

Photo: JCTT\nThe footage shows three individuals dressed in hoodies and masks get out of the vehicle and use an axe to damage the entrance of the synagogue. At least two individuals commence pouring the contents of red jerry cans inside the entrance of the synagogue, before entering the building.\nThe individuals then make multiple trips to the Golf to get more jerry cans, which were poured inside the synagogue before the liquid was ignited.\nThe individuals fled the synagogue shortly after and drove away in the Golf towards the western suburbs.\nCCTV images of those believed responsible for the Adass Israel Synagogue arson attack. Photo: JCTT\nThe Golf is a stolen car that was also used in other offences before the synagogue arson, including the Lux nightclub arson in South Yarra in November 2024, and an arson and shooting that occurred in Bundoora on the same night as the synagogue arson attack.\nThe Golf, which had cloned number plates, was seized by police last year. The nightclub and shooting are being investigated by Victoria Police and are not considered politically-motivated attacks.\nAccording to The Herald Sun, on Thursday morning investigators made a wave of arrests and raids over the nightclub fire.\nThe pre-dawn raids resulted in the arrests of two men after three Pakenham properties were raided early on Thursday.\nTwo Pakenham men, aged 21 and 22, were arrested about 6am and will be interviewed by arson squad detectives today.\nAFP Assistant Commissioner Counter Terrorism and Special Investigations Command Stephen Nutt said the investigation into the synagogue arson attack remained a priority for the JCTT.\nInternal damage to the Adass Israel Synagogue after it was firebombed. Photo: Yumi Rosenbaum\n“Investigators have painstakingly poured over CCTV footage collected from more than 1400 locations to identify and track the actions of the alleged offenders,” Assistant Commissioner Nutt said.\n“We believe there are multiple offenders directly and indirectly linked to the synagogue arson, and our terrorism investigation into their actions continues.\n“I remind those involved that the penalty for terrorism is life imprisonment.\n“It is just a matter of time before police knock on your door. It is in your interest to come forward now.\n“This is no normal crime and that is why it is being investigated by the JCTT with the full force and capability of Victoria Police, the AFP and ASIO. Do not stay silent, come forward.\n“Based on the information we have, we suspect some of the individuals involved are extremely violent.\n“The JCTT is leaving no stone unturned in this investigation, and I want to thank the Jewish community for their patience and support.\n“We also thank the Victorian community for their assistance, through the provision of CCTV footage, and information provided.”\nVictoria Police Counter Terrorism Command Assistant Commissioner Tess Walsh said investigators have worked tirelessly over the past five months to progress the investigation.\n“This was an attack that impacted Victorians’ feeling of safety and left people feeling deeply shocked, saddened and rightly concerned.\n“Since the fire occurred, the investigation has been a significant priority for Victoria Police. This includes both our specialist JCTT investigators as well as experienced detectives working on a range of crime themes, such as our Arson and Explosives Squad investigators.\n“One of the key areas of focus for investigators has been to determine who has planned this attack and why, it is about more than just identifying those who went there on the night to light this fire.\n“Today has provided us with a breakthrough in the Lux nightclub arson investigation and we are now in a position to publicly confirm that we believe the vehicle used in that incident is the same as the synagogue fire, as well as many other incidents of significant criminality such as shootings and aggravated burglaries across Melbourne.\n“There is no doubt that this blue VW Golf sedan is key. We need assistance from the public as we attempt to identify those who have been using this vehicle and what they have been involved in, and we know there are people out there who can supply this information. Any small detail could be crucial.\n“Now is also the time for people to speak up if they have information about who was involved with this offending and what their motivation was. We have said many times before; it is only luck that stands between a fire that damages a property and a fire that kills dozens of people. Fire is absolutely uncontrollable, and the sheer recklessness of this offending cannot be tolerated.\n“I want to reassure Victorians, particularly those in the Jewish community, that we remain fully committed to finding those responsible for this act and holding them to account. I understand that it can be difficult when these matters take time, but again, make no mistake that this investigation remains a key priority for Victoria Police and the AFP and we are dedicated to bringing it to a successful conclusion as soon as possible.”\nAdass Israel community member Chayim Klein said, “We’re very grateful to Victoria Police. We have faith in them that they will continue the investigation and find the perpetrators”.\n“We’re very grateful for the tremendous work they’re putting in and the effort all the organisations are putting in towards it, and we’re very appreciative of the community support and support from the wider network”.\nKlein said the police have been in touch prior to anything happening and any information that they have, they’ve been sharing with the Adass community."}

She also remarked that while she remains a “steadfast friend” of Palestinians, she criticised their leaders for “letting them down” and for not being “interested in peace with Israel”.\n“It is not a party interested in a secure Israel behind secure borders, and it is not a party interested in a just and lasting peace,” Ley said.\nHer outspoken support for Israel since becoming deputy Liberal leader in 2022, contrasts with her earlier criticism of Israel in parliamentary speeches and when she was co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine.\nLey said her perspective changed following a series of developments – her visit to Israel in 2022 with Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council’s (AIJAC) Rambam program, “the hideous events of October 7”, the listing of Hamas as a terrorist organisation and the Abraham Accords.\nHer leadership has been welcomed by Australian Jewish leaders.\nAIJAC executive director Colin Rubenstein stated, “In recent years, Sussan has become a staunch friend of the Jewish community.” Adding, she has been “principled and informed in speaking out in support of Israel, especially during the current war with Hamas”.\nExecutive Council of Australian Jewry co-CEO Peter Wertheim praised Ley’s views on the conflict. “She is right when she says Israel currently has no partner for peace in Gaza,” he stated.\n“In the face of these realities Sussan Ley has rejected the reflexively antagonistic attitudes of Israel’s perennial critics. For this she deserves our respect.”\nZionist Federation of Australia president Jeremy Leibler congratulated Ley on her “historic appointment” and added, “We look forward to working closely with her and her team to advance the interests of the Australian Jewish community and work together to ensure the Australia-Israel connection remains strong.”\nLey won the liberal leadership on Tuesday defeating Angus Taylor with 29 votes to Taylor’s 25 votes. Her deputy will be Ted O’Brien, the former energy spokesperson.\nThe member for Farrer is Australia’s first female opposition leader and the most senior woman in Liberal party history. Ley is a former environment and health minister.\nThe 63-year-old is a trained pilot, mother of three and grandmother of six. She was born in Nigeria to British parents, grew up in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and moved to Australia when she was 13. Ley was elected to Parliament in 2001, and in 2011 travelled to the West Bank in a trip funded by the Palestinian Authority that was not declared.\nWhen Ley become deputy leader of the Liberal party in 2022 she said she supported the Liberal Party’s position on Israel, “We support the two-state solution. We support Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in peace, and we do not support the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state.”"}

In this election, she increased her primary vote by 3.2 per cent.\nFollowing her victory, Dr Ryan stated, “I’m grateful for the opportunity to continue to hold the government to account on the economy, climate, health, and the other critical issues for my community.”\nAustralian Jewish community leaders congratulated Ryan on her win. Executive Council of Australian Jewry president Daniel Aghion said, “We congratulate Dr Ryan on her re-election in Kooyong. At the recent pre-election community debate, she condemned antisemitism and spoke of the importance of a whole of community response to fighting racial hatred. She also supported Israel and Zionism and spoke of tackling the humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by Hamas. We look forward to continue working with Dr Ryan in the next term of Parliament.”\nAghion also praised Amelia Hamer for her efforts, noting, “We also commend Amelia Hamer for consulting with our community and running a competitive campaign which increased her party’s share of the vote, against the national trend.”\nZionist Federation of Australia president Jeremy Leibler added, “We congratulate Monique on her re-election, and look forward to engaging constructively with her on issues that matter to the Jewish community.”\nSpeaking to The AJN in April, Dr Ryan described rising antisemitism since October 7 as “awful” and “distressing” to witness, asserting “We have to push back against it as strongly as we can in all its forms.”\nWhile she has criticised aspects of Israel’s military conduct in Gaza calling for adherence to international law, she also believes that “Hamas has no place in Gaza”.\nRyan has also said that she supports and respects the ICC after it issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n“I think that we have to act in accordance with treaties to which we are a signatory,” adding “I don’t believe the government should intervene either way … the decision as to whether or not to arrest him would be up to the police forces.”\nShe has stated that her support for United Nations Relief Works Agency (UNRWA) in a letter co-signed by other teals last year was based on getting aid tho those who need it rather than backing the organisation itself. She welcomed the government’s recent funding for alternative aid providers like Project Rozana."}
