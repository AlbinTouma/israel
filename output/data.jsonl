The officials who spoke with The Times of Israel said that — contrary to Hamas’s claim — no direct talks were held between the terror group and the US.\nHamas in its statement also said that it was prepared to enter intensified negotiations aimed at reaching a final agreement to end the war, establish a mutually “agreed prisoner exchange, and enable Gaza to be administered by an independent professional authority.”\nHamas uses the term “prisoner exchange” to refer to the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian security prisoners, including terrorists convicted of murdering Israelis.\nPalestinian security inmates released by Israel as part of a hostage release-ceasefire deal with Hamas are welcomed by family members as they arrive on buses to the European hospital in Khan Younis on February 1, 2025.

The responsibility lies with the Israeli government,” it added. “Nobody can be left behind.”\nTerror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 59 hostages, including 58 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023. They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF.\nHamas released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals — and the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives during a ceasefire between January and March. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. In exchange, Israel has freed some 2,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners, and Gazan terror suspects detained during the war.\nEight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014.\nThe body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt. Hadar Goldin, is still being held by Hamas, and is counted among the 59 hostages.\nAgencies contributed to this report."}

We’re going to be successful in getting Edan home.”\nIt is comments like these that keep Yael Alexander in a constant state of adrenaline rush.\n“It’s like a rollercoaster,” she told The Times of Israel. “I feel like I’m on the edge of falling since October 7.

It’s abuse to humans to have hostages there. They have to think about the families and the hostages.”\nHer daughter, Yael, the third of her five children, happened to be in Israel on October 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked the Gaza border communities and towns. The Alexanders had planned to be in Israel about once a month while Edan was serving in the army.\nEdan had been home in the US for August 2023, and once the Jewish high holidays had passed, Yael Alexander traveled to Israel to spend part of Sukkot with Edan and the rest of her family, before he went back to his base for the end of the holiday.\nEdan Alexander was taken captive by Hamas terrorists on October 7, 2023. (Courtesy)\nShe spoke to him at 7 a.m. on October 7, soon after the Hamas attack began, and minutes before he was taken captive by Hamas terrorists. The rest of the Alexanders — Adi, Mika and Roy — flew to Israel to join her, and it was on October 12 that the family found out that Edan was taken hostage.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“When they arrived on October 9, I cried like a little girl,” she said. “I didn’t have answers because we didn’t know where Edan was. I still see that moment in my life, I had never cried like that. Maybe I’ll cry like that when I see Edan.”\nThe family has received several signs of life of Edan, from hostages who were freed in November 2023 and had met him, handcuffed in the tunnels. He told them he was an American-Israeli soldier, was hugged by one hostage and was given water to drink with the help of another hostage.\nIn November 2024, Alexander was seen again in a Hamas propaganda video, his face thin and wan, with dark circles under his eyes.\nEdan Alexander, 20, held hostage by Hamas, is seen in a propaganda video by the terror group that was released on November 30, 2024.

At the starting point, almost everyone was alive, and suddenly you get bad news, bad news, the worst news.”\nThe last week has brought its own set of painful challenges, as the bodies of Oded Lifshitz, Shiri Bibas, and the two little Bibas boys were brought back in coffins, followed by the release of another Hamas video, this one of two hostages, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal, forced by their captors to watch the release of Saturday’s captives.\n“It’s a sick, sick game,” said Alexander. “It’s the cruelest thing to see. We need to save them, and I hope Trump sees that video.”\nFor now, said Alexander, they are waiting for some decisions on phase two of the deal, hoping that her son is on the list.\nShe worries about the horrific conditions in the Gaza tunnels, knowing that Edan is most probably kept in a similar state as other hostages have been, in the thin air of the tunnels, without sunlight, in filth and torturous conditions.\n“Edan has to stay strong,” she said. “I want him to know that we’re coming nonstop to be here, near him, and we’ll be here when he’s released.”"}

Hamas stressed to the mediator that it was ready to work with the Trump administration to secure a permanent ceasefire in Gaza with security arrangements in order to ensure a yearslong calm until a final settlement of the conflict is reached, the sources said.\nUS special envoy to the Mideast Steve Witkoff speaks at an Israeli Embassy in Washington event marking Independence Day, May 5, 2025 (Israeli Embassy in Washington)\nHamas also told the US via the backchannel that it needed to locate Alexander. Last month, it released a propaganda video showing Alexander alive. Two days later, the group claimed it had lost contact with his captors after an Israeli airstrike.\nOn Sunday, Hamas told the mediator that it had found Alexander and was prepared to move ahead with his release. The negotiator, in turn told Hamas to inform Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani of the decision. The Qatari premier then called Witkoff to confirm that Alexander’s release would be moving ahead.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWitkoff then called Netanyahu and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to inform them of the development, the US official said. Israel then agreed to temporary halt some of its military operations, including drone surveillance of the Strip in the lead-up and during Alexander’s release on Monday, the source familiar with the matter said.\nAfter receiving the news from Witkoff, Alexander’s parents took off for Israel from the US on Sunday night and were accompanied by US hostage envoy Adam Boehler.\nNetanyahu’s office issued a statement early Monday morning claiming that Alexander’s release was made possible due to Israel’s military pressure in Gaza. It stressed that Israel did not agree to a ceasefire or to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Alexander — only to provide a safe corridor to allow for his release.\nIn an earlier statement attributed to an “Israeli official,” Netanyahu’s office said that it was still prepared to accept the so-called “Witkoff proposal” through which Hamas agrees to release half of the hostages up front in exchange for a weekslong truce during which the sides agree to hold talks on the terms of a permanent end to the war.\nRepublican US presidential nominee Donald Trump poses for photos with family members of Edan Alexander, a hostage held by Hamas, after visiting the gravesite of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, October 7, 2024, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)\nSuch talks were supposed to have been held during the previous agreement that the sides signed in January, but Netanyahu largely refused to engage in such negotiations, amid pressure from his far-right coalition partners who threatened to collapse his government if he agreed to end the war.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccordingly, Hamas has insisted on ironclad guarantees, such as a UN Security Council resolution, in order to ensure that Israel holds those talks and agrees to end the war.\nIn addition to releasing the hostages, Israel is demanding that Hamas dismantle its governing and military capabilities. While the group has said it is prepared to forgo control of the Strip to an independent committee of Palestinian technocrats, it has held off on the demand to permanently disarm."}

The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. In exchange, Israel has freed some 2,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners, and Gazan terror suspects detained during the war.\nEight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014.\nThe body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt.

At the starting point, almost everyone was alive, and suddenly you get bad news, bad news, the worst news.”\nThe last week has brought its own set of painful challenges, as the bodies of Oded Lifshitz, Shiri Bibas, and the two little Bibas boys were brought back in coffins, followed by the release of another Hamas video, this one of two hostages, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal, forced by their captors to watch the release of Saturday’s captives.\n“It’s a sick, sick game,” said Alexander. “It’s the cruelest thing to see. We need to save them, and I hope Trump sees that video.”\nFor now, said Alexander, they are waiting for some decisions on phase two of the deal, hoping that her son is on the list.\nShe worries about the horrific conditions in the Gaza tunnels, knowing that Edan is most probably kept in a similar state as other hostages have been, in the thin air of the tunnels, without sunlight, in filth and torturous conditions.\n“Edan has to stay strong,” she said. “I want him to know that we’re coming nonstop to be here, near him, and we’ll be here when he’s released.”"}

Last month, it released a propaganda video showing Alexander alive. Two days later, the group claimed it had lost contact with his captors after an Israeli airstrike.\nOn Sunday, Hamas told the mediator that it had found Alexander and was prepared to move ahead with his release. The negotiator, in turn told Hamas to inform Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani of the decision. The Qatari premier then called Witkoff to confirm that Alexander’s release would be moving ahead.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWitkoff then called Netanyahu and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to inform them of the development, the US official said. Israel then agreed to temporary halt some of its military operations, including drone surveillance of the Strip in the lead-up and during Alexander’s release on Monday, the source familiar with the matter said.\nAfter receiving the news from Witkoff, Alexander’s parents took off for Israel from the US on Sunday night and were accompanied by US hostage envoy Adam Boehler.\nNetanyahu’s office issued a statement early Monday morning claiming that Alexander’s release was made possible due to Israel’s military pressure in Gaza. It stressed that Israel did not agree to a ceasefire or to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Alexander — only to provide a safe corridor to allow for his release.\nIn an earlier statement attributed to an “Israeli official,” Netanyahu’s office said that it was still prepared to accept the so-called “Witkoff proposal” through which Hamas agrees to release half of the hostages up front in exchange for a weekslong truce during which the sides agree to hold talks on the terms of a permanent end to the war.\nRepublican US presidential nominee Donald Trump poses for photos with family members of Edan Alexander, a hostage held by Hamas, after visiting the gravesite of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, October 7, 2024, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)\nSuch talks were supposed to have been held during the previous agreement that the sides signed in January, but Netanyahu largely refused to engage in such negotiations, amid pressure from his far-right coalition partners who threatened to collapse his government if he agreed to end the war.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccordingly, Hamas has insisted on ironclad guarantees, such as a UN Security Council resolution, in order to ensure that Israel holds those talks and agrees to end the war.\nIn addition to releasing the hostages, Israel is demanding that Hamas dismantle its governing and military capabilities. While the group has said it is prepared to forgo control of the Strip to an independent committee of Palestinian technocrats, it has held off on the demand to permanently disarm."}

Even at the cost of human life.”\nEdan Alexander (left) with his family (from left to right): mother Yael, brother Roy, sister Mika, and father Adi. (Courtesy of Alexander family)\nTrump now understands that Netanyahu “is an obstacle to security and the release of the hostages,” Golan continued, asserting that occupying the Gaza Strip will only lead to more deaths and “economic devastation.”\nOpposition Leader Yair Lapid also criticized the government for allowing itself to be cut out of the loop, stating that it represented “a diplomatic failure with consequences that endanger the security and well-being of the entire State of Israel.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“This alliance is the greatest strategic asset that the State of Israel has,” but while the Trump administration praises the Netanyahu government publicly, the “Americans are fed up with Netanyahu,” Lapid asserted.\n“The Trump administration is operating today without coordination and without listening to Netanyahu. They have reached a ceasefire with the Houthis in Yemen behind his back, are conducting dangerous negotiations with the Iranians, are promoting a Saudi nuclear program, and are making a hostage deal only for their own citizens,” Lapid said. “There has never been anything like this.”\n“Trump is a pro-Israel president. He loves Israel, but he hates dragging his feet, and postponements and delays, and hesitation, and lies,” Lapid continued. “He wants a ceasefire in Gaza, he wants a big hostage deal, he wants regional agreements that will help the American economy. Netanyahu does not know how to give him that. Not with this government.”\nYisrael Beytenu chairman Avigdor Liberman sounded a similar note, telling reporters that, “unfortunately, [Alexander’s] return is not happening as a result of Israeli pressure or a decision, but as a result of direct contact between the US and Hamas.”\nOpposition leader and Yesh Atid party head MK Yair Lapid speaks at a faction meeting in the Knesset on May 12, 2025. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nIsrael has “reached an unprecedented low” in its relations with the United States, Liberman argued, bemoaning “the [US] ceasefire with the Houthis when the State of Israel is left out of the agreement, the US president’s visit to the region when he skips Israel, [and] the direct negotiations between the US and Iran.”\nLast week, Trump announced that the US would stop bombing Yemen’s Houthis, after the Iran-backed group agreed to stop interrupting important shipping lanes in the Middle East.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe announcement did not mention the ongoing Houthi attacks on Israel, and a spokesman for the Yemeni rebel group pledged that such strikes would continue. Israeli officials told Hebrew media outlets that Washington did not give Jerusalem advance notice of the announcement, and that Israel was surprised by it.\nTrump also reportedly quashed Israeli proposals for a series of joint strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, opting instead to try for a diplomatic solution to the problem of Tehran’s nuclear program.\nThe Trump administration has sent mixed messages regarding Iran, stating both that it wants Tehran’s nuclear program completely destroyed and also insisting that it is open to letting the Islamic Republic pursue civilian nuclear energy.\nAt the same time, Trump is heading to the Middle East on Monday on a multi-country tour in which the US president will skip Israel, but will stop in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, leading government critics to warn that Jerusalem is being left out of Washington’s regional diplomatic initiatives.\nUS President Donald Trump takes questions outside the West Wing of White House in Washington, DC, on May 8, 2025.

We must stop delaying and launch the decisive attack. To occupy the entire territory of the Gaza Strip, and to encourage the migration of Gazans to countries around the world.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nSmotrich and Ben Gvir’s comments however appeared at odds with recent statements by senior American officials.\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff arrives for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin (not in picture) in Moscow, Russia, April 25, 2025.

And so, I don’t think there’s much daylight between how they think and how we think from a foreign policy perspective.”\nChannel 12 reported Sunday that Witkoff recently told hostages’ families that he disagrees with Israel’s approach to the war in the Strip, and believes that Israel is pointlessly extending the war when reaching a new ceasefire and hostage release deal is the correct next step to take.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsrael is planning to launch a major military offensive against Hamas in Gaza if no hostage deal is reached with the terror group by the end of Trump’s visit to the region.\nChannel 12 cited the families as saying they had not heard this kind of criticism of Israeli government policy from Witkoff in the past.\nFormer US ambassador to Israel David Friedman, who served under the first Trump administration, also asserted in an X post, “There is NO RIFT between President Trump and PM Netanyahu. There are those in both the US and Israel who would like to see such a rift, and they are feeding false accounts to the media to achieve just that. But it’s all fake.”\nCurrent US Ambassador Mike Huckabee tried to quell the rumors of tensions in interviews with Israeli networks Saturday, asserting that the US president was not snubbing Israel by skipping the Jewish state during his upcoming visit.\nJerusalem is reportedly unhappy with the ongoing US-Iran talks, which are said to be developing into a largely similar framework to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, which was signed by then-US president Barack Obama and was panned at the time by Netanyahu as disastrous for Israel.\nUnder the terms being discussed, according to reports, Iran would limit stockpile size and centrifuge types, and dilute, export, or seal its 60 percent uranium stock under unprecedented International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) scrutiny, in exchange for substantial sanctions relief.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis approach has not aligned with Netanyahu’s longtime position, which is that Israel will not allow Iran to attain nuclear weapons and is opposed to any talks that don’t lead Iran to agree to a “Libya-style agreement,” under which Tehran’s entire nuclear program — both military and civilian — would be dismantled completely.\nIn addition, Israel had not been made aware in advance of a recent deal signed between the US and the Houthi rebels in Yemen regarding a cessation of US bombing if the Iran-backed rebels stop firing on US shipping, which notably left the door open for Houthi strikes on Israel to go unabated.\nSecurity forces at the site where a missile fired from Yemen hit an area of Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, on May 4, 2025.(Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)\nThat deal was announced by Trump two days after a Houthi missile impacted the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport, a few hundred yards from the main control tower, lightly injuring several people and prompting most foreign airlines to halt flights to Israel.\nIsrael’s Channel 13 reported Sunday evening that people in Netanyahu’s inner circle have expressed unusually harsh criticism toward the Trump administration in recent weeks.\n“There’s chaos in the Trump administration — the right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing,” said a senior figure close to the premier, according to the report.\n“It’s not even clear if this has anything to do with us.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\nEstablishing ties has become especially toxic for Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered on October 7, 2023, when the Palestinian terror group Hamas led a devastating invasion of southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 taken as hostages to Gaza.\nAs such, the issue, central to bilateral talks in Trump’s first term, has effectively been delinked from economic and other security matters between Washington and the kingdom, according to six other sources Reuters spoke with for this story, including two Saudi and two US officials. The people all asked to remain anonymous to speak about sensitive diplomatic conversations.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSaudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, needs the Gaza war to end and a credible path to a Palestinian state “before he re-engages with the issue of normalization,” said Dennis Ross, a former US negotiator.\nIn the meantime, Washington and Riyadh will focus Trump’s trip largely on the economic partnership and other regional matters, according to the six sources. Lucrative investments such as major deals in arms, mega-projects and artificial intelligence are in play, officials from both sides stressed.\nThe approach was cemented in diplomatic talks between Saudi and US officials ahead of the trip, the first formal state visit of Trump’s second term, they said.\nTrump’s stated aim is to secure a trillion-dollar investment in US companies, building on an initial commitment of $600 billion pledged by the crown prince.\nThe wealthy kingdom, the world’s top oil exporter, knows the ritual well: dazzle the guest, secure the favor. The goal, the sources told Reuters, is to evade diplomatic landmines and perhaps, one said, to win concessions from Trump on the Gaza war and its aftermath.\nUS President Donald Trump, left, shakes hands with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he leaves the West Wing of the White House, April 7, 2025, in Washington.

That means lots of splashy deal announcements and collaborations that can be sold as being good for America,” said Robert Mogielnicki, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute, a think tank in Washington.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Normalizing ties with Israel is a much heavier lift than rolling out the red carpet for President Trump and announcing investment deals,” he said.\nA State Department spokesperson declined to comment on any understanding reached ahead of the trip, saying Trump “will look to strengthen ties between the United States and our Arab Gulf partners during the visits.”\nThe Saudi government communications office did not reply to a request for comment.\nCourt the kingdom\nBefore Hamas launched its October 7 attacks on Israel, the crown prince was finalizing a landmark diplomatic agreement: a US defense pact in exchange for Riyadh recognizing Israel.\nBut the scale of Israel’s campaign to destroy Hamas, topple its Gaza regime, and free the hostages forced a pause in the talks.\nThe Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 50,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though the toll cannot be verified and does not differentiate between civilians and fighters.\nIsrael says it has killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.\nIn November last year, bin Salman accused Israel of genocide.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraeli troops operate in Gaza in a photo published by the IDF on May 9, 2025. (Israel Defense Forces)\nFrustrated by the impact of Gaza’s prolonged crisis on normalization efforts, Trump could use his visit to unveil a US framework to end the 18-month war, the two Gulf sources said.\nThe plan could create a transitional government and new security arrangements for postwar Gaza, potentially reshaping regional diplomacy and opening the door to future normalization talks, they said.\nUnderscoring the high-stakes diplomacy underway, Trump met privately with Israel’s Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer on Thursday to discuss the war and nuclear talks with Iran, Axios reported.\nThe US State Department did not immediately respond to questions about Trump’s discussions on Gaza.\nTrump conspicuously has not announced a visit to Israel as part of his tour of the region. Two diplomats noted the US president has recently refrained from talking about his “Gaza Riviera” plan, which enraged the Arab world with the suggestion of resettling the entire Gazan population and US ownership of the strip.\nIn the build-up to the trip, Washington has taken a number of actions that are positive for Saudi Arabia. An agreement to stop US bombing of the Houthis in Yemen is in line with a Saudi ceasefire there. Washington has also delinked civil nuclear talks from the normalization question.\nThe stalled Saudi-US defense pact, initially conceived as a formal treaty, was revived in the scaled-back form of security guarantees late in the Biden presidency to bypass congressional opposition.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Trump administration has now picked up those talks, along with the discussions about a civilian nuclear agreement, three of the sources said, while cautioning that it will take time to define terms.\nChina influence\nTrump’s Saudi trip is his first formal state visit and second foreign trip since his re-election, after attending the pope’s funeral in Rome.

Since the launch of Vision 2030, China has become integral to the kingdom’s plans, dominating sectors from energy and infrastructure to renewables."}

The Israeli government was also widely panned for being sidelined in the talks to secure Alexander’s release.\nThe US and Hamas both confirmed late Sunday that the terror group would release Alexander in what was described as a goodwill gesture to US President Donald Trump ahead of his visit to the region this week.\nIsrael, which sources said was not involved in talks for the release, claimed Monday the development was the result of its military pressure on Hamas, while opposition lawmakers and families of hostages panned the government for not having been a party to talks, for not pursuing a broad deal to bring all of the remaining hostages home, and for allowing negotiations to take place that apparently favored hostages with dual citizenship.\n00:00 / 23:33\nAlexander, a dual citizen who grew up in New Jersey, was serving in the Israel Defense Forces at the time of his abduction.

Ohel’s mother Idit has been particularly vocal against what she terms a form of selection between hostages during previous rounds of releases.\nAccording to the family, relying on information from freed hostages, Ohel has been kept bound in chains and received no medical attention for shrapnel in his eye and shoulder from wounds suffered on October 7, 2023.\n“With a broken heart,” the family’s statement offered good wishes to the Alexander family on their son’s impending freedom and urged Israel’s government to reach a deal securing the release of the rest of the hostages.\n“Alon and the rest of the injured hostages are being left behind in the tunnels with no medical attention or help,” the family said. “There is no date for the end of our nightmare.”\nEinav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, attends a conference at Tel Aviv University, May 7, 2025.

If Matan is left alone in the tunnel, Netanyahu is deciding to murder my boy; instead of releasing all of the hostages, he has become my private angel of death.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nZangauker, whose combative criticism of the government has made her a prominent activist on behalf of the hostages, vowed to “hunt down the prime minister” for the suffering caused to her son.\nThe family of Itay Chen, a dual US-Israeli citizen whose body is held in Gaza, said in a statement, “These are moments of mixed feelings. We rejoice in the joy of Yael and Adi Alexander, who will soon get to hug their son. Every hostage that comes home warms the hearts of the families of hostages. On the other hand, our hearts cannot bear the deep grief. It is possible, and necessary, to bring everyone back.”\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the main group representing hostage families, said in a statement Sunday that the release of Alexander “must be the start of a single agreement that will return all 59 [remaining] hostages.”\n“There is only one moral, proper, and necessary agreement: the immediate return of all the hostages and the end of the war,” said the forum, which has long been calling for the government to agree to a deal that will return all the remaining hostages at once, rather than in phases.\n“Now is the time to bring about a breakthrough in negotiations. The responsibility lies with the Israeli government,” it added. “Nobody can be left behind.”\nOn Monday, the forum announced a rally to be held at noon in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv in anticipation of Alexander’s release.\nVarda Ben Baruch holds a picture of her grandson Edan Alexander, who is held hostage in Gaza, as she gathers with other families to call out on loudspeakers in hopes that their loved ones will hear them, near the Gaza border in Kibbutz Nir Oz, southern Israel, April 20, 2025.

They have no time.”\nHe further said that reports of direct contact between the US and Hamas to reach the agreement “are a disgraceful failure of diplomacy by the Israeli government and the person who heads it. The hostages are ours, and the responsibility to return them is of the government.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nOpposition MK Benny Gantz, leader of the National Unity Party, posted that “the heart swells at the apparent return of Edan — the stomach turns to see how the Israeli government is absent from every initiative to take responsibility.”\n“The time has come for the prime minister to exercise that responsibility,” he wrote.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel has committed to facilitating a safe corridor for the return of Alexander.\nIn a statement, the Prime Minister’s Office said Jerusalem has, however, made no further promise for a ceasefire or for the release of Palestinian security prisoners, who have been exchanged for hostages in previous deals.\n“The expected release of IDF soldier Edan Alexander [by Hamas] without getting anything in return, will be possible thanks to the determined policy we led, with the backing of [US] President [Donald] Trump, and thanks to IDF troops’ military pressure in the Gaza Strip,” the PMO said.\n“We are in critical days in which Hamas is facing a deal that would enable our hostages’ release,” it added. “Negotiations will continue under fire and amidst preparations for the intensification of the fighting.”\nThen-Republican US presidential nominee Donald Trump poses for photos with the family of Edan Alexander at Ohel Chabad Lubavitch on October 7, 2024, in New York City.

We will continue to do everything to return all of our hostages.”\nThe official said Israel will facilitate a safe corridor to get Alexander out of Gaza — presumably meaning halting fighting and reconnaissance flights in certain areas — but stressed that there is no ceasefire and that Hamas isn’t getting anything in return for the release. If Hamas agrees to an Israel-accepted proposal for a wider hostage deal, the expansion of the war will be postponed, the official added.\n(From R-L) US hostage envoy Adam Boehler, Yael Alexander, Shira Boehler and Boehler’s chief of staff Raechel Greenberg on a plane from the US to Israel on May 11, 2025.

The Hamas attack also killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians.\nHamas released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals — and the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives during a ceasefire between January and March. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. In exchange, Israel has freed some 2,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners, and Gazan terror suspects detained during the war.\nEight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014.\nThe body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt. Hadar Goldin, is still being held by Hamas, and is counted among the 59 hostages."}

There are 59 pure souls who fit that definition, and each and every one of them must come home now. Bring back the hostages, end the war.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nHerut Nimrodi, the mother of captive IDF soldier Tamir Nimrodi, speaks at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, on May 10, 2025.

Every day is filled with anxiety. Every day is a struggle. Every day is an attempt to cling to a ‘maybe.’\n“All of us, all the families, are in such a heightened state of alert that every word, every sentence spoken in the media or in private conversations about our loved ones, jolts us out of our artificial calm. It makes it even harder for us to function in this already insane reality,” she said.\nOther speakers at the Hostages Square rally highlighted opinion polls indicating that some 70 percent of the public supports an end to the fighting in Gaza as part of a deal to bring back the hostages.\nThe comments came after Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich — who opposes a truce-hostage deal and who has consistently failed to cross the electoral threshold in recent surveys — reportedly told hostage families that he represents the majority of the public.\nIlan Dalal, whose son Guy Gilboa-Dalal is among the living captives, cited the reported 70% support, saying: “According to every poll, the nation has already chosen. It’s chosen the hostages.”\nAt a separate rally in Habima Square in Tel Aviv, known for drawing more government-critical crowds, Rafi Ben Shitrit, the father of Staff Sgt. Shimon Alroy Ben Shitrit, who was killed during the attack on an IDF base on October 7, lashed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for saying this week that he “sleep[s] with a clear conscience.”\n“This week, I heard the most failed of Israel’s leaders say that he sleeps with a clear conscience. A leader under whose tenure the greatest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust occurred. He sleeps with a clear conscience. We are nearly 2,000 families whose tears have run out — and we can’t get a wink of sleep,” said Shitrit.\nRafi Ben Shitrit, whose son was killed on October 7, speaks at the Bereaved Families Memorial Ceremony marking one year since the killings, Oct. 7, 2024 (Bereaved Families Memorial Ceremony)\n“The man who financed Hamas, and whose office staff are paid by the same state that funneled billions to Hamas — sleeps with a clear conscience,” he said, referring to allegations under investigation that aides to the premier were paid by Qatar to lobby for the Hamas-supporting nation. “What more is there to say that hasn’t already been said? Indeed, we are left mute, without a voice.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nAt the same protest, Shai Mozes, whose parents Margalit and Gadi Mozes were kidnapped in the Hamas onslaught and later released in separate hostage deals, was more belligerent, saying that Israel’s “real enemy is not Hamas, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is destroying Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.”\nThe Habima rally was smaller than usual, drawing a few hundred people. The crowd was dotted with Israeli flags, and chants including, “The entire nation knows that Bibi is a crook” — using the premier’s nickname.\nThe protest started with a moment of silence for five IDF soldiers killed fighting in Gaza this week.\nYael Adar, the mother of slain captive Tamir Adar, addresses protesters on Begin Road, in Tel Aviv, on May 10, 2025. (Vardit Alon-Korpel/Pro-Democracy Protest Movement)\nAt another anti-government protest on Tel Aviv’s Begin Road, Yael Adar, whose son Tamir was snatched to Gaza after he was killed defending Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas onslaught, said the government was “sending our children to die in the name of lust for power.”\nShe slammed Netanyahu for failing to bring back the remains of her son, who was part of Nir Oz’s civilian defense squad, which fought for hours before the IDF arrived.\n“How is it that the person who went out first became transparent?” she asked. “How is it that someone who fought for the country is not being fought for by the country?”\nAdar urged Netanyahu to follow in the footsteps of Menachem Begin, who also served in the premiership while heading up the Likud party, and to resign immediately. Begin quit in 1983 amid the IDF’s rising death toll in the First Lebanon War, which he had launched the previous year.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“It’s called taking responsibility,” said Adar.\nAfter her speech and as the 1,500-odd crowd melted away, some 100 activists, many of them bearing torches, lit a bonfire on the road in front of the entrance to the IDF headquarters. They chanted: “Enough of the killing and grief, the hostages are above everything.”\nAt a protest in Kibbutz Nir Oz by the Gaza border, Silvia Cunio, mother of hostages David and Ariel Cunio, said: “There’s enough time to fight Hamas. There will be more operations and more conflicts. But Ariel and David’s lives — we won’t be able to get back if we wait too long. I don’t have the privilege to wait. And they can’t wait anymore.”\nAddressing the government, she asked: “Where are you? Where is the state? Where is the humanity? How do you sleep at night when my children and the other hostages, are buried alive underground?”\nAt the Habima protest, Media personality Linoy Bar Geffen, who often emcees the rallies, said the demonstration called for an end to the fighting in Gaza, the return of the remaining 59 hostages in a single deal, a state commission of inquiry into the disaster of October 7, an end to the governmemt’s judicial overhaul, and new elections.\n“What are you afraid of?” she asked members of Netanyahu’s coalition.\nDemonstrators protest against the government and for the release of people held hostage in the Gaza Strip outside IDF Headquarters in Tel Aviv, May 10, 2025 (Tomer Neuberg/Flash90)\n‘A country that’s worthy of living for’\nShirel Hogeg, a Sderot resident who survived the Hamas onslaught and rose to prominence after her anti-Netanyahu diatribe went viral, said the demonstration’s purpose was to make Israel “a country that’s worthy of living for, not just dying for.”\nAlso addressing the crowd, Gal Elkalay, a social activist who has served hundreds of days in the reserves since the start of the war, slammed the government’s decision to call up tens of thousands of reservists for yet another Gaza offensive, in a war she said had become futile.\n“Not the hostages, not dismantling Hamas — this war is a war to protect the coalition,” she said. “There is no more Israel Defense Force, only a Coalition Defense Force.”\n“This is not leadership, this is a criminal organization that glorifies death,” she said. “Why are we going back to war?”\nResponding to calls from the audience for soldiers to refuse to serve, she said, “We will not refuse,” but she urged members of the audience to take sick days from work and effectively shut down the economy until the government gets the message.\nDemonstrators protest against the government and for the release of people held hostage in the Gaza Strip outside IDF Headquarters in Tel Aviv, May 10, 2025 (Tomer Neuberg/Flash90)\nMeanwhile, as they have done every Saturday for several weeks, about 200 left-wing activists stood in silence on Tel Aviv’s Kaplan Street, outside IDF Headquarters’ southern entrance, holding candles and pictures of children killed by the IDF in Gaza since Israel renewed hostilities there on March 18.\nEach picture states the child’s name, as well as the date and place of their death.\nActivists hold up candles and pictures of slain Gazan children, outside the Kaplan Street entrance to the IDF headquarters, Tel Aviv, May 10, 2025.

What Israel has referred to as the “Witkoff proposal” — which sources told The Times of Israel at the time is in fact more of an Israeli offer — provides for the release of around half of the living hostages in return for an extended truce, followed by the release of the rest of the hostages alongside an end to the war.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe network said Witkoff was holding conversations with various key players Sunday night, trying to establish some kind of framework for a deal this week.\nWalla news reported that Witkoff was currently holding talks with Hamas, Qatar, Egypt and Israel on a hostage deal and longer-term calm.\nVarda Ben Baruch, grandmother of Edan Alexander, holds a picture of her grandson near the border with the Gaza Strip on April 20, 2025.

He has been held in Gaza for over 580 days.\nThe Hamas statement, issued ahead of Trump’s trip to the region this week, was meant as a goodwill gesture in the hope that Washington will coax Israel to end the war in Gaza, a source involved in the mediation effort told The Times of Israel.\nThe source said Hamas has received assurances from the US through mediators that Alexander’s release “would go a long way” with Trump, who wants to see the remaining hostages released and for the war in Gaza to end.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt was unclear when Alexander would be released, but a source involved in the process told The Times of Israel that the goal was for him to be released early this week, potentially as early as Monday.\nAccording to a source familiar with the negotiations, the US did not brief Israel on the effort to release Alexander until after the deal with Hamas was reached, saying Israel had generally been aware that efforts were ongoing, but only knew about them from its own intelligence operations.\nA demonstrator holds a sign showing the face of American-Israeli Edan Alexander (C), held hostage by the Hamas terror group, during a protest calling for a hostage deal in Tel Aviv on March 15, 2025.

Israel says it has killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7.\nIsrael has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.\nA United Nations vehicle is parked next to the rubble of a destroyed building in Gaza City, on May 12, 2025.

Tens of thousands are believed to have died in Somalia and South Sudan.\nIt rates an area as in famine when at least two of three things occur: 20 percent of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving; at least 30% of children six months to five years suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they’re too thin for their height; and at least two people or four children under five per every 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.\nThe report found that the first threshold was met in Gaza, saying 477,000 people — or 22% of the population — are classified as in “catastrophic” hunger for the period from May 11 to the end of September, and another million area at “emergency” levels, meaning they face very large gaps in food and high levels of acute malnutrition.\nThe malnutrition and death thresholds were not met. The data was gathered in April and up to May 6. Food security experts say it takes time for people to start dying from starvation.\nThe report warned of “imminent” famine in northern Gaza in March 2024, but the following month, Israel allowed an influx of aid under US pressure after an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers.\nMalnutrition is rising\nAid groups now say the situation is the most dire of the entire war. The UN humanitarian office, known as OCHA, said on Friday that the number of children seeking treatment at clinics for malnutrition has doubled since February, even as supplies to treat them are quickly running out.\nAid groups have shut down food distribution due to a lack of stocks.

We are open to this approach, and I will be discussing it with the United Nations — especially with Secretary-General [Antonio] Guterres — this Tuesday in Berlin,” said Wadephul.\nAhead of his visit, Wadephul called for “serious discussions for a ceasefire” in Gaza, where he said the humanitarian situation “is now unbearable.”\nWadephul said it was “imperative” to start talks to “free all hostages and to ensure that supplies reach the population of Gaza,” according to comments reported by his ministry.\nGaza’s residents are facing a growing humanitarian crisis, with Israel enforcing a two-month blockade on aid supplies to the small Palestinian enclave following the collapse of the most recent ceasefire.\nA local volunteer of the World Central Kitchen cooks meals to be distributed to needy Palestinians in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on May 3, 2024, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Hamas terror gropu. (AFP)\nIsrael has said that the Hamas terror group stole much of the aid entering the territory throughout the war, using it to supply its members and maintain control over the population, and therefore Israel won’t allow aid in until it puts in place a system giving it control over the distribution. Jerusalem also justifies the aid blockade as a necessary tool to pressure Hamas to release the 59 hostages terrorists are holding in the Strip.\nTalks between Hamas and the US administration regarding a ceasefire in Gaza and the entry of humanitarian aid to the enclave have been underway, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the discussions told Reuters on Sunday. However, there was no immediate comment from the US State Department.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLast week, Israel’s security cabinet unanimously approved a plan to expand the military offensive in the Gaza Strip, and thousands of reservists have since been called up. The plan is expected to only be implemented after Trump’s visit to the region this week, and until then, efforts will be made to reach an agreement with Hamas on a ceasefire and hostage deal.\nHuckabee’s announcement\nOn Friday, Huckabee announced that a US-backed mechanism for distributing aid into Gaza should take effect soon, while giving few details on the initiative.\nThe ambassador said that several partners had already committed to taking part in the aid arrangement but declined to name them, saying details would be released in the coming days.\nUS Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee holds a press conference at the US Embassy in Jerusalem, May 9, 2025. (Oren Ben Hakoon/Flash90)\nHe also argued that it was “wholly inaccurate” to describe the humanitarian aid initiative being launched in Gaza as Israeli, saying media reports characterizing it as such were “off the mark.”\nHuckabee confirmed that the aid operation “is ongoing” but said Israel’s involvement will only be “on the perimeters” in securing the aid distribution zones and that the Israelis “care very much about humanitarian aid to Gaza, but they also care that Hamas doesn’t steal the aid.”\nAsked by The Times of Israel how a potential ceasefire with Hamas could affect the initiative if it requires an IDF withdrawal to buffer zones, Huckabee said that “any ceasefire still requires security,” and the focus in any case will be getting the food to the Gazan population. He also said that humanitarian aid wasn’t dependent on the existence of a ceasefire.\nHe stated that the key elements of the plan were to get food distributed efficiently and safely, and prevent the Hamas terror group from getting its hands on it and stealing it. He panned Hamas as “100% responsible for the horrific situation” in the enclave, accusing the group’s leaders of “starving their people” and preventing a solution. He urged unanimous international condemnation of its “torturing of hostages in tunnels.”\nHuckabee declined to give a timeline for when the aid will begin being distributed, beyond insisting that it will hopefully be very soon.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe US envoy acknowledged that the initiative “won’t be perfect — especially in its early days.”\n“It is a logistical challenge to make this work,” he said.\nUS President Donald Trump, left, shakes hands with Assistant to the President, Senior Adviser and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff after Witkoff’s swearing-in ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on May 6, 2025.

Organizers instead sufficed with the press conference held on Friday by Huckabee.\nIn the meantime, the Trump administration is pressuring international humanitarian organizations to cooperate with the new plan, three sources familiar with the matter told The Times of Israel last week.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAmid this pushback from various groups, the Trump administration has indicated to these organizations — including the World Food Programme — that their US funding could be slashed if they do not cooperate, a staffer at an international aid group, a senior Western diplomat and an Israeli official told The Times of Israel.\nLazar Berman contributed to this report."}
