He was the first high-profile protester to be arrested under Trump\u2019s campaign to expel foreign students who participated in pro-Palestinian advocacy.Just this week, Farbiarz appeared poised to order Khalil\u2019s release, on the basis that his detention under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was unconstitutional.That law stipulates that the secretary of state \u2013 in this case, Marco Rubio \u2013 has the power to remove foreign nationals who have \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States\u201d.

In exchange, some sanctions were lifted from Iran.While the deal was lauded as an achievement of diplomacy, Israel disapproved of the JCPOA. Ten years later, the US and Iran appeared interested in striking another similar deal.The former ostensibly did not want to get dragged into a regional war as tensions mounted across the Middle East, while the latter was again looking for much-needed sanction relief.But Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran, which were reportedly planned months in advance and with US approval, have scuttled any diplomatic solution in the short term, said Akbari.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that someone in the shoes of Iran\u2019s supreme leader [Ali Khamenei] is not taking the side of hardliners after this,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.In response to Israel\u2019s strikes, Iran has launched drones and ballistic missiles at Israel, with some hitting targets on the ground.In the past, Iran\u2019s deterrence against external aggression relied primarily on its self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d.The axis consisted of powerful armed groups across the region, such as Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, as well as Syria under former President Bashar al-Assad.However, Hezbollah\u2019s capabilities were degraded significantly during the peak of its recent war with Israel, which lasted from September to late November last year.Al-Assad\u2019s fall in December, the culmination of a more than decade-long civil war in Syria, also compromised Iran\u2019s ability to resupply Hezbollah through Syria, as it used to do.Trump is now exploiting Iran\u2019s weakness by urging it to capitulate to a deal that would see it give up its nuclear programme, said Michael Stephens, an expert on regional response to Iran\u2019s nuclear programme with the Royal United Service Institute (RUSI), a defence think tank.On Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social that Iran must make a deal before there is \u201cnothing left\u201d of the country and that the next Israeli attacks will be even \u201cmore brutal\u201d.Later that evening, Israel carried out more air strikes on Iran\u2019s military sites and nuclear facilities.\u201cThere are no good options for [Iran] really,\u201d said Stephens.\u201cEither Khamenei \u2026 orders his negotiators to compromise on the nuclear file or \u2026 he holds firm [and] more sites are hit and further targeted assassinations of high-level officials take place,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\u201cEither way, if Iran decides to sprint towards a bomb, it\u2019s going to be very, very difficult to do that now,\u201d he added.Despite Iran\u2019s military weakness compared with the US and Israel, it is wary of giving up its nuclear programme, analysts told Al Jazeera.Negar Mortazavi, an expert on Iran with the Centre for International Policy (CIP), said Iranian officials have long referred to the fate of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who agreed to give up his nuclear weapons programme in exchange for US sanction relief in 2003.The deal came after the US President George W Bush had launched his so-called \u201cWar on Terror\u201d after the September 11, 2001, attacks, which led to the invasion and prolonged occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.At the time, Bush warned his partners and foes in the region that they were either \u201cwith us or against us\u201d.Eight years after Gaddafi gave up his nuclear programme, the US backed a pro-democracy uprising in Libya, which spiralled into an armed rebellion and led to Gaddafi\u2019s overthrow and eventual death.\u201cThe [Libya] scenario is something that Iran has taken notice of, and they don\u2019t want to go down that path,\u201d Mortazavi explained.She added that Iran may likely pull out from the JCPOA and try to quickly expand its nuclear programme in reaction to Israel\u2019s ongoing assault.\u201cJust how far and how soon Iran will expand its nuclear programme is unclear,\u201d Mortazavi told Al Jazeera."}

Protesters intended to camp near the border before returning to Cairo on June 19.However, Egyptian police stopped several groups of foreign nationals en route, forcing vehicles to pull over roughly 30km (20 miles) from Ismailia, just outside the Sinai. Activists said police ordered passengers with non-Egyptian passports to disembark, blocking their passage to Rafah.Paul Murphy, an independent Irish member of parliament, who has travelled to Egypt to take part, said in a post on X, \u201cWe have had our passports confiscated and are being detained. It seems Egyptian authorities have decided to crack down on the Great March To Gaza.\u201dMo, a member of the protest march from the Netherlands, said that his group had headed in taxis to Ismailia, but that at a checkpoint near the city foreigners were told to hand over their passports, with only Egyptians allowed through. He also described riot police who came to clear the road of protesters.Now back in Cairo, Mo and the group from the Netherlands are deciding what to do next.\u201cWe are trying to regroup,\u201d he told Al Jazeera. \u201cA lot of our group is splintered, some have been beaten up by the police\u2026 so they\u2019re coming back battered and bruised and broken.\u201d\u201cIt seems like the Egyptian authorities are determined to stop us from reaching anywhere near the border.\u201dSecurity sources told the Reuters news agency that at least 88 individuals had been detained or deported from Cairo airport and other locations across the country.Three airport sources told Reuters that at least 73 foreign nationals were deported on a flight to Istanbul for violating entry protocols, with about 100 more still awaiting deportation at the airport.Officials at Cairo International Airport said new directives were issued to airlines requiring all passengers travelling to Egypt between June 12 and 16 to hold confirmed return tickets, Reuters reported.Egypt\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said that any visits to the Rafah border area must be coordinated in advance with Egyptian embassies or official bodies, citing security concerns in the Sinai.Organisers of the march maintain they coordinated the trip with authorities and called on the government to release those detained.Separately, a land convoy known as \u201cSoumoud\u201d, which had departed Tunisia carrying activists from Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania, was stopped on Friday morning at the entrance to Sirte, a city in Libya under the control of forces loyal to military commander Khalifa Haftar.\u201cThe caravan was barred from passing through at the entrance to the city of Sirte,\u201d Tunisian organiser Wael Naouar said in a video posted on Facebook.Naouar said the convoy needs Egyptian authorisation to reach Gaza but had received mixed messages from local security officials. \u201cSome told us we could cross in a few hours. Others insisted that \u2018Egypt has denied [passage] and therefore you will not pass,'\u201d he said.On Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz ordered the military to block demonstrators from entering Gaza from Egypt, claiming people involved were \u201cjihadist protesters\u201d.\u201cI expect the Egyptian authorities to prevent them from reaching the Egypt-Israel border and not allow them to carry out provocations and try to enter Gaza,\u201d he added.It comes as Israel continues its relentless air strikes on Gaza, while severely restricting the flow of aid, including food, water, and medical supplies, as humanitarian experts warn that the enclave could fall into full-scale famine unless Israel lifts the blockade."}

Hamas has denounced what it described as an Israeli decision to cut communication lines in Gaza, calling it \u201ca new aggressive step\u201d in the country\u2019s \u201cwar of extermination\u201d.Israel continues to force civilians into what it calls the \u201csafe zone\u201d of al-Mawasi, a barren coastal strip with no infrastructure, which it has repeatedly bombed. A drone strike on a tent there killed at least two people on Friday.The attack left \u201ceveryone on the ground quite confused about where they can go in order to find safety\u201d, Azzoum said.In the occupied West Bank, Israel sealed all crossings and checkpoints between Palestinian towns and cities early on Friday, shortly after it launched a wave of air strikes on targets in Iran.Sources told Al Jazeera the closures were imposed without any indication of when they might be lifted.The Palestine Red Crescent Society said its ambulances were being denied access to patients, including those in urgent need of medical care.In occupied East Jerusalem, Israeli forces closed Al-Aqsa Mosque, preventing Palestinians from attending Friday prayers.Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa held an emergency cabinet meeting in response and activated crisis committees across the West Bank."}
