The past week has seen an intensification of violence across the besieged Palestinian territory, which has killed hundreds of people.The reason for the disappearance of the NGO provision remains unclear, and experts warned it may yet reappear in the bill before the final vote in the House, expected later in the week.The office of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.With a razor-thin majority in the House, Republicans need every vote to pass the tax bill, which Trump has put at the top of his agenda in Congress.Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the section may have been removed to avoid additional controversy for the must-pass bill, especially because the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan office that oversees procedures, may have rejected it for violating the rules.“It’s possible that this is a hiccup that they didn’t want, given that it wasn’t even likely to go through,” Hamadanchy told Al Jazeera.“I can’t tell you that is the reason for sure. What I can tell you is that we continue to be very vigilant in case it comes back, either later this week or in the future.”For weeks, Trump has been calling on Congress to pass the bill, which extends his 2017 tax cuts, a key component of his economic plans.But the proposal has faced some opposition from conservative budget hawks, who have argued it does not cut spending enough and would add to the nation’s $36.2 trillion debt. So Republicans can ill-afford unnecessary issues that could derail the passage of the legislation.Rights groups have been rallying against the “nonprofit killer”, saying it violates free speech and the right to due process.The proposal would have granted the secretary of state power to unilaterally declare an NGO “terrorist supporting” and make it ineligible for tax exemptions.It also said the government would not have to reveal the reason behind the designation if “disclosure of such description would be inconsistent with national security or law enforcement interests”.Under the current rules, organisations certified to be nonprofits by the government get breaks on their federal income taxes. The status also makes donations to such groups tax deductible for donors.While the withdrawn measure would have allowed a targeted NGO to challenge the secretary of state’s decision in court, losing the tax exempt status, even if temporarily, could have proven costly for nonprofits, especially smaller organisations.Hamadanchy said being accused of supporting terrorism could also have prompted banks to close down the accounts of the groups.“And then you have legal costs fighting off the designation because even if you might win in court, it’s going to take time to get there, and it’s going to cause a lot of damage to your organisation through that process,” he said.“And that’s sort of the point because they want to chill speech.”Hamadanchy noted that existing laws already make material support for a designated “terrorist” group a criminal offence with severe penalties.The legislative push coincided with the Trump administration’s crackdown on Palestinian rights supporters, especially on college campuses.Secretary of State Marco Rubio has revoked the student visas of several Palestine advocates – who have not been charged with a criminal offence – over allegations of “support for terrorism”.Some advocacy groups have portrayed the “nonprofit killer” as part of a broader push to muzzle voices critical of Israel.“This bill is designed to silence dissent, especially from Muslim, Palestinian and civil rights organizations that speak out against injustice and genocide,” the Council on American Islamic Relations said in a statement last week.“It threatens every nonprofit that engages in advocacy, educates the public, or challenges government policy.”The apparent setback for the nonprofit provision came nearly two weeks after House leaders cancelled a vote on a bill to restrict boycotts of Israel after a backlash from right-wing legislators who voiced opposition to the measure on free speech grounds.Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, said it would be “interesting” to see how Republican leaders would deal with staunchly pro-Israel measures like the “nonprofit killer” going forward.“They on the one hand likely see this as a fun opportunity to embarrass Democrats – whose opposition will be framed as anti-Israel or enabling terror and antisemitism – and on the other hand they have to worry about principled opposition from within their own ranks,” Friedman told Al Jazeera in a statement."}

Food security experts last week warned of famine amid accusations that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war.“Significantly more aid must be allowed into Gaza starting tomorrow morning,” Fletcher said in a statement.The UN secretary-general’s spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, confirmed the limited aid will be distributed through the world body’s mechanisms but also reiterated the amount of aid crossing into Gaza “is not enough”.The Israeli decision on Sunday to allow “minimal” aid into Gaza came as it launched an intensified ground offensive during an ongoing heavy bombardment that has killed hundreds of people over the past week.On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video address pressure from international “allies” was behind the move.Israel’s “greatest friends in the world”, he declared without mentioning specific countries, had said there is “‘one thing we cannot stand. We cannot accept images of hunger, mass hunger. We cannot stand that. We will not be able to support you’.“Therefore, to achieve victory, we need to somehow solve the problem,” Netanyahu said, stressing the aim of the intensified offensive is for Israel’s forces to “take control of all” of Gaza.Still, far-right members of his coalition government slammed the aid decision, with National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir calling it a “grave mistake”.It came as the leaders of Britain, France and Canada warned their countries would take action, including possible sanctions, if Israel does not halt its renewed military offensive in Gaza and lift aid restrictions.“The Israeli Government’s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable and risks breaching International Humanitarian Law,” a joint statement released by the British government said, also expressing opposition to any attempt to expand settlements in the occupied West Bank.“We will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions,” it added.Separately, 22 donor countries also issued a joint statement on Monday urging Israel to “allow a full resumption of aid into Gaza immediately”.“Whilst we acknowledge indications of a limited restart of aid,” Gaza’s population “faces starvation” and “must receive the aid they desperately need”, it said.The statement was signed by the foreign ministers of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK.Israel has been accused of weaponising hunger and using the blockade to try to ethnically cleanse Gaza.The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a US-based Muslim and Arab rights group, said the decision to allow a handful of aid trucks into the territory is an effort to buy goodwill as Israel continues a relentless military campaign that has killed more than 53,000 people over the past 19 months.“This is a completely insufficient, psychotic PR stunt by Netanyahu’s genocidal government, which is determined to occupy and flatten Gaza, and then expel any Palestinians who survive,” it said in a statement.Speaking at the opening of the annual World Health Assembly on Monday, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that Israel’s block on aid has driven up the risk of famine.“Two million people are starving,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned, noting that 160,000 tonnes of food are “blocked at the border just minutes away”.He said the WHO and other UN agencies stood ready to deliver aid into Gaza – if and when entrance is allowed. “People are dying from preventable diseases as medicines wait at the border, while attacks on hospitals deny people care and deter them from seeking it,” Tedros added.On Sunday, the Health Ministry in Gaza said the Indonesian Hospital, one of the largest partially functioning medical facilities in northern Gaza, had ceased work because of Israeli attacks.As Israel intensifies its offensive across Gaza, sources told the Reuters news agency there has been no progress in a new round of indirect talks in Qatar’s capital, Doha between the Israeli government and Hamas, the Palestinian group that headed an attack in southern Israel on October 7, 2023 that killed an estimated 1,139 people, with more than 200 also taken captive."}

Here’s a recap of today’s main events:A United Nations human rights official has questioned the validity of the threat by France, the UK, and Canada to impose “targeted sanctions” on Israel over its attacks on Gaza and the occupied West Bank.“Targeting whom? You need to impose sanctions on the state. It’s not about the prime minister. This is the entire government enterprise,” said Francesca Albanese, the UN’s special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories.The plan to use the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to bypass entrenched humanitarian aid mechanisms used for decades in Gaza is “one of the most appalling things I’ve seen in my career”, Albanese told Al Jazeera.“This is a landslide moment. Millions of people from around the world have been protesting. People have been fired from their jobs. People have been arrested and detained for asking for the end of a genocide, crimes committed against women and children. People cannot stand this anymore.”Israel will permit minimal food aid to Gaza temporarily, but Netanyahu insists on controlling distribution to block Hamas.In an interview with Al Jazeera, Olga Cherevko of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) called the move insufficient after more than 10 weeks of total blockade, stressing that Gaza faces “catastrophic” conditions with starvation looming.We’ve been reporting on Canada, France and the UK’s statement warning Israel to halt its assault on Gaza and the occupied West Bank, while mentioning “targeted sanctions” as a response.Hamas welcomed the joint statement, describing the three nations’ stance as “an important step” towards restoring the principles of international law.The Western countries also slammed “abhorrent language used recently by members of the Israeli government threatening that, in their despair at the destruction of Gaza, civilians will start to relocate”.“Permanent forced displacement is a breach of international humanitarian law,” the statement noted.Israel’s ground-and-air war has devastated Gaza, displacing nearly all its 2.3 million residents and killing more than 53,000 people, the majority of them women, children and the elderly.Palestinian activist Issa Amro spoke to AJ+ after he was harassed by Israeli soldiers and settlers following his appearance in The Settlers, a documentary by journalist Louis Theroux.Issa is a human rights defender involved in nonviolent resistance against Israel’s illegal occupation, and this is not the first time he has been targeted.Issa lives in Hebron, a city in the occupied West Bank, where more than 250,000 Palestinians live under constant harassment and surveillance.The French president has reiterated strong opposition against Israel’s intensification of its offensive in Gaza, saying the level of human suffering in the enclave is “intolerable”.“We firmly oppose the expansion of Israeli military operations in Gaza. The level of human suffering is intolerable,” Emmanuel Macron said on X, sharing a joint statement by the United Kingdom, Canada, and France that threatened to take action against Israel over its actions in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.“In the lead-up to the June 18 conference [on Palestinian statehood] in New York, we must all work toward implementing the two-state solution,” Macron added.Saudi Arabia and France will chair the international conference next month with United Nations backing, aimed at establishing a roadmap for Palestinian statehood.Arbel Yehoud, who was released after 482 days in captivity in a ceasefire earlier this year, told Israeli lawmakers at a parliamentary committee that they’ll have blood on their hands “if you do not stop the war”.Yehoud’s partner, Ariel Cunio, is still held in Gaza along with 57 other captives, 23 of whom are believed to be alive.She said she was terrified by the sound of bombs while she was being held. “As someone who was there, I know that only through negotiations is [returning the captives] possible,” Yehoud said.Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri blamed Israel’s leaders for the lack of progress at truce talks in Qatar, and said that escalating its military offensive would be “a death sentence” for the remaining captives.The Palestinian ambassador to the UK has told Al Jazeera that the statement by Canada, France and the UK threatening action against Israel if it does not stop a renewed military offensive in Gaza and lift aid restrictions is “19 months late”, but is nevertheless “very significant”.“Coming from [some of] the strongest allies of Israel, and after 19 months of utter silence from these capitals, it is very significant,” Husam Zomlot told Al Jazeera from LondonHe said that Palestinians want to build on this statement, and that he wanted these states to impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Israel, sanction state figures, work to hold Israeli war criminals to account, and recognise Palestine as an independent state.“We need to save whatever is left of our lives and the lives of our people. We must make sure that we save whatever is left of international law, including the convention to prevent the crime of genocide, and we want to save our humanity,” Zomlot added.“So, of course, we have so much to despair [about] but we also have a lot to do to make sure that international actors, including the UK, take their responsibilities seriously.”Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has slammed a statement by the governments of France, the United Kingdom, and Canada saying they could sanction Israel if it doesn’t end a new ground invasion of Gaza.“By asking Israel to end a defensive war for our survival before Hamas terrorists on our border are destroyed and by demanding a Palestinian state, the leaders in London, Ottawa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel … while inviting more such atrocities,” he said in a social media post.Israel is fighting a war of “civilization over barbarism” and will continue until it achieves “total victory”, Netanyahu added.His post also called on European nations to accept US President Donald Trump’s vision for Gaza.“That means the expulsion of more than two million Palestinians from their home country,” Al Jazeera correspondent Hamdah Salhut reported from Jordan. “The statement is saying that European leaders should get behind this as well.”Al-Awda Hospital says among the dead in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza were a woman and a young girl.The strike also wounded 18 others, mostly children, said the hospital, which received the casualties.The Israeli army said it attacked a Hamas “command-and control” centre “used by terrorists to plan and execute attacks”. The army often uses the justification when it kills civilians in Gaza’s crowded displacement camps.In December, at least 36 people were killed in an Israeli air strike on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central GazaMore than 97,000 Palestinians have been displaced in the Gaza Strip over the past four days, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has said, warning that displacement is a “constant” in Gaza.“Humanitarian aid must never be used to influence the movement of people”, the United Nations’ IOM also wrote on X, after several organisations raised concerns that a planned Israeli-US scheme to take over aid distribution could lead to the displacement of more people and could be used as a tool to de-populate Gaza.Forced evacuation orders throughout Israel’s 19-month war have displaced the majority of Gaza’s population multiple times.Earlier on Monday, Israel’s military issued another forced displacement order to residents of Gaza’s southern city of Khan Younis, threatening an “unprecedented” assault after launching a new ground invasion.Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis have announced what they called a “maritime blockade” on Israel’s Port of Haifa in response to Israel’s ongoing escalation in Gaza.“All companies with ships present in or heading to this port are hereby notified that, as of the time of this announcement, the aforementioned port has been included in the list of targets,” the group’s spokesperson, Yahya Saree, said in a televised address.The Houthis have continued to fire missiles at Israel, including at Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv, in what they say is solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, although they have agreed to halt attacks on US ships.The missiles launched by the group at Israel were mostly intercepted.Israel has carried out strikes in response, including one on May 6 that damaged Yemen’s main airport in Sanaa and killed several people.Apparently, the United States has grown tired of hearing Palestinians in Gaza say they are starving. So now, it has decided to end the hunger, or at least the annoying complaints about it.The Israeli government, “under US pressure”, announced it will let in “a basic quantity of food” in order to prevent “the development of a hunger crisis”.Here in Gaza, where the hunger crisis is already “well-developed”, we are hardly surprised by these announcements. We are well used to Israel – with foreign backing – turning on and off the “food button” as it pleases.Read this full opinion piece here.The number of Palestinian journalists killed in Israel’s war on Gaza since October 7, 2023, has risen to 219, according to the Gaza Government Media Office.On Friday, Reporters Without Borders said Palestine has become the world’s most dangerous state for journalists, with dozens of reporters killed by Israeli forces, likely due to their work.Israeli forces have reportedly targeted all three power generators at the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, leaving the key facility without its primary power sources, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary has reported.“The hospital is now operating on backup energy from solar panel batteries, which are expected to last only a few more hours,” she wrote in an update on X.“Medical staff warn that patients in the intensive care unit are at imminent risk as power supplies dwindle.”A senior Hamas official says Israel insists on a partial deal to release some captives without committing to ending the war.Hamas will only release the remaining abductees in return for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire, and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The Hamas official was not authorised to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity, The Associated Press reported.Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said in a video message that Israel would achieve “complete victory” with both the release of the 58 captives held by Hamas in Gaza and the destruction of Hamas.Benjamin Netanyahu says US senators he has known for years as supporters of Israel – “our best friends in the world” – are telling him that desperate scenes of hunger in Gaza are draining vital support and bringing Israel close to a “red line, to a point where we might lose control”.“It is for that reason, in order to achieve victory, we have to somehow solve the problem,” Netanyahu said in a message apparently addressed to far-right hardliners in his government who have insisted aid be denied to Gaza.Last week, 29 US Senate Democrats introduced a resolution urging the Trump administration to use “all diplomatic tools” to stop the Israeli blockade and allow aid to enter the Gaza Strip.“I’m offering a resolution with my colleagues that makes a simple point: it notes simply that children are starving to death. They’re starving to death as we are here comfortably debating what we think are important issues,” said Senator Peter Welch.“And it must be the effort of all of us to do all we can to bring this siege and this war to an immediate end.”A speech by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was interrupted by protesters over the company’s provision of AI services to the Israeli military.“BREAKING! No Azure for Apartheid disrupts Satya’s keynote during Microsoft Build! SHUT DOWN MICROSOFT BUILD FOR PALESTINE!” a group of Microsoft workers opposed to the company’s work with Israel said in a social media post.It includes a video showing a protester rising to his feet and saying, “How about you show how Microsoft is killing Palestinians? How about you show how Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?”As the demonstrator is carried out of the room by security, he says he’s a Microsoft worker and refuses “to be complicit in this genocide”.The Israeli military has been assisted by artificial intelligence (AI) programmes designed to produce targets with little human oversight. It is not clear to what extent foreign tech giants are directly involved.At least one person has been killed in Israeli attacks on multiple locations across southern Lebanon despite a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.An Israeli drone strike on the outskirts of the border village of Hula killed one person, the Lebanese Health Ministry said in a statement. In two other incidents near the border, three people were wounded.On Sunday, two people, including a Lebanese soldier, were wounded in an Israeli strike, the army said.The Israeli military said it launched a strike against a Hezbollah member and was not operating against the Lebanese army.Israel has continued attacks on its neighbour despite the November 27 truce that sought to halt more than a year of hostilities with Hezbollah, including two months of full-blown war.

Human rights groups and United Nations-backed experts have accused Israel of systematically destroying Gaza’s healthcare system.Earlier, Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of al-Shifa Hospital in the besieged enclave’s north, told Al Jazeera on Sunday that the latest strikes – which have been ongoing since Saturday – indicate that Israeli attacks on Gaza’s hospitals are intensifying.“The medical teams are really suffering, and we have a few numbers of medical teams and staff … and a lot of people are in need [of] more medical care,” Abu Salmiya said by phone from the hospital on Sunday.Thousands of sick and wounded people could die, he warned. Blood donations are urgently needed.This has been underscored by Gaza’s Health Ministry, which confirmed that Israeli forces besieged the facility in Beit Lahiya, adding that “a state of panic and confusion is prevailing”.The ministry later said that Israel had cut off the arrival of patients and staff, “effectively forcing the hospital out of service”.With “the shutdown of the Indonesian Hospital, all public hospitals in the North Gaza Governorate are now out of service”, it said.Gaza’s healthcare facilities have been targeted repeatedly throughout Israel’s deadly assault that began 18 months ago.Other facilities in the north that have been bombed, burned, and besieged by the Israeli military since the start of the war include Kamal Adwan Hospital, al-Shifa Hospital, al-Ahli Hospital, and al-Awda Hospital. Dozens of other medical clinics, stations, and vehicles have also come under attack.The targeting of health facilities, medical personnel and patients is considered a war crime under the 1949 Geneva Convention.Israel has also battered several hospitals in Gaza’s central and southern areas, including Deir el-Balah’s Al-Aqsa Hospital and the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.Earlier this week, Israel struck two hospitals in Khan Younis. Nine missiles slammed into and around the courtyard of the European Gaza Hospital, killing at least 16 people, while an attack on the Nasser Medical Complex killed two people, including a wounded journalist.Incessant attacks on Gaza’s healthcare sector have left it reeling, devastating its ability to function, while doctors say they are out of medicine to treat routine conditions.Hospitals have also been on the verge of total collapse amid a brutal and ongoing blockade, where Israel continues to bar the entry of much-needed medical supplies, fuel, and other humanitarian aid including food and clean water.The crisis in Gaza has reached one of its darkest periods, humanitarian officials warn, as famine also looms.Israeli air strikes have killed hundreds of Palestinians in the last 72 hours.Strikes over the weekend have also put the European Hospital, the only remaining facility providing cancer treatments in Gaza, out of service.Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said dozens of Palestinians have been wounded, and doctors say “they’re facing numerous challenges in treating injuries because of a lack of medical supplies”.“Israeli air strikes in Gaza are still escalating as drones and fighter jets hover in the sky,” Khoudary said.The death toll has reached the same level of intensity as the earliest days of the war, said Emily Tripp, executive director of Airwars, an independent group in London that tracks recent conflicts.She says preliminary data indicate the number of incidents where at least one person was killed or injured by Israeli fire hovered around 700 in April. It’s a figure comparable only to October or December 2023 – one of the heaviest periods of bombardment.In the last 10 days of March, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimates, an average of 100 children were killed or maimed by Israeli air strikes every day.Almost 3,000 of the estimated 53,000 killed by Israel since October 7, 2023, have lost their lives since Israel broke a fragile ceasefire on March 18, Gaza’s Health Ministry said.Among those killed in recent days include a volunteer pharmacist with the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, who was killed with her family in a strike on Gaza City on May 4.A midwife from Al Awda Health and Community Association was also killed with her family in another strike on May 7.A journalist working for Qatar-based television network Al Araby TV, along with 11 members of his family, was also killed."}

The dead and wounded were taken to a nearby field hospital and the Nasser Medical Complex.At least 135 people were killed on Sunday morning, including 42 in the heavily bombed northern parts of Gaza, medical sources told Al Jazeera Arabic. Five journalists were also among the victims when their homes were bombed.At least 464 Palestinians have been killed in the past week as the Israeli military prepared to significantly intensify its ground invasion of the Palestinian territory despite international criticism. At least 53,339 Palestinians have been killed and 121,034 wounded since the start of the war in October 2023, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health.The Israeli army on Sunday confirmed the start of Operation Gideon’s Chariots, which will involve regular and reserve soldiers of the Southern Command leading the ground invasion of both northern and southern Gaza, backed by the air force.It reported attacking more than 670 places in Gaza over the past week and claimed all were “Hamas targets” located both above and beneath the ground. Israel has been accused of disproportionately targeting civilians in Gaza, including displaced families.Among the targets have been three major hospitals, adding to the systematic targeting of healthcare facilities across the enclave that has now put three hospitals out of commission this week alone.The Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza was rendered nonoperational on Sunday after the Israeli army laid siege to it beginning at dawn. Marwan al-Sultan, the director of the facility, which was the last functioning public hospital in the north, described the situation as “catastrophic” and called on international organisations to press for medical teams’ safety.Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, told Al Jazeera that the bombing of the Indonesian Hospital is severely impacting chances of survival for those in need of medical care.Thousands of sick and wounded people could die, he warned, adding that blood donations are urgently needed.Dr Muhammad Zaqout, the director general of hospitals in Gaza, condemned “Israel’s systematic measures against hospitals”.“Israel deliberately kills wounded people by preventing them from reaching hospitals and directly targets patients, the wounded and medical staff inside hospitals,” he told Al Jazeera.He said al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza’s Jabalia and European Gaza Hospital in southern Gaza have also been bombed, endangering patients and medical staff.Hamas said in a statement early on Sunday that the attacks on displaced Palestinians in Khan Younis marked a “brutal crime” that was a flagrant violation of international laws and norms.“By granting the terrorist occupation government political and military cover, the United States administration bears direct responsibility for this insane escalation in the targeting of innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip, including children, women, and the elderly,” the Palestinian group said, also condemning the “ongoing persecution and killing” of media workers.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Israel’s expanding operation in Gaza. “I am alarmed by reported plans by Israel to expand ground operations and more,” he said on X on Saturday.On Saturday, both Israel and Hamas confirmed that more mediated talks were under way in Qatar.Israel emphasised that the talks are being held with no conditions, including the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which it has completely blocked since March 2 despite looming famine.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signalled on Sunday that his government may be open to either a partial or a comprehensive agreement but only under strict conditions.“Even at this very moment, the negotiation team in Doha is working to exhaust every possibility for a deal – whether according to the Witkoff framework or as part of ending the fighting, which would include the release of all the hostages, the exile of Hamas terrorists, and the disarmament of the Gaza Strip,” his office said in a statement, referring to White House envoy Steve Witkoff.His office also slammed former Israeli negotiator Oren Setter, who resigned from the team in October and said in a February interview that Netanyahu had squandered two opportunities last year that would have released captives in exchange for ending the war.Setter, a retired brigadier general, criticised Netanyahu on Sunday, telling the public broadcaster Kan that he is concerned the government will once again “miss the opportunity” of a comprehensive agreement in favour of a potential partial deal.Far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir on Sunday called on Netanyahu to pull the negotiating team back from Doha and refrain from signing any deal with Hamas. He insisted that Hamas must be completely defeated, fulfilling a war goal set out by Israel from the start."}

But is Washington’s support complicating efforts to reach a permanent ceasefire?The United Nations had warned of the risk of famine in Gaza long before the aid blockade was imposed on the coastal enclave, and doctors at Kamal Adwan Hospital told a World Health Organization team last year that at least 10 children had starved to death.Israel has faced increasing pressure to lift its aid blockade, as UN agencies warn of critical shortages of food, clean water, fuel and medicine.Marwan al-Hams, director of field hospitals at Gaza’s Health Ministry, said that since the blockade began, “57 children have died in Gaza as a result of famine, but in the coming days this number will increase due to the depletion of available food supplies”.At least 3,193 people have been killed since Israel resumed strikes on March 18, taking the war’s overall toll to 53,339, the ministry said on Sunday.Noura Erakat, a human rights attorney, has urged United Nations member states to use their powers to end Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza and protect the rights and lives of Palestinians.Every year, Palestinians around the world remember the Nakba – the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians during the creation of the state of Israel.Between 1947 and 1949, Zionist militias attacked Palestinian cities and villages, killing about 13,000 people and destroying more than 530 villages. At least 750,000 Palestinians were forcibly expelled from their homes, becoming refugees.Here are the stories of five Palestinians who share their memories of displacement and loss – as well as their hope to return home.Tens of thousands of red-clad protesters have marched through The Hague in the Netherlands to demand that their government do more to halt Israel’s war on Gaza, in what organizers called the country’s biggest demonstration in two decades.Human rights groups and aid agencies – including Amnesty International, Save the Children and Doctors Without Borders (MSF) – estimated the peaceful crowd at more than 100,000 people on the streets of The Hague.“We are calling on the Dutch government: stop political, economic and military support to Israel as long as it blocks access to aid supplies and while it is guilty of genocide, war crimes and structural human rights violations in Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories,” said Marjon Rozema of Amnesty.David Prins, 64, said he was attending the protest “to speak out against the atrocities”.In its latest assault on Gaza’s decimated healthcare system, Israel has again targeted the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, this time with drones.Health officials said fighting around the Indonesian Hospital and an Israeli military “siege” forced it to shut down.Read the full story here.Israel’s High Court of Justice has postponed a hearing set for May 21 on a petition for independent media access to Gaza, the Times of Israel reports.The court did not provide a reason for the postponement or set a new date to hear the petition filed by the Foreign Press Association (FPA), which represents international journalists working in Israel, the occupied West Bank and Gaza.Israel has prevented all international journalists from reporting independently inside Gaza since the outbreak of the war in October 2023.Yousef Munayyer from the Arab Center Washington DC says the timing of Israel’s announcement that it will allow “basic” aid into Gaza comes as pressure mounts and famine warnings rise.Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office said the move was made to assist the expansion of its military action in Gaza, but “that obviously does not make sense”, Munayyer told Al Jazeera.“The timing suggests this was not an announcement that was planned. What all of this suggests is that there’s been some pressure, particularly American pressure, on the Israeli government to let this aid in. Aid has been completely blocked for more than 78 days, and we’re seeing really scary images of starvation and malnutrition, particularly affecting the most vulnerable in Palestinian society.”French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that as Israel has finally announced the resumption of some goods to the Gaza Strip after months of total blockade, the entry of aid to the Strip “must be immediate, massive, and unhindered”.He said in a post on X that the aid “must put an end to the catastrophic humanitarian situation and definitively halt the famine”.Israel says it has retrieved the official Syrian archive on spy Eli Cohen – a cache of 2,500 documents, photographs, and personal effects linked to the Mossad agent executed in Damascus in 1965.“In a complex covert operation by the Mossad, in cooperation with a strategic partner service, the official Syrian archive on Eli Cohen was brought to Israel,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. “The trove contains thousands of items that had been kept under tight security by Syrian intelligence for decades.”Among the items recovered are a handwritten will penned by Cohen hours before his execution, audio recordings and files from his interrogations and those of his sources, letters he wrote to family members in Israel, and photographs from his clandestine mission in Syria.Netanyahu said retrieving the archive reflected Israel’s “unwavering commitment to bringing back all our missing, prisoners, and hostages”.A Palestinian woman was killed in an Israeli air strike that targeted a tent housing displaced people on Al-Barakah Street in Deir el-Balah, the central Gaza Strip, our colleagues at Al Jazeera Arabic report.Several others were also injured in the attack. Reporting from Amman, JordanAl Jazeera is reporting from Amman, Jordan, because it has been banned from Israel and the occupied West Bank.Israel will now allow the flow of humanitarian aid back into Gaza after a near 12-week blockade of humanitarian assistance.They’re going to allow the minimum amount of food “to ensure a hunger crisis does not develop”. It’s worth mentioning this hunger crisis has already ensued. The population has been starving. Once the ceasefire stopped, Israel completely blocked all aid.We’re not just talking about food. We’re talking about water, medical supplies, fuel for hospitals. None of that has entered Gaza in nearly three months. There’s been a lot of pressure on the prime minister, on the Israelis from a lot of international partners.You even had Donald Trump say “people are starving in Gaza”. Because of this pressure, Netanyahu finally decided to allow aid back in. But what the Israelis are saying is this will be a minimum amount of aid, just food, and it’s unclear still when exactly this will take place.Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has denounced Netanyahu’s move to allow aid into Gaza as a “grave mistake”.“Any humanitarian aid that enters Gaza will benefit Hamas while the hostages suffer in the tunnels,” Ben-Gvir said.“Netanyahu is making a grave mistake by deciding to bring in aid, and he doesn’t even have a majority for the decision. Hamas must be crushed, not given the means to survive.”Netanyahu said earlier that his cabinet had approved a decision to allow a “basic” amount of food into Gaza to enable Israel to expand its new military operation.Israel has imposed a complete blockade on all goods entering Gaza since March 2.Israel has blocked the entry of medical, food and fuel supplies into Gaza since the start of March. Health experts are warning that famine is imminent if the war isn’t stopped and aid deliveries resumed.US President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said the United States won’t allow a worsening disaster to come to fruition in Gaza.“We do not want to see a humanitarian crisis, and we will not allow it to occur on President Trump’s watch,” Witkoff told ABC News.The Israeli military campaign has devastated the enclave, pushing nearly all residents from their homes and killing more than 53,000 people, according to Gaza’s health authorities.As Arab leaders meet in Iraq, Mohamad Elmasry, a professor at the Doha Institute of Graduate Studies, says that while Arab states express a desire to end Israel’s war on Gaza, they haven’t taken “substantive action”.Israel says it will allow a “basic amount” of humanitarian aid into Gaza to avoid a famine, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has said, more than two months after Israel imposed a total blockade on goods that has left much of the Gaza Strip’s population facing starvation.“Due to the need to expand the fighting, we will introduce a basic amount of food to the residents of Gaza to ensure no famine occurs,” the prime minister’s office said in a statement.“A famine might jeopardise the continuation of Operation Gideon’s Chariots aimed at eliminating Hamas.”The PM’s office said that Israel would prevent Hamas from controlling the distribution of aid to ensure that it does not reach fighters.It was not immediately clear when aid would enter Gaza, or how.On March 2, Israel imposed a blockade on food, water and other critical supplies to the already besieged coastal territory.Benjamin Netanyahu has said in a video that Israel “will achieve victory in the Gaza Strip” as Israeli forces expand their operations in Gaza, without addressing the ongoing ceasefire negotiations in Doha.“There are two interconnected goals for the operation, which are to eliminate Hamas and to free the hostages, and we will achieve both,” he said.Netanyahu also said that Israel will “establish a barrier along the Jordan River from the [occupied Golan Heights] to Eilat to prevent the infiltration of terrorists and cells”."}

Katz said that Operation Gideon Chariots was being led with “great force.”The new offensive comes after Israel escalated its air attacks on Gaza, killing hundreds of Palestinians in the past three days. Many of the victims were killed in northern Gaza, including in Beit Lahiya and Jabalia, which have received forced displacement orders by the Israeli army in recent days.As leaders of the Arab League held a Gaza-focused summit in Iraq’s Baghdad and called for international funding to rebuild Gaza on Saturday, Hamas urged the international community to impose sanctions on Israel.In a statement on its Telegram channel, the armed group described the situation in Gaza as a “full-blown genocide committed before the eyes of a world that stands helpless, while more than two and a half million people are being slaughtered in the besieged Strip”.The group also reported continued fighting with invading Israeli forces, claiming on Saturday that its fighters killed and wounded two Israeli soldiers using machineguns in the Shujayea neighbourhood of Gaza City in the northern part of the enclave.United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said he was “alarmed” by Israel’s expanded offensive in Gaza and called for an immediate ceasefire.UN relief chief Tom Fletcher said a joint plan by the United States and Israel to replace international aid mechanisms in Gaza was a “waste of time” as more than 160,000 pallets of aid are “ready to move” at the border, but blocked by Israel.Germany voiced alarm over Israel’s expanded assault in Gaza, saying it was a “cause for deep concern.”“A large-scale military offensive also entails the risk that the catastrophic humanitarian situation for the population in Gaza and the situation of the remaining hostages will continue to deteriorate and that the prospect of an urgently needed long-term ceasefire fades,” the foreign ministry said in a statement."}

He called Israel a “dangerous cancerous tumour” that must be “uprooted”.Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also told a gathering of navy officers on Saturday that Trump is extending a message of peace while threatening destruction at the same time as backing Israel’s “genocide” in the Gaza Strip.“Which one of this president’s words should we believe? His message of peace, or his message of massacre of human beings?” the Iranian president said, pointing out that Trump sanctioned the International Criminal Court (ICC) in a move that was internationally criticised.The statements came after Trump used his Middle East tour – during which he signed huge deals with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates – to heap praise on Arab leaders neighbouring Iran and blasting the leadership in Tehran.The US president told Arab leaders they were developing their infrastructure while Iran’s “landmarks are collapsing into rubble” after its theocratic establishment replaced a monarchy in a 1979 revolution.He said Iran’s leaders have “managed to turn green farmland into dry deserts” as a result of corruption and mismanagement, and pointed out that Iranians are experiencing power outages several hours a day.The blackouts, a result of a years-long energy crisis that is hurting Iran’s already strained economy, are expected to linger for the rest of this year as well, according to Iranian authorities.The largest associations of the mining, steel and cement industries in Iran on Saturday wrote a joint letter to Pezeshkian, urgently requesting him to review a 90 percent electricity use restriction imposed on the critical sectors.Trump, who hailed Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa and lifted sanctions on Damascus, also took aim at Iran’s regional policy.He described Tehran’s support for the fallen establishment of President Bashar al-Assad as a cause of “misery and death” and regional destabilisation.Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the US president’s remarks as “deceptive”, telling state media on Friday it was the US that hampered Iran through sanctions and military threats while backing Israel and attacking Syria.Parliament chief Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who was addressing an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference in Indonesia, said Trump’s remarks showed he was “living in a delusion”.Hossein Salami, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), addressed Trump directly on Friday and said even though Iran has beautiful landmarks, “we take pride in the elevation of character, identity, culture, and Islam”.The sharp rhetoric in response to Trump’s latest controversial comments come days after he teased that he may start calling the “Persian Gulf” the “Arabian Gulf” soon.This angered Iranians across the board, prompting criticism of any attempt to rename the key waterway from average citizens online, authorities, local media, and even some pro-Trump Iranians outside the country who have been advocating for US sanctions and regime change.Both Iran and the US say they would prefer an agreement that would serve to quickly de-escalate tensions surrounding Iran’s nuclear programme, despite the latest war of words.But after four rounds of negotiations mediated by Oman, any prospective deal – which would lift sanctions in exchange for making sure Iran would not have a nuclear bomb – still appears to face significant hurdles.Trump said Tehran has been handed a proposal to rapidly advance towards a deal, but Iran’s Araghchi on Friday said no written proposal was produced yet amid “confusing and contradictory” rhetoric from Washington.“Mark my words: there is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to enrichment for peaceful purposes: a right afforded to all other NPT signatories, too,” he wrote in a post on X, in reference to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.Kazem Gharibabadi, a senior nuclear negotiator, on Friday rejected reports by Western media outlets that Iran may agree to fully halt its enrichment of uranium for the remainder of the Trump presidency to build trust.“The right to enrich is our absolute red line! No halt to enrichment is acceptable.”Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear accord signed between Iran and world powers three years earlier, imposing the harshest sanctions yet by the US that have only intensified during the latest negotiations.The nuclear deal set a 3.67 percent enrichment rate with first-generation centrifuges for civilian use in Iran, in exchange for lifting United Nations sanctions. Iran is now enriching up to 60 percent and has enough fissile material for multiple bombs, but has made no effort to build one yet."}

Many more could starve to death in the coming days and weeks unless immediate action is taken,” it said.Meanwhile, the Council of Europe, a body that works to safeguard human rights and democracy, also noted that Gaza was suffering from a “deliberate starvation” and warned that Israel was sowing “the seeds for the next Hamas” in the territory, referring to the Palestinian armed group.“The time for a moral reckoning over the treatment of Palestinians has come – and it is long overdue,” said Dora Bakoyannis, rapporteur for the Middle East at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.The European calls came hours after UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said 160,000 pallets of relief and 9,000 trucks were ready to enter Gaza.“To those proposing an alternative modality for aid distribution, let’s not waste time. We already have a plan,” he said in a statement.“We have the people. We have the distribution networks. We have the trust of the communities on the ground. And we have the aid itself – 160,000 pallets of it – ready to move. Now,” he said.“We demand rapid, safe, and unimpeded aid delivery for civilians in need. Let us work.”Israel has halted the entry of food, medication and all other essentials into Gaza since March 2. UN agencies and other humanitarian groups have warned of shrinking food, fuel and medicine supplies to the territory of 2.4 million Palestinians facing acute starvation.Earlier, the US and Israel said they were preparing a plan that would allow the resumption of aid by an NGO, while keeping supplies out of Hamas’s hands.Under the heavily criticised alternative aid plan, the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aims to start work in Gaza by the end of May.It intends to work with private US security and logistics firms to transport aid into Gaza to so-called secure hubs where it will then be distributed by aid groups, a source familiar with the plan told the Reuters news agency. It is unclear how the foundation will be funded.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has also asked Israel to allow humanitarian deliveries by the UN and aid groups to resume now until its infrastructure is fully operational, saying this is essential to “alleviate the ongoing humanitarian pressure”.The UN, however, said it would not work with the foundation because the distribution plan is not impartial, neutral or independent. Israel says the blockade, alongside “military pressure”, is intended to force Hamas to free the remaining captives.On Thursday, senior Hamas official Basem Naim reiterated the group’s position that the entry of aid into Gaza is a prerequisite for any truce talks with Israel.“Access to food, water and medicine is a fundamental human right – not a subject for negotiation,” he said."}

In recent days, Israel has intensified its offensive, as tens of thousands of Palestinians are forced to starve.At a preparatory meeting of the Arab League summit, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said they will try to endorse decisions that were made at their meeting in Cairo in March to support Gaza’s reconstruction as an alternative to Trump’s widely condemned proposal to take over the enclave.During his visit to Qatar, Trump on Thursday reiterated that he wanted the US to “take” Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone”. Earlier this year, he caused an uproar by declaring that the US would turn Gaza into a “Riviera of the Middle East”, prompting Arab leaders to come up with a plan to rebuild the territory, at a summit in Cairo.The Arab plan for Gaza proposes rebuilding the Palestinian enclave without displacing its 2.4 million residents.Besides Gaza, Arab officials also discussed Syria, which only six months ago entered a new chapter in its history after the fall of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad.Earlier this week, Trump in Riyadh met Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose group spearheaded the offensive that toppled al-Assad last December. Prior to their meeting, he also announced that US sanctions on Syria will be lifted in a huge boost to the government in Damascus.Al-Sharaa, who was imprisoned for years in Iraq on charges of belonging to al-Qaeda following the 2003 US-led invasion, however, missed Baghdad’s summit after several powerful Iraqi politicians voiced opposition to his visit. The Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani represented Damascus instead.Saturday’s summit also came amid Iran’s ongoing nuclear talks with the US. Trump has pursued diplomacy with Iran as he seeks to stave off a threatened military strike by Israel on Iran, a desire shared by many of the region’s leaders.On Thursday, Trump said a deal was “getting close”, but by Friday, he was warning that “something bad is going to happen” if the Iranians do not move fast.Iraq has only recently regained a semblance of normalcy after decades of devastating conflict and turmoil, and its leaders view the summit as an opportunity to project an image of stability.Reporting from Baghdad, Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud Abdelwahed said the summit was “very crucial” for Iraq.“This is the first time the summit has been held in Iraq since 2012 and Iraq takes it as a credit to regain its rule as a player to bridge the gap between member states of the Arab League,” he said."}
