How do you look in the mirror knowing that you\u2019re abandoning 58 hostages?\u201dThe mounting anger among families has only deepened in recent days following Netanyahu\u2019s nomination of Major General David Zini as the next head of the Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic intelligence agency.Zini has reportedly voiced opposition to any deal to bring an end to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, telling colleagues during Israeli military meetings: \u201cI oppose hostage deals. This is a forever war,\u201d according to Israel\u2019s Channel 12.\u201cThe families of the kidnapped are outraged by the words of Major General Zini. If the publication is true, these are shocking and condemnable words coming from someone who will be the one to decide the fate of the kidnapped men and women,\u201d the forum said in a statement on Friday.\u201cAppointing a Shin Bet chief who puts Netanyahu\u2019s war before the abduction of the kidnapped is tantamount to committing a crime and doing injustice to the entire people of Israel,\u201d the group said.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, says Netanyahu\u2019s new appointment \u201cwants military pressure and escalation in the war on Gaza, and that\u2019s why he was chosen\u201d.\u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of pressure on Netanyahu internationally in the last couple of weeks to try to get Israel to end the blockade of Gaza and stop the war altogether, and the expanding military operations. The military says all the brigades called up are now operating inside Gaza, she continued.\u201cFamily members say the intensified attacks will only kill the remaining captives. But Netanyahu is part of the most right-wing Israeli government in Israel\u2019s history \u2013 people who have largely been against any ceasefire deal, largely against any end to the war\u201d, she added.Netanyahu\u2019s decision to appoint Zini came just one day after Israel\u2019s Supreme Court found his attempt to fire outgoing Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar to be \u201cunlawful\u201d, citing a conflict of interest tied to Netanyahu\u2019s ongoing corruption trial.Despite the court ruling that Netanyahu could not appoint a replacement, he proceeded with the appointment of Zini anyway.The attorney general later warned that the prime minister had defied legal guidance and tainted the appointment process.The criticism comes as Netanyahu still faces an international arrest warrant request from the International Criminal Court over war crimes committed during the Gaza war."}

At least 53,822 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since October 7, 2023 and more than 122,382 others wounded \u2013 most of them women and children.Israel claims about 300 trucks have entered Gaza since Monday through the Karem Abu Salem crossing, known as Kerem Shalom to Israelis, but the UN says only a third of those deliveries have reached warehouses inside the enclave due to security constraints and chaos on the ground.The figure is far short of the more than 500 trucks that entered Gaza daily before the start of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza in October 2023.A new United States-backed delivery mechanism \u2013 run by the newly established Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) \u2013 is expected to take over aid distribution by the end of the month. Under the plan, private contractors would escort supplies to secure hubs, where civilian teams would handle distribution.But the UN has refused to participate, saying the scheme does not meet basic humanitarian standards.\u201cThe United Nations has been clear: we will not take part in any scheme that fails to respect international law and the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality,\u201d Guterres said.He stressed that the UN already has the infrastructure to respond. \u201cThe supplies \u2013 160,000 pallets, enough to fill nearly 9,000 trucks \u2013 are waiting,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is my appeal for life-saving aid for the long-suffering people of Gaza: let\u2019s do it right.

Together, they represent part of a small but increasingly visible groundswell of resistance in Israel to a war that, for a variety of reasons, many Israelis are turning their backs on.\u201cSome people are protesting because they see it as a political war,\u201d Green, who also serves as national co-director of the activist group Standing Together, said of the growing sense in Israel that the war on Gaza only serves to sustain Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing coalition.\u201cSome are tired of fighting, some want the hostages [to be released from Gaza] , and some [are protesting against] what we\u2019re doing to Palestinians. All are welcome,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou want to resist the government? You\u2019re welcome. You don\u2019t want to enlist? You\u2019re welcome. You supported the war until just recently? You\u2019re welcome.\u201dPolls in Israel show that the majority now favour a deal that would secure the release of the captives held in Gaza, even if that means an end to the war on Gaza. Nevertheless, the war has continued.\u201cI don\u2019t know if popular pressure\u2019s going to ever stop the war,\u201d said Green. \u201cI mean, its supporters have been in a minority for a year. Refusing [to answer the call up] is our most powerful weapon: no soldiers, no occupation. We need more and more people to refuse.\u201dAll the antiwar activists Al Jazeera spoke to talked of an uptick in interest in their movement following the Israeli government\u2019s unilateral decision in mid-March to collapse the ceasefire it had previously agreed to after months of negotiation.Others spoke of a dramatic increase in support when, after 11 weeks of unremitting siege on Gaza, Israel announced its latest mass ground operation in the devastated Palestinian territory on May 17, intended, according to one Israeli official, to lead to \u201cthe conquest of the Gaza Strip and the holding of the territories\u201d.Before its latest offensive, Israel called up what it said were \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of reservists to bolster its numbers in Gaza.Speaking after the announcement of the latest military attack on Gaza, Israel\u2019s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was clear in what he saw as the aims of the offensive, saying that, within months, Gaza would be \u201ctotally destroyed\u201d and what remains of its pre-war population of more than two million would be exiled to a narrow strip of land along the Egyptian border.However, despite the new offensive to recapture ground already largely destroyed by the Israeli military, dissent is gaining ground.Open letters protesting the war from military units and reservists publicly refusing to turn up for service are becoming more frequent. In April, more than a thousand of Israel\u2019s current and former pilots, generally regarded as an elite unit, wrote an open letter protesting a war they said served the \u201cpolitical and personal interests\u201d of Netanyahu, \u201cand not security ones\u201d.There are no official numbers for how many reservists have not turned up for duty. But, according to Israeli media reports, the number may be as high as 100,000. Those numbers are in addition to those refusing their initial period of mandatory military service.Most of those are \u201cgrey\u201d refusals, activists say. That is, people who gave no political reason for refusing to serve, officially refusing for other reasons, such as declining on medical grounds.But Sofia Orr, a 19-year-old from Pardes Hannah in northern Israel, is one of a growing number of conscripts refusing their mandatory service and making that refusal as public as possible.Orr refused to serve three times after first being called up on February 24, 2024. Her first and second refusals each netted her 20 days in military prison. Her third cost her 45 days.\u201cI\u2019d already decided to refuse when I was 15,\u201d Orr told Al Jazeera. \u201cI asked myself, \u2018If I go and serve in the military, what cause am I serving, does it align with my values, who am I actually helping?\u2019\u201d she said.\u201cIf I enlist, am I just entering the cycle of bloodshed that occupies and bloodily oppresses Palestinians daily?\u201d she said of defying what she described as hardwired societal expectations of Israeli life.\u201cI wanted to challenge that, so it wasn\u2019t just about refusing, but doing so as publicly and loudly as possible. I needed people to see it and know that we exist, that they could do the same, to bring Palestinian suffering into Israeli society and for Palestinians to see it and know they were not alone,\u201d she said.Orr is a member of \u201cMesarvot\u201d, an Israeli organisation that has been supporting conscientious objectors in the face of calls from prominent politicians for refusers to be arrested and prosecuted, including from cabinet member and former Israeli military spokesperson Miri Regev.\u201cThere\u2019s been a steady growth of refusers since October 7,\u201d Nimrod Flaschenberg, a political analyst and spokesperson for Mesarvot said, referring to the 2023 attack on southern Israel that led to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been seeing an exponential increase of 16-, 17-year-olds refusing to serve recently. There are around a hundred circulating an open letter, all refusing service and explaining why.\u201dOf the wider movement, Flaschenberg said, some refused to serve in a war they had come to regard as political, others because they felt it risked the lives of the captives and a minority out of revulsion for the mass killing in Gaza and the West Bank that they were being asked to participate in.\u201cThere\u2019s still an Israeli public taboo over showing any public sympathy for Palestinians,\u201d Flaschenberg said of the low prominence given to Gaza in the reasons given by most refusers, contrasting that with the widespread outrage that greeted ex-General and leader of Israel\u2019s Democrats party, Yair Golan, because he warned that Israel risked becoming regarded as a \u201cpariah state\u201d that killed Palestinian babies \u201cas a hobby\u201d if it didn\u2019t \u201creturn to sanity\u201d.\u201cThat really demonstrates the level of ignorance we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Flaschenberg said. \u201cOf course, Israel is killing babies, but Israelis just can\u2019t accept that.\u201dHowever, while growing international condemnation of Israel concentrates on vilifying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to Orr, it risks overlooking a harsher reality.\u201cFor many people here, it\u2019s Israelis who are the real victims, the first, the last and only victims in all of this,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t even see Palestinians as people, just as a threat.\u201dGreen, who immediately rejoined the protest on the Gaza border after his overnight release from house arrest was over, was equally fatalistic.\u201cI\u2019m not confident we\u2019ll succeed. The government has represented a minority of Israelis for around a year, and the war\u2019s continued,\u201d he said.But, despite that, he was not ready to give up on calling for Israelis to wake up.\u201cThings are already bad enough,\u201d Green added. \u201cWe\u2019ve destroyed nearly every building in Gaza, we\u2019ve killed 18,000 babies, and about 53,000 people. This is something we\u2019re going to have to live with.\u201d\u201cDo we really want to live with any more?\u201d"}

Her injunction is set to last for approximately two weeks, and she set hearing dates on May 27 and 29.Friday\u2019s lawsuit against the Trump administration is Harvard\u2019s second in less than two months.The latest is a response to a decision on Thursday announced by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Her department oversees the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, and she said she is revoking Harvard\u2019s privilege to use the system based on its failure to address Trump administration concerns.\u201cThis administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,\u201d she wrote on social media.The revocation means that Harvard can no longer accept foreign students. Those already enrolled will need to transfer to another school.The move represents a major escalation in Trump\u2019s pressure campaign against Harvard and other top US universities. He has accused schools of allowing anti-Semitism to fester, promoting \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d diversity programmes, and pushing ideological slants.But in Friday\u2019s lawsuit, Harvard called the Trump administration\u2019s actions a \u201cblatant violation\u201d of the US Constitution and other federal laws.Barring the prestigious Ivy League school from enrolling its international students would have an \u201cimmediate and devastating effect\u201d on the university and the more than 7,000 visa holders in its student body, it argued.\u201cWith the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard\u2019s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cWithout its international students, Harvard is not Harvard.\u201dTrump\u2019s current battle against higher education can be largely traced back to the pro-Palestine protests that broke out on US campuses last year, in response to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Trump made cracking down on the antiwar protests a centrepiece of his 2024 re-election campaign.While there have been instances of harassment from participants on both sides of the issue, protest organisers have rejected claims of widespread anti-Jewish sentiment. Some campus protests have even been spearheaded by Jewish students and organisations, including Jewish Voice for Peace.Earlier this year, task forces at Harvard itself issued two reports, warning about instances of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias, as well as anti-Semitism.Harvard has said it is working to address these concerns. Nevertheless, in April, Harvard became the latest school to receive a list of demands from the Trump administration.The list included reforming its hiring and admissions practices, refusing to admit students deemed \u201chostile to the American values and institutions\u201d, doing away with diversity programmes, and auditing academic programmes and centres, including several related to the Middle East.Harvard rejected the demands and immediately faced a freeze in $2.2bn in multi-year grants and $60m in multi-year contracts. Several federal agencies have since frozen tens of millions of dollars more in grants to Harvard.The university responded to Trump\u2019s funding freezes with a lawsuit in April, saying the administration was violating the First Amendment of the US Constitution with its \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d cuts.Trump has also floated revoking Harvard\u2019s tax exempt status, and in April, Noem sent a letter to Harvard first threatening to revoke its Student and Exchange Visitor Program approval if administrators did not send information on any foreign students\u2019 \u201cillegal and violent activities\u201d.At the end of April, Harvard said it had provided all legally required information, without providing further details.Friday\u2019s lawsuit seeks immediate relief from the Trump administration\u2019s decision to de-certify Harvard\u2019s ability to register foreign students, citing \u201cirreparable harm inflicted by this lawless action\u201d.In response to the complaint, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson accused the school of doing too little to address the Trump administration\u2019s concerns.\u201cIf only Harvard cared this much about ending the scourge of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators on their campus, they wouldn\u2019t be in this situation to begin with,\u201d Jackson said.\u201cHarvard should spend their time and resources on creating a safe campus environment instead of filing frivolous lawsuits,\u201d she added.In a letter to the Harvard community, school President Alan Garber framed Trump\u2019s attack on Harvard\u2019s foreign student body as part of \u201ca series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence\u201d.Garber described the de-certification as evidence of the \u201cfederal government\u2019s illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body\u201d.In its complaint, Harvard said the de-certification has thrown \u201ccountless\u201d academic programmes, clinics, courses and research laboratories into disarray.Harvard enrolled nearly 6,800 international students in its current school year, equal to 27 percent of its total enrolment.On Thursday, Noem also said Harvard could avoid the move if it turned over more information on foreign students, including video or audio of their protest activity over the past five years.Harvard has maintained it has already met the legal requirements in its disclosures."}

Since Monday\u2019s announcement, only 300 trucks have made it in, including Thursday\u2019s convoy, according to COGAT.Aid agencies also state that even the aid that is being allowed into Gaza is not reaching people.\u201cSignificant challenges in loading and dispatching goods remain due to insecurity, the risk of looting, delays in coordination approvals and inappropriate routes being provided by Israeli forces that are not viable for the movement of cargo,\u201d the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said.Hamas officials said on Friday that Israeli air strikes had killed at least six Palestinians guarding aid trucks against looters.An umbrella network of Palestinian aid groups said that just 119 aid trucks have entered Gaza since Israel eased its blockade on Monday, and that distribution has been hampered by looting, including by armed groups of men.\u201cThey stole food meant for children and families suffering from severe hunger,\u201d the network said in a statement.The UN\u2019s World Food Programme said on Friday that 15 of its trucks were looted in southern Gaza while en route to WFP-supported bakeries.Inside Gaza, the situation continues to deteriorate.Dr Ahmed al-Farrah of Nasser Hospital told Al Jazeera that the health system is overwhelmed.\u201cMost people now live off food scraps of what they had in stock,\u201d he said. \u201cI predict there will be many victims because of food insecurity.\u201dPalestinian Health Ministry officials said on Thursday that at least 29 children and elderly people have died in recent days from starvation-related causes, with thousands more at risk.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019s  spokesperson said aid is being distributed via UN mechanisms, but stressed the amount reaching Gaza \u201cis not enough\u201d.The leaders of Britain, France and Canada warned Israel on Monday their countries would take action, including possible sanctions, if Israel did not lift aid restrictions.\u201cThe Israeli Government\u2019s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable and risks breaching International Humanitarian Law,\u201d a joint statement released by the British government said.\u201cWe will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions,\u201d it added.In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office accused the trio of being \u201con the wrong side of history\u201d and \u201csupporting \u201cmass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers\u201d."}

Students already at Harvard on these visas will be required to transfer to another school if they want to remain in the US legally.Noem accused the university of \u201cfostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party\u201d.In an earlier letter on April 16, the DHS had threatened to revoke Harvard\u2019s eligibility to enrol international students unless it submits information on international students\u2019 disciplinary records and protest participation.Tensions have been mounting with Harvard since student protests against Israel\u2019s war on Gaza swept campuses last year.The Trump administration accused Harvard of creating an \u201cunsafe and hostile\u201d campus, specifically citing antisemitic incidents and a failure to curb \u201cpro-Hamas activism\u201d. Officials also criticised the university\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies as discriminatory, and raised suspicions over alleged ties to Chinese institutions, though no direct evidence has been made public.In April, the Trump administration froze nearly $2.3bn in federal funding to Harvard over what it claimed was its failure to tackle rampant anti-Semitism on campus.The administration announced the freeze after Harvard rejected a series of demands that it said would subject the university to undue government control, including that it accede to external audits of faculty and students to ensure \u201cviewpoint diversity\u201d. The DHS also demanded detailed records on international students, including any disciplinary actions and potential security concerns.In May, US Education Department Secretary Linda McMahon wrote to Harvard, saying the elite university had made a \u201cmockery\u201d of higher education and should no longer seek federal grants, \u201csince none will be provided\u201d.\u201cHarvard will cease to be a publicly funded institution, and can instead operate as a privately-funded institution, drawing on its colossal endowment, and raising money from its large base of wealthy alumni,\u201d McMahon wrote in the letter.Thursday\u2019s decision to revoke Harvard\u2019s SEVP certification is widely viewed as retaliation for the university\u2019s refusal to fully comply with the federal requests. It is unclear if the Trump administration will reinstate Harvard\u2019s SEVP certification if the university provides the requested information now.The US government has two main ways of barring a university from enrolling international students.First, it can revoke the school\u2019s SEVP certification which allows schools to accept foreign students. Without it, Harvard can no longer issue the Form I-20 document that students need to apply for F-1 or J-1 student visas. This is the step the government took on Thursday.Second, the government can deny student visas outright. The US Department of State reviews visa applications, and if a student says they\u2019re planning to attend a school that doesn\u2019t have SEVP certification \u2013 like Harvard now \u2013 their visa can be denied. That means students would not be allowed to enter the US to study at Harvard, even if they have already been accepted.The move to block enrolment of overseas students affects approximately 6,800 foreign students currently studying at Harvard, constituting about 27 percent of the total student body. These students must now find places to study at other universities in the US or risk having the leave the country.Overseas students at Harvard came from 146 countries as of September 2024. Students from China, Canada and India made up the largest number, collectively accounting for 40 percent of the international cohort.The number of foreign students at the university has risen by 26.75 percent over the past four years.F-1 students usually have 60 days, and J-1 students 30 days, to leave the US after completing their studies. However, if their student status is terminated due to a violation, they may have to leave immediately. In Harvard\u2019s case, it\u2019s unclear how much time international students will be given to transfer or depart.Most international students at Harvard pay full tuition, which is $59,320 for the 2024-25 academic year, either by making direct payments or via scholarships. Room and Board and other mandatory fees amount to an additional $27,606 per student. That makes a total of $86,926 per year.Precise revenue figures for Harvard are not publicly disclosed, but if all 6,800 foreign students are paying full tuition fees and extras, that would amount to just over $591m in annual revenues.International students also have a broader economic impact in the US. They contributed approximately $43.8bn to the US economy during the 2023 \u2013 2024 academic year through tuition and fees and living expenses, according to the NAFSA Association of International Educators.States with the largest economic activity derived from international students were California, New York, Massachusetts, Texas and Illinois.Harvard has pushed back against the DHS decision, calling the move both \u201cunlawful\u201d and \u201cdeeply damaging\u201d to its academic mission.In a public statement, the school said it is fully committed to supporting its global community. \u201cHarvard remains dedicated to supporting our international students and scholars, who contribute immensely to our learning environment,\u201d the statement said.The university\u2019s legal team is reportedly reviewing the implications of the government\u2019s actions and preparing for a possible lawsuit if the certification is not reinstated.In the meantime, Harvard has set up dedicated advisory resources to help students understand their rights and explore transfer options."}

Both were pronounced dead at the scene.Israeli embassy staff have said that the young couple were set to be engaged in the coming days.\u201cA young couple \u2014 at the beginning of their life\u2019s journey, about to be engaged, in another country \u2014 had their bodies removed in the cold of the night, in a foreign city, in a body bag. We are not going to tolerate that anymore,\u201d said Pirro, appearing to allude primarily to Lischinsky\u2019s foreign roots.\u201cThis is the kind of case that picks at old sores and old scars, because these kinds of cases remind us of what has happened in the past that we can never and must never forget.\u201dShe pointed out that the Wednesday night attack took place at a museum that includes one of Washington\u2019s oldest synagogues in the centre of the city.Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said that the suspect chanted, \u201cFree Palestine! Free Palestine!\u201d after the shooting. Rodriguez, who hailed from Chicago, appears to have identified himself to police and was arrested shortly after the shooting.An affidavit from the Federal Bureau of Investigation notes that Rodriguez told police, \u201cI did it for Palestine. I did it for Gaza.\u201dThe shooting, which has been widely condemned, comes as Israel faces growing global anger over its war on Gaza, where a blockade has left millions of Palestinians without food or basic supplies.Experts at human rights organisations and the United Nations have compared the war, which has killed at least 53,000 people, to ethnic cleansing and genocide.Since the war began on October 7, 2023, Jewish, Muslim and Arab communities have all reported upticks in harassment and racism.In the aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s shooting, officials spoke out against anti-Semitism, and the administration of President Donald Trump promised to pursue every legal avenue against the suspect.\u201cThe Department of Justice will be prosecuting the perpetrator responsible for this to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday. \u201cHatred has no place in the United States of America under President Donald Trump.\u201dShe went on to compare antiwar protests at US universities, which have been largely peaceful, to \u201c\u200aanti-Semitic illegal behaviour\u201d. Protest leaders, however, have largely disavowed anti-Jewish hate.In the wake of the shooting, one US Congress member told Fox News that the \u201cPalestinian cause\u201d was \u201cevil\u201d. Republican Representative Randy Fine continued by suggesting the Gaza war should end like World War II did, with the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.\u201cWe nuked the Japanese twice in order to get unconditional surrender,\u201d he said. \u201cThat needs to be the same here. There is something deeply, deeply wrong with this culture, and it needs to be defeated.\u201dSeparately, the Israeli government denounced the shooting as an attack against its state.\u201cWe are witness to the terrible cost of the antisemitism and wild incitement against the State of Israel,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement."}

He accuses Harvard of \u201cpushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting \u2018Sickness\u2019\u201d.April 16, 2025: The Department of Homeland Security calls on Harvard to turn over records on any foreign students\u2019 \u201cillegal and violent activities\u201d, while threatening to revoke the university\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor Program approval. The certification is required for it to enrol foreign students.

No action is immediately taken.May 5, 2025: The Trump administration says it is cutting all new federal grants to Harvard.May 13, 2025: The US Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announces another $450m in federal funding from eight federal agencies.May 19, 2025: The DOJ announces it will use the False Claims Act, typically used to punish federal funding recipients accused of corruption, to crack down on universities like Harvard over DEI policies. The Department of Health and Human Services also says it is terminating $60m in federal grants to Harvard.May 22, 2025: Noem announces revocation of Harvard\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor Program, blocking it from enrolling new foreign students and saying current students will need to transfer to continue their studies.Harvard responds: \u201cWe are fully committed to maintaining Harvard\u2019s ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the university \u2013 and this nation \u2013 immeasurably.\u201d"}
{"website": "aljazeera", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/22/israeli-speculation-mounts-over-potential-rift-between-trump-and-netanyahu", "title": "Israeli speculation mounts over potential rift between Trump and Netanyahu", "date": "22 May 2025", "media_type": "news", "link": null, "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has often tried to paint himself as a close friend of United States President Donald Trump, but the relationship has rarely been as straightforward as the Israeli premier has portrayed it.And recently, speculation across the Israeli media that the relationship between the two leaders, and by extension, their countries, has begun to unravel is becoming unavoidable.Some idea of the gap was apparent in Trump\u2019s recent Middle East trip, which saw him visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates but not Israel, the state that has typically been the US\u2019s closest ally within the region.Likewise, US negotiations with two of Israel\u2019s fiercest regional opponents, Iran and the Houthi rebels in Yemen, have been taking place without any apparent input from Israel, a country that has always regarded itself as central to such matters. Lastly, against a growing chorus of international condemnation over Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, there was the decision of US Vice President JD Vance to cancel a planned visit to Israel for apparently \u201clogistical\u201d reasons.Appearing on national television earlier this month, Israeli commentator Dana Fahn Luzon put it succinctly: \u201cTrump is signalling to Netanyahu, \u2018Honey, I\u2019ve had enough of you.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a total breakdown of everything that might be of benefit to Israel,\u201d Mitchell Barak, an Israeli pollster and former political aide to several senior Israeli political figures, including Netanyahu, told Al Jazeera. \u201cAmerica was once our closest ally; now we don\u2019t seem to have a seat at the table. This should be of concern to every single Israeli.\u201d\u2018Many Israelis blame Netanyahu for this,\u201d Barak continued. \u201cHe always presented Trump as somehow being in his pocket, and it\u2019s pretty clear Trump didn\u2019t like that. Netanyahu crossed a line.\u201dWhile concern over a potential rift may be growing within Israel, prominent voices in the US administration are stressing the strength of their alliance.Last Sunday, President Trump\u2019s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said that, while the US was keen to avert what he called a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d in Gaza, he didn\u2019t think there was \u201cany daylight between President Trump\u2019s position and Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s position\u201d.Also doubling down on the US\u2019s commitment to Israel was White House National Security Council spokesperson James Hewitt, who dismissed reports that the Trump administration was preparing to \u201cabandon\u201d Israel if it continues with its war on Gaza, telling Israeli media that \u201cIsrael has had no better friend in its history than President Trump\u201d.The Trump administration has also been active in shutting down criticism of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza in public spheres and specifically on US college campuses.Several international students have also been arrested and deported for their support of Palestine, including Rumeysa Ozturk, whose arrest as she was walking on a street in a Boston suburb for an opinion piece co-authored in a student newspaper was described by Human Rights Watch as \u201cchilling\u201d.Those policies have made it clear that the Trump administration sits firmly in Israel\u2019s corner. And looking back at Trump\u2019s policies in his first presidential term, that is not surprising.Trump fulfilled many of the Israeli right\u2019s dreams in that term, between 2017 and 2021, including recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, despite its eastern half being occupied Palestinian territory, recognising the annexation of the Golan Heights, despite it being occupied Syrian territory, and pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal.But those actions are partly to blame for the bumpy relationship between Trump and Netanyahu, with the US president reportedly resentful of what he saw as a lack of gratitude for those pro-Israel policies.Trump was also furious after Netanyahu congratulated former US President Joe Biden following his 2020 election victory over Trump, which the current president still disputes.\u201cThe first person that congratulated [Biden] was Bibi [Benjamin] Netanyahu, the man that I did more for than any other person I dealt with. \u2026 Bibi could have stayed quiet. He has made a terrible mistake,\u201d Trump said in an interview in 2021.Nevertheless, in the build-up to the 2024 US election, Netanyahu and his allies actively courted candidate Trump, believing him to be the best means of fulfilling their agenda and continuing their war on Gaza, analysts said.\u201cNetanyahu had really campaigned for Trump before the election, emphasising how bad Biden was,\u201d Yossi Mekelberg, an Associate Fellow at Chatham House, said.\u201cNow they don\u2019t know which way Trump\u2019s going to go because he\u2019s so contractual. He\u2019s all about the win,\u201d Mekelberg added, referring to the series of victories the president claimed during his recent Gulf tour, adding, \u201cbut there\u2019s no win in Palestine\u201d.Across the Israeli press and media, a consensus is taking hold that Trump has simply tired of trying to secure a \u201cwin\u201d or an end to the war on Gaza that Netanyahu and his allies on the Israeli hard right have no interest in pursuing.Israeli Army Radio has even carried reports that Trump has blocked direct contact from Netanyahu over concerns that the Israeli prime minister may be trying to manipulate him.Quoting an unnamed Israeli official, Yanir Cozin, a reporter with Israeli Army Radio, wrote on X: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing Trump hates more than being portrayed as a sucker and someone being played, so he decided to cut off contact.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a sense in Israel that Trump\u2019s turned on Netanyahu,\u201d political analyst Nimrod Flaschenberg said from Tel Aviv. \u201cSupporters of Netanyahu are panicking, as they all previously thought that Trump\u2019s backing was unlimited.\u201dA break in relations between Netanyahu and Trump might not mean an automatic break between Israel and the US, Flaschenberg cautioned, with all factions across the Israeli political spectrum speculating on what the future may hold under a realigned relationship with the US.US financial, military and diplomatic support for Israel has been a bedrock of both countries\u2019 foreign policy for decades, Mekelberg said. Moreover, whatever Trump\u2019s current misgivings about his relationship with Netanyahu, support for Israel, while diminishing, remains hardwired into much of his Republican base, analysts and polls have noted, and particularly among Republican \u2013 and Democratic \u2013 donors.\u201cThose opposed to Netanyahu and the war are hoping that the US may now apply a lasting ceasefire,\u201d Flaschenberg said, with reference to Israeli reliance upon US patronage. \u201cThat\u2019s not because of any great faith in Trump, but more the extent of their dismay in the current government.\u201dHowever, equally present are those on the hard right, such as Israel\u2019s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who Mekelberg speculated may also hope to take advantage of whatever direction US policy towards Israel heads in.\u201cBen-Gvir, Smotrich and their backers could take advantage of American disinterest, depending upon what shape it takes,\u201d Mekelberg told Al Jazeera. \u201cIf the US continues to provide weapons and diplomatic cover in the UN while letting [Israel] get on with it, then that\u2019s their dream,\u201d he said of Smotrich, who has reassured his backers that allowing minimal aid into the besieged enclave did not mean that Israel would stop \u201cdestroying everything that\u2019s left of the Gaza Strip\u201d.However, where Netanyahu may figure in this is uncertain.Accusations that the Israeli prime minister has become reliant upon the war to sustain the political coalition he needs to remain in office and avoid both a legal reckoning in his corruption trial, as well as a political reckoning over his government\u2019s failures ahead of the October 7, 2023 attack, are both widespread and longstanding.\u201cI don\u2019t know if Netanyahu can come back from this,\u201d Barak said, still uncertain about whether the prime minister can demonstrate his survival skills once again. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Netanyahu being at the end of his line. I don\u2019t know. They\u2019ve been saying that for years, and he\u2019s still here. They were saying that when I was his aide, but I can\u2019t see any more magic tricks that are available to him.\u201d"}

It refused.\u201dIn a letter to the university\u2019s administration, Noem said the university\u2019s Student Exchange Visitor Program certification has been revoked. The programme is overseen by the US Homeland Security Investigations unit, which falls under the agency Noem leads.The move means that not only will Harvard not be able to accept foreign students on its campus, but current students will need to \u201ctransfer to another university in order to maintain their non-immigrant status\u201d, the letter said.In a statement, Harvard called the move \u201cunlawful\u201d and a \u201cretaliatory action\u201d.\u201cWe are fully committed to maintaining Harvard\u2019s ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the university \u2013 and this nation \u2013 immeasurably,\u201d the university said.The action marks an escalation amid a wider standoff between the university \u2013 which has refused to agree to a list of demands related to its diversity programmes and response to pro-Palestine protests \u2013 and the Trump administration.The administration has responded with three rounds of federal funding and grant cuts, totalling more than $2.6bn. The most recent was on Monday. Harvard is currently pursuing a lawsuit accusing the administration of defying the US Constitution in its actions.Earlier this week, Harvard President Alan Garber called on alumni to throw their support \u2013 and donations \u2013 behind the university.\u201cThe institution entrusted to us now faces challenges unlike any others in our long history,\u201d Garber wrote in an email, in which he launched the Presidential Priorities Fund and the Presidential Fund for Research. Both funds are meant to address gaps left by the funding cuts.According to immigration lawyer Leon Fresco, the move by the Trump administration would be a financial blow for the school and a \u201cmajor problem\u201d for the students.\u201cIf the foreign students cannot attend the university, they get their tuition payments back that they\u2019ve already paid to the university for this upcoming semester,\u201d he told Al Jazeera, adding that Harvard was relying on that money for the coming year.Fresco noted that there is a clear legal recourse to fight against the revocation of its foreign exchange programme.\u201cThe revocation regulation is very specific \u2013 there has to be a notice of intention to revoke that is given. There has to be reasons related to non-compliance with the student exchange visitor program,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a politically ideologically based revocation, that doesn\u2019t exist in the regulations.\u201dNoem, in April, first threatened to revoke Harvard\u2019s Student Exchange Visitor Program certification, which is required by educational institutions to host students on several visa types.She gave the university administration an April 30 deadline to provide detailed records on what she called the \u201cillegal and violent activities\u201d of foreign students on campus, pointing to a federal law that requires disclosures of academics, enrolment and disciplinary action.The university later said it had provided the requested information to the agency, the Harvard Crimson reported, although it did not reveal further details.The threat came amid a wider crackdown by the Trump administration on pro-Palestine protests at universities across the US, which federal officials have broadly portrayed as \u201canti-Semitic\u201d, a label rejected by organisers,  Al Jazeera\u2019s Kimberly Halkett reported.\u201cThe Trump administration has been clamping down hard on Harvard and other colleges, including Columbia University, over what the administration says is \u2018anti-Semitism\u2019 that exists on the campuses, and that really seems to be the spark that kind of ignited this,\u201d Halkett reported from Washington, DC.\u201cThe president put in place a joint task force at the start of his administration to address this, but opponents say this task force evolved to include everything from clamping down on hiring practices to curriculum changes at universities,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump himself has accused universities of fomenting \u2018anti-Trump\u2019 ideology.\u201dThere were 7,417 total schools approved for the Student Exchange Visitor Program in the US in 2023, according to federal data. The agency maintains that under federal law, it can review approved schools at any time."}

The violations in question, Van Der Hout said, include the lack of a warrant at the time of the arrest and claims that Khalil proved to be a flight risk.The hearing could be the most consequential turn yet in a series of cases in which US students have challenged being targeted by the Trump administration for their pro-Palestine advocacy or statements. It comes after three other students \u2013 Rumeysa Ozturk, Mohsen Mahdawi, and Badar Khan Suri \u2013 successfully challenged their detentions.Ozturk, Mahdawi, and Khan Suri have since been ordered released on bail as their parallel challenges in federal court and their deportation cases in immigration court proceed. Lawyers for the students say their rights, including freedom of speech, have been violated by the Trump administration.Despite Khalil also challenging his arrest in a federal case in New Jersey, a judge there has yet to make a ruling on whether he should be released. He has remained in detention in Louisiana.Khalil\u2019s lawyers have accused the Trump administration of trying to slow roll his federal challenge to his arrest and detention, while fast-tracking the immigration proceedings. Judges in immigration courts, which fall under the executive branch, are typically viewed as less independent than life-tenured federal district judges.\u201cThe bigger picture is that the government would like to slow down Mahmoud\u2019s habeas corpus case in federal court before an independent judge who has life tenure,\u201d Ramzi Kassem, a lawyer with the City University of New York\u2019s Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility (CLEAR) project, told reporters.\u201cAnd they\u2019d like to accelerate as much as possible these immigration proceedings, as they have so far, in front of a government employee who is subject to government pressure,\u201d he said.Immigration Judge Jamee Comans had previously sided with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s claim that Khalil is deportable under an obscure provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act because his presence in the US poses \u201cadverse foreign policy consequences\u201d.Rubio has broadly portrayed Khalil\u2019s involvement in pro-Palestine protests at Columbia University as \u201canti-Semitic\u201d, but has not provided any further evidence to the court supporting the claim.Khalil and his legal team have firmly denied that his advocacy contained any anti-Jewish sentiment, and no evidence of such conduct has emerged.Thursday\u2019s hearing not hinge on the government\u2019s motivation for targeting Khalil, but instead focus on procedural missteps by immigration agents.Those agents had initially claimed that they had a warrant to detain Khalil when they confronted him in the lobby of his Manhattan apartment building. They later admitted they did not have a warrant, but arrested Khalil because they said his actions and statements indicated he was a flight risk.Surveillance footage of the encounter contradicts that statement, Khalil\u2019s lawyers maintain.\u201cWe filed, over the last probably 48 hours, new evidence, including a video surveillance from Columbia that we got through a subpoena that clearly shows there was no attempt to flee whatsoever,\u201d Van Der Hout said.Lawyers for Khalil also separately argued that he is eligible for asylum. They say the unfounded claims made by the Trump administration that Khalil is a \u201cHamas supporter\u201d would put him at risk if he were to be deported to his birthplace of Syria, or to Algeria, where he has citizenship.Ahead of the hearing, officials from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) denied a meeting between Khalil, his wife, Noor Abdalla, and their son, who was born while Khalil remained in detention.A federal judge later ordered that Khalil must be allowed an in-person meeting with his wife, with Khalil holding his son for the first time on Thursday."}

More essential food is needed to push back the risk of famine. Bread alone is not enough for people to survive,\u201d the agency said in a post on X. The president of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), Younis al-Khatib, had earlier said many Palestinians had yet to receive any supplies so far. \u201cNo civilian has received anything yet,\u201d al-Khatib told reporters.He said most of the aid trucks are still at the Karem Abu Salem crossing, known as Kerem Shalom to Israelis, in southern Gaza.As limited deliveries enter the Strip, the Israeli military has continued to launch attacks across the enclave, with medical sources telling Al Jazeera that at least 51 Palestinians have been killed since dawn on Thursday.At least 53,655 Palestinians have been killed and more than 121,000 others injured since Israel\u2019s war on Gaza began in October 2023, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee also announced new forced evacuation orders for Palestinians in Jabalia and Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza. He said in a post on X that the army will \u201csignificantly expand its military activity\u201d in the area.Reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum said that while Palestinians have welcomed the influx of aid, it is a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d compared with the population\u2019s needs.\u201cFive hundred aid trucks are needed on a daily basis in order to avert the current food crisis in the territory,\u201d Abu Azzoum explained.Still, Gaza resident Ahmed Abed al-Daym said the aid trucks were a \u201cpositive sign\u201d amid dire conditions.\u201cOur homes are empty \u2013 there is no bread, and our children are going hungry,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\u201cIn many households, bread has completely disappeared. What people urgently need is a steady and sufficient flow of flour and other essentials. Unfortunately, the limited aid that has entered so far falls far short of meeting our needs.\u201dAnother resident, Reem Zidiah, said that due to the mass starvation that Gaza is enduring, no one is safe in the besieged enclave.\u201cAll of us here in Gaza, we don\u2019t think about tomorrow because we don\u2019t know what will happen tomorrow \u2013 whether we\u2019re going to live or die,\u201d Zidiah told Al Jazeera.Meanwhile, Action Against Hunger teams on the ground in southern Gaza warned that there was less than a seven-days\u2019 supply of food to prevent acute malnutrition in children.Natalia Anguera, the humanitarian group\u2019s head of Middle East operations, said \u201cflour has come in and some bakeries in the south have resumed operations\u201d.However, she stressed that \u201cspecific nutritional supplies reserves for children under five are about to run out\u201d."}

At least 53,655 have been killed since Israel launched its assault on Gaza in October 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities."}

On Thursday, he appeared in court in Washington, DC, for his arraignment. A preliminary hearing has been set for June 18. Rodriguez is the only suspect.President Donald Trump condemned the shooting as \u201chorrible\u201d, stating there was no place for \u201chatred\u201d in the US. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by what had unfolded in the US capital.\u201cThis is a despicable act of hatred, of anti-Semitism, which has claimed the lives of two young employees of the Israeli embassy,\u201d he said.Kristi Noem, secretary of Homeland Security, said federal authorities were investigating the incident and would bring its \u201cdepraved perpetrator\u201d to justice. Jeanine Pirro, the interim US attorney for Washington, DC, said the killings were being investigated as a \u201chate crime and a crime of terrorism\u201d.Here is what we know so far:Officers responded to multiple calls about a shooting near the Capital Jewish Museum at about 9pm on Wednesday (01:00 GMT Thursday).The victims, a man and a woman, were leaving an event at the museum, which is in the area of 3rd and F streets in Northwest, Washington, DC, close to an FBI field office and the US attorney general\u2019s office, when the suspect approached a group of four people and opened fire, Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said at a news conference.First responders found the victims unconscious and not breathing. Despite life-saving efforts, both were pronounced dead.According to police, the suspect entered the museum after the shooting and was detained by security personnel at the event.\u201cOnce in handcuffs, the suspect identified where he discarded the weapon, and that weapon has been recovered, and he implied that he committed the offence,\u201d Smith said.The two were named by the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim.Lischinsky was Israeli. A German diplomatic source told the AFP news agency that Lischinsky also held a German passport.Milgrim was an American citizen. Both worked at the Israeli embassy.The Israeli ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, told reporters the young staffers were a couple \u201cabout to be engaged\u201d.\u201cThe young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem,\u201d Leiter revealed.The suspect has been identified as 31-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, Illinois. Following his arrest, his home was searched by police.Rodriguez has been charged with two counts of murder, causing death with a firearm and discharging a firearm in a crime of violence.Jeanine Pirro, the interim US Attorney who was recently appointed by President Donald Trump as federal prosecutor in Washington, told reporters the charges against Ridriguez constitute a \u201cdeath penalty-eligible case\u201d.\u201cWe are going to continue to investigate this as a hate crime and as a crime of terrorism,\u201d Pirro said.Reporting from close to the site of the shooting, Al Jazeera\u2019s Heidi Zhou-Castro said the suspect was not previously on the radar of local authorities.\u201cHe was not a known entity. There was no heightened alert prior to this happening,\u201d she said.So far, the police have not confirmed any motive.Speaking on Thursday, Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, blamed a \u201ctoxic anti-Semitic incitement against Israel and Jews around the world\u201d since the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023.When the suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was taken into custody, he began chanting: \u201cFree, free Palestine,\u201d Police Chief Smith said.Mohamad Elmasry, professor of media studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, said the attacks were \u201cawful\u201d and were rightfully being condemned regardless of political ideology.He said: \u201cYou have the Trump administration, Israel and some of their supporters coming out and saying that this is an act of anti-Semitism \u2026 and that could be the case, that it is just an act of naked anti-Jewish hatred, which obviously should be condemned,\u201d Elmasry told Al Jazeera.\u201cBut it\u2019s also possible that Mr Rodriguez carried this act of vigilante violence out against the State of Israel, or that he\u2019s taking out his frustrations over the genocide [in Gaza] or Israel\u2019s apartheid policies, on these embassy staffers. That\u2019s an important distinction, because if that\u2019s the motive, then it requires a different course of action.\u201d\u201cThese horrible DC killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW!\u201d President Trump posted on social media early Thursday.\u201cHatred and radicalism have no place in the USA. Condolences to the families of the victims. So sad that such things as this can happen! God bless you all!\u201dLater, Trump\u2019s Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated the president\u2019s outrage and warned of dire consequences.\u201cThe evil of anti-Semitism must be eradicated from our society,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Department of Justice will be prosecuting the perpetrator responsible for this to the fullest extent of the law.\u201dShe also tied the shooting to Trump\u2019s crackdown on anti-Semitism, which has largely focused on antiwar student protesters demonstrating against Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.\u201cSecretary of State Marco Rubio has revoked thousands of student visas from campuses where these pro-Hamas terrorist campus agitators and violent protests took place,\u201d Leavitt explained.\u201cWe\u2019ve also withheld funding from those varied campuses as well in an effort to combat anti-Semitism. So the president has made it very clear that such hatred will have no place in our country.\u201dIsraeli officials also strongly condemned the incident, describing it as a \u201cdespicable act of hatred\u201d. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after the shooting: \u201cWe are witnessing the terrible price of anti-Semitism and the wild incitement against the State of Israel.\u201cI have instructed to enhance security arrangements at Israeli missions around the world and to increase protection for state representatives,\u201d Netanyahu said.On Thursday, reactions and condolences poured in from other countries as well.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called the shooting a \u201cheinous act\u201d in a post on X, adding that at the moment \u201cwe must assume there was an anti-Semitic motive\u201d.Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, said: \u201cShocked by the shooting of two Israeli embassy staff in Washington DC. There is and should be no place in our societies for hatred, extremism, or antisemitism. I extend my condolences to the families of the victims and the people of Israel.\u201dIn the United Kingdom, Foreign Secretary of State David Lammy said: \u201cHorrified by the killing of two Israeli Embassy staff in DC. We condemn this appalling, antisemitic crime. Our thoughts are with the victims, their families and colleagues at this awful time.\u201dFrance\u2019s foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: \u201cThe murder of two members of the Israeli embassy near the Jewish Museum in Washington is an abhorrent act of antisemitic barbarity. Nothing can justify such violence. My thoughts go to their loved ones, their colleagues, and the State of Israel.\u201dIn Ireland, the prime minister, Micheal Martin, said: \u201cI strongly condemn the horrific gun attack that killed two Israeli embassy staff in Washington DC last night. My deepest sympathies go to the family and friends of the couple, and the Israeli people. There can be absolutely no place for violence or hate.\u201dAntonio Tajani, the Italian foreign minister, said: \u201cI stand with the State of Israel for the tragic murder of two young employees of the Israeli embassy in Washington. Scenes of terror and violence to be strongly condemned. antisemitism born of hatred against Jews must be stopped, the horrors of the past can never return.\u201dOn Thursday, federal prosecutors announced an opening volley of charges against the suspect, Rodriguez, with promises to potentially unveil more.Rodriguez was charged with first-degree murder, murdering foreign officials, causing death with a firearm and discharging a firearm in a crime of violence.Pirro, a former Fox News host whom Trump only recently appointed as the interim US attorney for the District of Columbia, said that Rodriguez could face further charges in coming days.\u201cThis is a horrific crime, and these crimes are not going to be tolerated by me and by this office,\u201d Pirro said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to investigate this as a hate crime and a crime of terrorism, and we will add additional charges as the evidence warrants.\u201dInvestigations continue into Rodriguez\u2019s background and motives. Police cordoned off his home in Chicago, Illinois, as their probe continues.Police Chief Smith said law enforcement did not believe there was an ongoing threat to the community at present.FBI Director Kash Patel said he and his team had been briefed on the shooting.\u201cWhile we\u2019re working with [the Metropolitan Police Department] to respond and learn more, in the immediate, please pray for the victims and their families,\u201d he wrote on X.Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters her administration would not tolerate \u201cviolence or hate in our city\u201d.\u201cWe will not tolerate any acts of terrorism, and we\u2019re going to stand together as a community in the coming days and weeks to send a clear message that we will not tolerate anti-Semitism,\u201d Bowser said.Across the Atlantic, in France, the country\u2019s interior minister told police to \u201cstep up surveillance at sites linked to the Jewish community\u201d. Security measures must be \u201cvisible and dissuasive\u201d, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said in a message seen by AFP news agency.Saar said that Israeli flags at the ministry headquarters and at missions around the world would be flown at half-mast on Thursday.The shooting comes as Israel has launched a new military campaign in Gaza to control all of the Strip while continuing to impose an 11-week aid blockade that has been widely condemned.Many world leaders, including allies, have demanded that Israel end the war and let aid into the war-ravaged territory or face punitive actions."}

It\u2019s totally unacceptable, it\u2019s some of many things that are totally unacceptable that\u2019s going on in the region.We demand the launch of a full investigation so that similar incidents do not happen again.Today\u2019s events in Jenin are unacceptable. I have spoken to our diplomats who were affected. Civilians must always be protected, and diplomats allowed to do their jobs.

Fortunately, he is fine. These diplomats were on an official visit to Jenin, coordinated with the Israeli army, in a convoy of 20 clearly recognisable vehicles. Belgium is asking Israel for a convincing explanation.I condemn the attacks by [the Israeli military] against a group of diplomats in Jenin today. Diplomatic and consular staff enjoy a special status under international law and must be protected. These actions constitute a clear violation of international law and are deeply unacceptable.Portugal condemns the attack by the Israeli army on the diplomatic delegation in the Jenin refugee camp, West Bank. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs \u2026 expressed its solidarity with the Portuguese ambassador who was part of the delegation and will take the appropriate diplomatic measures.The Federal Foreign Office strongly condemns this unprovoked fire. We can count ourselves lucky that nothing more serious occurred.The group was travelling in the West Bank in the course of its diplomatic work and in coordination with the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli army. The role of diplomats as independent observers on the ground is indispensable and in no way represents a threat to Israeli security interests.The Israeli government must immediately investigate the circumstances and respect the inviolability of diplomats.Slovenia joins EU partners in condemning the gunfire that threatened foreign diplomats at Jenin camp.Such intimidation violates the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations and is utterly unacceptable. We expect a prompt, transparent Israeli investigation, full accountability and guarantees of safe, unhindered access for all diplomatic missions.This is a clear violation of international law and international humanitarian law, and a crime that contravenes all diplomatic norms.The Ministry\u2019s official spokesperson, Ambassador Dr Sufyan Qudah, affirmed the kingdom\u2019s absolute rejection and strong condemnation of this targeting, which constitutes a violation of diplomatic agreements and norms, particularly the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which defines the procedures and controls governing diplomatic work and grants immunities to diplomatic missions.The state of Qatar strongly condemns the Israeli occupation forces for opening fire on an international diplomatic delegation during its visit to the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, and considered as a violation of international laws, conventions, and diplomatic norms.We condemn in the strongest terms the opening of fire by Israeli soldiers on a group of diplomats, including an official from the Turkish Consulate General in Jerusalem, during their visit to the city of Jenin.This attack, which endangered the lives of diplomats, is yet another demonstration of Israel\u2019s systematic disregard for international law and human rights. The targeting of diplomats constitutes a grave threat not only to individual safety but also to the mutual respect and trust that form the foundation of inter-state relations.The Arab Republic of Egypt emphasises its absolute rejection of this incident, which violates all diplomatic norms, and calls upon the Israeli side to provide the necessary clarifications regarding the circumstances of this incident.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has summoned the Israeli ambassador in Montevideo to clarify the incident.Uruguay urges the Israeli government to investigate this incident and take the necessary measures to ensure the protection and allow the operations of diplomatic personnel accredited to the State of Palestine.The Israeli military justified the action by stating that the diplomatic delegation had invaded an \u2018unauthorised area\u2019. However, there is no record of this occurring or of any officer approaching the delegation to verbally warn them in a timely manner.What happened violates the provisions of Article 29 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which establishes the inviolability of diplomatic agents. All States Parties to the aforementioned Convention, including Israel, are obliged to respect it.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will request the Israeli embassy in Mexico to provide the clarifications warranted by the case."}

This is the first time Trump\u2019s plan has been mentioned by Netanyahu as one of the conditions to halt fighting. Multiple nations and rights groups have called the plan ethnic cleansing.Netanyahu said Israel should avoid a \u201chumanitarian crisis to preserve our freedom of operational action\u201d, referring to Israel\u2019s decision to allow a very limited number of humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza. He also referenced a much-criticised plan \u201cdeveloped with the US\u201d to distribute food in the enclave without Hamas taking control of it. The Palestinian group denies it takes aid. Israel has come under international pressure to halt its punishing total blockade on Gaza, which had prevented any food or aid trucks from entering the territory since March 2.That has exacerbated the already dire humanitarian catastrophe inside the enclave. A United Nations-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification assessment found more than 93 percent of children in Gaza, or about 930,000, are on the brink of famine.On Wednesday, the Israeli army said it allowed 100 aid trucks carrying flour, baby food and medical equipment into Gaza. Yet UN officials said distribution problems had meant no aid had so far reached people in need.\u201cThe limited supplies finally being allowed to enter Kerem Shalom [in Arabic, the Karem Abu Salem border crossing] are nowhere near enough to meet the needs in Gaza, which are vast, which are tremendous. Much, much more aid needs to get in,\u201d said Stephane Dujarric, the UN chief\u2019s spokesperson.Aid groups have said the amount of aid that Israel is allowing is not nearly enough, calling Netanyahu\u2019s efforts a \u201csmokescreen to pretend the siege is over\u201d.\u201cThe Israeli authorities\u2019 decision to allow a ridiculously inadequate amount of aid into Gaza after months of an air-tight siege signals their intention to avoid the accusation of starving people in Gaza while, in fact, keeping them barely surviving,\u201d said Pascale Coissard, the emergency coordinator in Khan Younis for Doctors Without Borders.Critics were swift in reacting to Netanyahu\u2019s news conference. His \u201cwords today mean the occupation of Gaza for many years and waking up every day to the death of soldiers\u201d, opposition leader Yair Lapid said, adding that the country\u2019s international standing would collapse and the economy would be severely damaged.\u201cI saw a presentation by a pressured, obsessed, lying man who takes no responsibility for anything,\u201d the Democrats party leader Yair Golan said after the news conference. \u201cI will sue you for defamation because of the lies you spread about me, and we will defeat you in the elections very soon and send you to the pages of history.\u201dNetanyahu had slammed Golan on Tuesday after the opposition leader had said, \u201cA sane country \u2026 does not kill babies as a hobby.\u201d Netanyahu called the comment \u201cappalling\u201d."}

The band says they have been targets of a smear campaign for calling out Israel\u2019s genocidal war.KNEECAP STATEMENT:Since our statements at Coachella \u2014 exposing the ongoing genocide against the Palestinian people \u2014 we have faced a coordinated smear campaign.For over a year, we have used our shows to call out the British and Irish governments' complicity in war crimes.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/mBojb5QBOP\u2014 KNEECAP (@KNEECAPCEOL) April 25, 2025The Belfast trio is also well known for its political and satirical lyrics and use of symbolism associated with the Irish Republican movement, which seeks to unite Northern Ireland, currently part of the UK, with the Republic of Ireland.More than 3,600 people were killed during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland during \u201cThe Troubles\u201d involving the Irish Republican Army (IRA), pro-British Loyalist militias and the UK security forces.Kneecap takes its name from a brutal punishment, which involved being shot in the kneecaps, that was meted out by paramilitary groups to informers and drug dealers.The band has been praised for invigorating the Irish-language cultural scene in Northern Ireland, where the status of the language remains a contested political issue in a society still split between Protestant British Unionists and Catholic Irish Nationalist communities.It has also been criticised for lyrics laden with expletives and drug references.Kneecap came under intense scrutiny and criticism last month during their performance at the music festival Coachella in California when they projected the words \u201cF*** Israel. Free Palestine.\u201d on stage.\u201cThe Irish not so long ago were persecuted by the Brits, but we were never bombed from the f****** skies with nowhere to go! The Palestinians have nowhere to go \u2013 it\u2019s their f****** home and they\u2019re bombing them from the sky. If you\u2019re not calling it a genocide what the f*** are you calling it?\u201d said Mo Chara while on stage.Kneecap came under renewed scrutiny at the start of this month when UK intelligence said they would investigate comments made by the rap group about UK and Middle East politics.They were reported to police over footage from a 2024 concert in which a band member appeared to say: \u201cThe only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.\u201d Footage from another concert, in 2023, appears to show a member of the trio shouting \u201cUp Hamas, Up Hezbollah\u201d \u2013 the UK considers both to be \u201cterrorist\u201d organisations.In response, Kneecap said it had \u201cnever supported Hamas or Hezbollah,\u201d and accused \u201cestablishment figures\u201d of taking comments out of context to \u201cmanufacture moral hysteria\u201d because of the band\u2019s criticism of Israel\u2019s attacks on Palestinians in Gaza.Several Kneecap gigs have been cancelled as a result of the controversy, and some British lawmakers have called on organisers of June\u2019s Glastonbury Festival to scrap a planned performance by the group."}

But Bar said Netanyahu\u2019s decision was motivated by a series of events between November 2024 and February 2025.In the unclassified part of the court submission, Bar said Netanyahu had told him \u201con more than one occasion\u201d that he expected Shin Bet to take action against Israelis involved in anti-government demonstrations, \u201cwith a particular focus on monitoring the protests\u2019 financial backers\u201d.The Shin Bet head also said he had refused to sign off on a security request aimed at relieving Netanyahu from testifying at an ongoing corruption trial in which he faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of public trust.The court said the decision to dismiss Bar was made without \u201ca factual basis\u201d and without giving him a formal hearing before firing him, according to a report by the Times of Israel.Wednesday\u2019s ruling noted \u201cirregularities\u201d in the process that led to Bar\u2019s sacking, as well as \u201ca disregard for fundamental principles regarding internal security.\u201dThe Israeli cabinet voted to dismiss Bar in March, triggering mass protests and accusations of autocratic pursuits by the far-right government.The High Court of Justice halted the decision until a hearing could be held. Several groups, including opposition politicians, had filed petitions with the court against the government\u2019s decision.In April, the government revoked the decision to fire Bar a day after he said he would step down.Following Bar\u2019s decision to quit the job, Wednesday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling said that \u201cthis announcement puts an end to the [legal] procedure.\u201d"}

There were no injuries.The commander of the Israeli Civil Administration in the West Bank ordered Israeli officers to speak with representatives of the delegation\u2019s countries who \u201cwill soon hold personal conversations with the diplomats and update them on the findings of the initial investigation conducted on the matter\u201d, the military said in a statement.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan, because Al Jazeera has been banned from the West Bank and Israel, said the incident shows the reality on the ground and anyone in the occupied West Bank can come under Israeli fire.\u201cThese places in the Palestinian territory have come under complete siege \u2013 tens of thousands of Palestinians who have been forcibly uprooted from their homes as part of the ongoing military raids in Jenin, Tulkarem and in surrounding areas in the north of the occupied West Bank,\u201d she added.Videos on social media show delegation members giving media interviews when shots are heard ringing out close to the group and forcing it to run for cover.Footage verified by Al Jazeera\u2019s Sanad fact-checking agency also showed two Israeli soldiers standing nearby with their rifles pointing towards the diplomats.The occupation forces opened heavy fire from inside the Jenin refugee camp to intimidate the diplomatic delegation that is conducting a field tour around the camp to witness the extent of the suffering endured by the residents of the area.\u0642\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u062a\u0637\u0644\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0634\u0643\u0644 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0641 \u0645\u0646\u2026 pic.twitter.com/qafjqQP0Sg\u2014 State of Palestine \u2013 MFA \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 (@pmofa) May 21, 2025About 20 diplomats were being briefed at the time about the situation in Jenin, an aid worker speaking on condition of anonymity told The Associated Press news agency.

Israel\u2019s ambassador to Italy will be summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation to explain.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said firing even warning shots was unacceptable.

How many trucks has Israel let in?", "date": "21 May 2025", "media_type": "news", "link": null, "content": "Palestinians in Gaza are on the verge of starvation and are desperate for aid.But, despite Israel officially relenting and publicly stating that it will now allow trucks to enter Gaza after a more-than-two-month blockade, only five aid trucks have actually entered the territory as of Tuesday night.And, even with those trucks inside Gaza, humanitarian workers have been prevented from distributing the aid inside them, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) spokesperson Jens Laerke.The population of the Gaza Strip, more than two million people before Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, is on the brink of famine, numerous aid agencies have said, with up to 14,000 babies at risk of dying from malnutrition if aid does not reach them. Despite the immense humanitarian cost, Israel\u2019s siege of the Strip continues. Israel says 93 trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday, but even if that were true and the aid distributed, it still amounts to approximately 20 percent of the territory\u2019s daily pre-war needs.After 11 weeks of unrelenting siege, the situation within Gaza is reported by numerous agencies to be desperate.Half a million people, or one in five Palestinians, are facing starvation. The rest of the population is, according to the UN\u2019s Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), suffering from high levels of acute food insecurity.Since yesterday, a few trucks of delivery aid managed to enter #Gaza but @UNReliefChief says they are 'a drop in the ocean of what\u2019s required'.https://t.co/7H98MUwSqR@UN_Spokesperson briefing the press \u2935\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/fWzb7lg5U4\u2014 UN News (@UN_News_Centre) May 21, 2025\u201cThe risk of famine in the Gaza Strip is not just possible \u2013 it is increasingly likely,\u201d  the IPC said, warning that an official famine could be declared as a direct result of Israeli action at any point between now and September.Officially, a famine occurs when at least 20 percent (one-fifth) of households face extreme food shortages; more than 30 percent of children suffer from acute malnutrition; and at least two out of every 10,000 people or four out of every 10,000 children die each day from starvation or hunger-related causes.The term famine refers to more than simply hunger. It refers to one of the worst humanitarian emergencies possible, indicating a complete collapse of access to food, water and the systems necessary to support life.The World Health Organization (WHO) reported last week that at least 57 children have died from the effects of malnutrition since Israel\u2019s complete blockade began on March 2.Emergency coordinator in Gaza for Doctors Without Borders \u2013 known by its French initials, MSF \u2013 Pascale Coissard, described the aid allowed into Gaza as \u201cridiculously inadequate\u201d. The organisation said that Israel was only permitting food and medicine into Gaza as \u201ca smokescreen to pretend the siege is over\u201d.\u201cThe Israeli authorities\u2019 decision to allow a ridiculously inadequate amount of aid into Gaza after months of an air-tight siege signals their intention to avoid the accusation of starving people in Gaza, while, in fact, keeping them barely surviving,\u201d Coissard said.Israel faces intense international pressure to lift its siege on Gaza. Twenty-three nations, including many of Israel\u2019s traditional allies, have condemned Israel\u2019s action in Gaza, with the United Kingdom, France and Canada threatening sanctions if aid is not allowed to reach those trapped within the enclave.Even the United States, typically Israel\u2019s closest ally, has conceded that aid is not entering Gaza in \u201csufficient amounts\u201d to avert the threat of famine.Not particularly.Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in indiscriminate Israeli attacks over the last week, taking the overall death toll to more than 53,500.Of those, more than 3,500 have been killed since the Israeli government decided to unilaterally break a ceasefire on March 18 and resume its offensive on the Gaza Strip.On Sunday, the Israeli military confirmed that it had expanded ground operations in the northern and southern stretches of the Gaza Strip as part of what it said was an intensified campaign to gain the concessions from Hamas that had eluded it through nineteen months of intense warfare, the destruction of nearly all of Gaza\u2019s buildings and the killing of tens of thousands of civilians, the majority women and children.Despite the humanitarian cost, the decision to allow what critics say is a performative and insufficient amount of food and medicine into Gaza has proven controversial within Israel.Israel\u2019s ultranationalist National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir condemned the decision to allow the small amount of aid into Gaza, calling it \u201ca serious and grave mistake\u201d.However, Ben-Gvir\u2019s fellow traveller on the hard right, Finance Minister Beezalel Smotrich, defended the decision, saying in a televised statement that Israel would permit the \u201cminimum necessary\u201d so \u201cthat the world does not stop us and accuse us of war crimes\u201d."}

Among those killed were at least eight people in Gaza City, two people in central Gaza\u2019s Nuseirat camp and two people in the Maghazi camp in central Gaza, according to Al Jazeera reporters in Gaza.The attacks come after Israel began allowing dozens of humanitarian trucks into Gaza on Tuesday, but the aid has not yet reached Palestinians in desperate need.Jens Laerke, the spokesperson for the UN\u2019s humanitarian agency, said no trucks were picked up from the Gaza side of Karem Abu Salem crossing, known as Kerem Shalom to Israelis, in southern Gaza.Israel announced that 93 aid trucks had entered Gaza from Israel following an 11-week blockade.Reporting from Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum explained that most of those trucks had only received military clearance to enter the Palestinian side of the crossing.\u201cThey are still stuck at the border crossing. Only five trucks have made it in,\u201d Abu Azzoum said, adding, \u201cThis could be another sign of the systematic obstruction of aid in Gaza.\u201dAid groups have said that the amount of aid that Israel is allowing is not nearly enough, calling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s efforts a \u201csmokescreen to pretend the siege is over\u201d.\u201cThe Israeli authorities\u2019 decision to allow a ridiculously inadequate amount of aid into Gaza after months of an air-tight siege signals their intention to avoid the accusation of starving people in Gaza, while, in fact, keeping them barely surviving,\u201d said Pascale Coissard, the emergency coordinator in Khan Younis for Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF.The Israeli military body that oversees humanitarian aid to Gaza said trucks were entering Gaza on Wednesday morning, but it was unclear if that aid would be able to continue deeper into Gaza for distribution.A few dozen Israeli activists opposed to Israel\u2019s decision to allow aid into Gaza while Hamas still holds Israeli captives attempted to block the trucks carrying the aid on Wednesday morning, but were kept back by Israeli police.Israel is facing growing international pressure over its renewed offensive on Gaza.The United Kingdom has suspended talks with Israel on a free trade deal, and the European Union said it will review a pact on political and economic ties over the \u201ccatastrophic situation\u201d in Gaza. Britain, France and Canada have threatened \u201cconcrete actions\u201d if Israel continues its offensive.Pope Leo on Wednesday also appealed for Israel to allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.\u201cI renew my fervent appeal to allow for the entry of fair humanitarian help and to bring to an end the hostilities, the devastating price of which is paid by children, the elderly and the sick,\u201d the pope said during his weekly general audience in Saint Peter\u2019s Square.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday urged world leaders to take immediate action to end Israel\u2019s siege on Gaza, issuing the appeal in a written statement during a visit to Beirut, where he is expected to discuss the disarmament of Palestinian factions in Lebanon\u2019s refugee camps.\u201cI call on world leaders to take urgent and decisive measures to break the siege on our people in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Abbas said, demanding the immediate entry of aid, an end to the Israeli offensive, the release of detainees and a full withdrawal from Gaza.\u201cIt is time to end the war of extermination against the Palestinian people. I reiterate that we will not leave, and we will remain here on the land of our homeland, Palestine,\u201d Abbas said.Since the war began in October 2023 following the Hamas attack that killed 1,139 people in southern Israel, Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed 53,573 people and wounded 121,688 others."}

Here\u2019s everything you need to know:Officially independent, the GHF is an Israeli- and US-backed body that plans to distribute aid in the Gaza Strip.One in five people in Gaza currently face starvation due to the Israeli blockade of food and aid while 93 percent are experiencing acute food shortages, according to a UN-backed assessment released last week.Under increasing international pressure to allow in aid, Israel has sought to find a solution that it says prevents aid from falling into the hands of the Palestinian group Hamas. Humanitarian organisations say the vast majority of food and other supplies reaches Gaza\u2019s civilian population and is not diverted to fighters.The GHF will be overseen by Jake Wood, a US military veteran who ran Team Rubicon, an organisation that distributed humanitarian aid during natural disasters.Through the GHF, Palestinians in Gaza would receive a \u201cbasic amount of food\u201d.The initial plan was announced last Wednesday with a timeline of about two weeks before it was up and running.It\u2019s still unclear how the GHF will be funded, but the foundation says it will set up \u201csecure distribution sites\u201d to feed 1.2 million people in Gaza before expanding to feed every Palestinian in the territory.It says it will coordinate with the Israeli military while security would be provided by private military contractors.The GHF initiative has been widely panned by aid groups and the UN.The UN and humanitarian aid agencies say they already have the means to distribute desperately needed aid and alleviate the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. The GHF, on the other hand, is seen by critics as a way of politicising aid and not having the experience or capacity to bring aid to more than two million people.The GHF \u201crestricts aid to only one part of Gaza while leaving other dire needs unmet\u201d, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said at the Security Council last week. \u201cIt makes aid conditional on political and military aims. It makes starvation a bargaining chip. It is cynical sideshow. A deliberate distraction. A fig leaf for further violence and displacement.\u201dThe UN and aid groups say the GHF plan violates basic humanitarian principles.\u201cWe are concerned by the proposed aid mechanism for Gaza and are deeply worried that it will not allow for humanitarian aid to be distributed in a manner consistent with core humanitarian principles of impartiality, humanity, and independence,\u201d a statement from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. \u201cThe ICRC cannot work under any mechanism that doesn\u2019t allow us to uphold the principles and our modalities of work.\u201dEleven humanitarian and human rights organisations signed a statement in which they \u201cunequivocally reject the establishment\u201d of the GHF, calling it:\u201cA project led by politically connected Western security and military figures, coordinated in tandem with the Israeli government, and launched while the people of Gaza remain under total siege. It lacks any Palestinian involvement in its design or implementation.\u201dThat lack of Palestinian involvement, coupled with Israel\u2019s approval for the project and the planned presence of the Israeli military \u201con the perimeter\u201d of the distribution sites, according to US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, raises Palestinian suspicions that the establishment of the GHF will give even more power to Israel over aid distribution in Gaza.Israel is blocking it.Israel began preventing the entry of all food and other humanitarian supplies into Gaza on March 2 during a ceasefire, which it unilaterally broke on March 18.Even before the blockade, Israel restricted the amount of aid that could come in, and some Israeli protesters also blocked and destroyed aid.The situation has reached dire levels with the World Food Programme saying 70,000 children need urgent treatment for \u201cacute malnutrition\u201d.The UN said the GHF would weaponise aid by threatening the mass displacement of Palestinians.Initial aid distribution sites would operate only out of southern and central Gaza, which the UN warned could lead to the displacement of Palestinians in northern Gaza as they are forced to move south for food and other aid.\u201cHumanitarian aid should not be politicized nor militarized,\u201d the ICRC statement said. \u201cThis erodes the neutrality required to ensure assistance is delivered based solely on need, not political or military agendas.\u201dThe initiative has also been labelled by many in the humanitarian sector as insufficient.\u201cEven if implemented, the plan\u2019s proposed aid volumes fall short of the immense scale of needs in Gaza,\u201d according to the ICRC. \u201cThe level of need right now is overwhelming, and aid needs to be allowed to enter immediately and without impediment.\u201dGaza currently has 400 distribution points, and the ability and know-how to distribute aid effectively exists. With only a few distribution points under the GHF, people may be forced to walk long distances and carry heavy rations.\u201cThe Problem is Not Logistics,\u201d the statement from the 11 humanitarian groups read. \u201cIt Is Intentional Starvation.\u201dEnough. We demand rapid, safe, and unimpeded access to starving civilians in Gaza.We have a plan. We have thousands of trucks of food at the border. Let us in. Let us work.https://t.co/J55f8shIEU pic.twitter.com/bTmcAMbG0e\u2014 Tom Fletcher (@UNReliefChief) May 16, 2025People with disabilities or who are injured would struggle to navigate the terrain and reach distribution points. The roads in Gaza have been badly damaged over the past 19 months of war, and the intensity of Israel\u2019s latest military operation in Gaza is only making things more difficult for Palestinians there.Furthermore, the GHF\u2019s assertions that it is independent and transparent have been criticised by aid groups.\u201cDespite branding itself as \u2018independent\u2019 and \u2018transparent,\u2019 the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation would be wholly dependent on Israeli coordination and operates via Israeli-controlled entry points, primarily the Port of Ashdod and the Kerem Shalom/Karem Abu Salem crossing,\u201d the statement by the 11 aid groups read.While Hanan Salah, Human Rights Watch\u2019s associate director for the Middle East and North Africa, didn\u2019t comment specifically on the GHF, she said allowing \u201ca basic amount of food\u201d into the Gaza Strip was \u201ccomplicity in using starvation as a method of warfare\u201d."}

We\u2019re supportive,\u201d Rubio continued. \u201cWe understand why for their security Hamas cannot exist. We are also very happy to see that they have allowed aid to begin to flow, and we hope that that will continue.\u201dSeveral Western countries, including close partners of Israel, have recently decried the Israeli siege on Gaza. On Monday, the leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Canada said in a joint statement that they were \u201chorrified\u201d by Israel\u2019s military escalations in Gaza and its blockade on humanitarian aid.They threatened to pursue \u201cconcrete actions\u201d like sanctions if Israel continued to expand its military assault.The administration of US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has remained staunchly pro-Israel, but experts say recent moves from the White House signal a growing gap between the US and Israel.For example, Trump did not include Israel as a stop in his recent trip to the Middle East. He has also initiated diplomatic talks with Iran and declared a ceasefire with Yemen\u2019s Houthi group \u2014 both of which are adversaries of Israel in the region.The Houthis, for instance, continue to launch missiles and drones at Israel in a show of support for the Palestinians in Gaza.Still, over the past three months, the US has refused to directly criticise Israel\u2019s decision to prevent food and medicine from reaching Gaza.But last week, at a stop in the United Arab Emirates, Trump indicated he wanted to get the situation in Gaza \u201ctaken care of\u201d.\u201cA lot of people are starving. There\u2019s a lot of bad things going on,\u201d he said.Also last week, in an interview with the BBC, Rubio said he was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher also told the BBC on Tuesday that as many as 14,000 children in Gaza are at risk of dying in the next 48 hours if food does not reach them.Last year, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant over possible war crimes in Gaza, including the use of starvation as a method of war.On Sunday, Netanyahu said Israel would only allow a \u201cbasic quantity of food\u201d into the Palestinian territory to stave off international pressure.\u201cOur best friends in the world \u2013 senators I know as strong supporters of Israel \u2013 have warned that they cannot support us if images of mass starvation emerge,\u201d he said, according to the publication Haaretz.The Gaza Government Media Office said on Tuesday that at least 58 Palestinians have died of malnutrition over the past 80 days.At Tuesday\u2019s Senate hearing, Rubio appeared to acknowledge that more aid needs to reach the Palestinians in Gaza.\u201cI understand your point that it\u2019s not in sufficient amounts,\u201d Rubio told Merkley. \u201cBut we were pleased to see that decision was made.\u201d"}

As of Monday, a trickle of aid was authorised to enter for the first time since then but was not immediately distributed.Addressing the European Humanitarian Forum in Brussels on Tuesday, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), said relief organisations have run out of words to describe the horrors unfolding in Gaza at Israel\u2019s hands.\u201cBut the worst in all this is that we are confronted with a situation: If there is political will, the war can stop. The siege being imposed on Gaza can be lifted,\u201d Lazzarini said.Since early March, at least 57 children are reported to have died from malnutrition.A UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) assessment says more than 93 percent of children in Gaza, or about 930,000, are at risk of famineUNRWA Director of Health Akihiro Seita added on Tuesday that the situation is getting \u201cexponentially\u201d worse and may soon arrive at a point that is \u201cbeyond our control\u201d.Israel told the UN on Tuesday that it would allow the entry of 100 trucks carrying humanitarian aid, a day after it said it allowed only nine aid trucks into the enclave for the first time in more than 80 days.But UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said no humanitarian aid has been distributed yet, despite more supplies being dropped off on the Palestinian side of the Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) crossing.The Israeli moves have been roundly slammed for fulfilling only a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d of the humanitarian needs in Gaza, which has been largely reduced to rubble by Israeli air strikes and ground operations, which were expanded at the weekend.Israeli attacks continue to kill dozens of Palestinians, including many children, each day while what\u2019s left of infrastructure and aid supplies are being destroyed.The municipality of Deir el-Balah in central Gaza announced on Tuesday that a major well, the last remaining source of drinking water in the area, was destroyed along with its generator in an Israeli strike.This comes as more than 100,000 Palestinians have been driven out of their homes and shelters in the past several days alone, according to the UN, and have nowhere safe to go as they face famine.The Israeli army on Tuesday bombed the Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza\u2019s Khan Younis as well, hitting life-saving medical supplies and causing widespread destruction across the hospital\u2019s different facilities, including oxygen lines and a laboratory.\u201cIn northern Gaza, the Indonesian Hospital is under siege by the Israeli military with patients unable to enter or get out,\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s Hind Khoudary said, reporting from Deir el-Balah.\u201cAside from the Nasser and Indonesian hospitals, two other major hospitals in Gaza, the European and al-Awda, have been bombed and largely put out of service in the past few days,\u201d she added.Tess Ingram, a UNICEF communications manager, explained to Al Jazeera why a scheme hatched by the United States and Israel to take control of aid distribution in Gaza was unacceptable for the international community.She said the UN and its international partners had 400 distribution points all over Gaza to help Palestinians whereas now only a \u201chandful\u201d of militarised points in southern Gaza will be used under the US-Israel plan.\u201cThis would mean that people would have to walk a long way to collect a packet that weighs up to 25kg [55lb] and then walk back again,\u201d she said.Speaking on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasised that only a \u201cminimal\u201d amount of aid will be allowed into Gaza for diplomatic and political reasons as international pressure and condemnation is directed at him and his government.His far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said allowing any aid into Gaza while some Israeli captives taken during the Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023, are still held inside the enclave is \u201ca grave mistake hindering our victory\u201d.As the Israeli military and government continue to promise to \u201cdefeat\u201d Hamas, devastating military strikes on the Palestinian territory have intensified.The Israeli army said on Tuesday afternoon that it attacked 100 targets in Gaza in the preceding 24 hours, claiming they were all \u201cterrorist\u201d targets.At least 53,573 Palestinians have been killed and 121,688 wounded since the start of the war, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health."}

The ministry called the UK sanctions \u201cunjustified and regrettable\u201d.The Labour government has been heavily criticised at home for not saying or doing enough in support of Palestinians under constant fire and facing starvation in besieged Gaza. Thousands of pro-Palestine demonstrators turn out for weekly marches in Britain.Labour MP Zarah Sultana accused Starmer\u2019s government of being \u201ccomplicit\u201d in a \u201ccampaign of collective punishment waged with impunity\u201d.She told Al Jazeera: \u201cFamilies have been obliterated, entire neighbourhoods reduced to rubble, and essential services like food, water and electricity deliberately targeted.\u201cThis is not a tragic accident of war. It is the predictable result of a campaign of collective punishment waged with impunity \u2026 The UK\u2019s failure to act is not just a moral disgrace \u2013 it is a political choice.\u201dFormer Labour Party leader and independent MP Jeremy Corbyn also told Al Jazeera the \u201conly one way the government can cease its complicity in genocide\u201d is by \u201cending military cooperation with Israel and imposing sanctions\u201d.Although the Labour government suspended some arms export licences to Israel, it made an exception for the F-35 fighter jet programme, citing its obligations to international supply chains.Meanwhile, a report from the Palestinian Youth Movement, Progressive International and Workers for a Free Palestine revealed earlier this month that the UK sent \u201c8,630 separate munitions\u201d since the partial arms suspension took effect in September.According to the UK government\u2019s own data released on Thursday, it approved 127.6 million pounds ($171m) worth of military equipment to Israel in single-issue licences between October and December 2024 \u2013 despite the partial arms embargo coming into place in September.Last week, a High Court case was launched challenging the UK\u2019s handling of arms export controls to Israel.Gearoid O Cuinn, founding director of the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), which has taken the UK government to court over the sale of weapons, told Al Jazeera that the government\u2019s decision to suspend a future trade deal has \u201cno bearing on the immediate catastrophe in Gaza\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s not a future trade deal that is facilitating the killing and starving kids,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ongoing supply of British weaponry and military support.\u201dAs international pressure intensifies on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government, the European Commission has launched a review of its trade agreement with Israel in response to the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d situation in Gaza.The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said a \u201cstrong majority\u201d of EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels supported the review of the bloc\u2019s association agreement with Israel.The move aims to determine whether Israel has breached its human rights obligations under Article 2 of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.France\u2019s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, speaking in parliament, welcomed the decision and said 17 of the EU\u2019s 27 member states had backed the proposal.Kallas also confirmed that EU sanctions targeting violent Israeli settlers had been drawn up but remain blocked by one member state, which she did not name.\u201cThe aid that Israel has allowed in is, of course, welcomed,\u201d Kallas said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a drop in the ocean. Aid must flow immediately, without obstruction and at scale, because this is what is needed.\u201d"}

Israel reportedly allowed in just a few trucks on Monday, but more were expected on Tuesday.They said they would not \u201cstand by\u201d while Israel pursued \u201cegregious actions\u201d, highlighting the \u201cabhorrent language\u201d on pushing Palestinians out of Gaza used by members of the Israeli government like Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and underlining that forced displacement would be illegal.Husam Zumlot, the Palestinian ambassador to the UK, told Al Jazeera that the \u201cnumber one\u201d thing the three countries could do was impose an arms embargo on Israel. \u201cThe UK has taken some measures to suspend some arms exports.

You need to impose sanctions on the state. It\u2019s not about the prime minister. This is the entire government enterprise,\u201d she told Al Jazeera on Monday.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Tuesday that Israel\u2019s partial lifting of the blockade on Monday was \u201ctotally insufficient\u201d.\u201cIndiscriminate violence and the blocking of humanitarian aid by the Israeli government\u201d had turned the besieged territory into \u201ca death trap\u201d, he told France Inter radio.Reporting from Jordan\u2019s capital Amman, Al Jazeera\u2019s Hamdah Salhut questioned whether international pressure would have much effect on Netanyahu, pointing out his previously voiced intention to press on until \u201cabsolute victory\u201d and his belief that his country was fighting a \u201cwar of civilisation against barbarism\u201d.\u201cThey say that the expanding military ground offensive is the only way for them to move forward,\u201d she said.The three leaders spoke out as 23 countries, including the UK, France and Canada, issued a joint statement urging Israel to let aid into Gaza, warning that the population faced \u201cstarvation\u201d.The statement, published on Monday, said humanitarian aid should never be politicised, taking aim at Israel\u2019s \u201cnew model\u201d for aid, which would see the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation delivering supplies under Israeli military protection.\u201cIt places beneficiaries and aid workers at risk, undermines the role and independence of the United Nations and our trusted partners, and links humanitarian aid to political and military objectives,\u201d said the statement, which called on Israel to let the UN and aid organisations get on with their life-saving work.Al Jazeera\u2019s Step Vaessen, reporting from Amsterdam in the Netherlands, noted that the statement had been issued before Tuesday\u2019s meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Brussels, where it is expected the bloc\u2019s trade agreement with Israel will be coming under review.\u201cWhat we are seeing is a shift after one and a half years of ongoing bombardment on Gaza, with this blockade on food leading to a public outcry,\u201d she said.Human rights organisation Amnesty International said it was \u201coutrageous and morally reprehensible\u201d that the world had taken \u201cnearly 80 days of broadcast starvation and cruelty amidst genocide\u201d to exert pressure on Israel to lift its siege.As the world focused its attention on Israel, the military stepped up its deadly attacks across the Strip. At least 87 people were killed and 290 wounded during the past 24-hour reporting period, according to a daily update by the Gaza Health Ministry.The casualties bring the total number of people confirmed killed in Gaza during the war to 53,573 with 121,688 wounded, the ministry said."}

The past week has seen an intensification of violence across the besieged Palestinian territory, which has killed hundreds of people.The reason for the disappearance of the NGO provision remains unclear, and experts warned it may yet reappear in the bill before the final vote in the House, expected later in the week.The office of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera\u2019s request for comment.With a razor-thin majority in the House, Republicans need every vote to pass the tax bill, which Trump has put at the top of his agenda in Congress.Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the section may have been removed to avoid additional controversy for the must-pass bill, especially because the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan office that oversees procedures, may have rejected it for violating the rules.\u201cIt\u2019s possible that this is a hiccup that they didn\u2019t want, given that it wasn\u2019t even likely to go through,\u201d Hamadanchy told Al Jazeera.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that is the reason for sure. What I can tell you is that we continue to be very vigilant in case it comes back, either later this week or in the future.\u201dFor weeks, Trump has been calling on Congress to pass the bill, which extends his 2017 tax cuts, a key component of his economic plans.But the proposal has faced some opposition from conservative budget hawks, who have argued it does not cut spending enough and would add to the nation\u2019s $36.2 trillion debt. So Republicans can ill-afford unnecessary issues that could derail the passage of the legislation.Rights groups have been rallying against the \u201cnonprofit killer\u201d, saying it violates free speech and the right to due process.The proposal would have granted the secretary of state power to unilaterally declare an NGO \u201cterrorist supporting\u201d and make it ineligible for tax exemptions.It also said the government would not have to reveal the reason behind the designation if \u201cdisclosure of such description would be inconsistent with national security or law enforcement interests\u201d.Under the current rules, organisations certified to be nonprofits by the government get breaks on their federal income taxes. The status also makes donations to such groups tax deductible for donors.While the withdrawn measure would have allowed a targeted NGO to challenge the secretary of state\u2019s decision in court, losing the tax exempt status, even if temporarily, could have proven costly for nonprofits, especially smaller organisations.Hamadanchy said being accused of supporting terrorism could also have prompted banks to close down the accounts of the groups.\u201cAnd then you have legal costs fighting off the designation because even if you might win in court, it\u2019s going to take time to get there, and it\u2019s going to cause a lot of damage to your organisation through that process,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd that\u2019s sort of the point because they want to chill speech.\u201dHamadanchy noted that existing laws already make material support for a designated \u201cterrorist\u201d group a criminal offence with severe penalties.The legislative push coincided with the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on Palestinian rights supporters, especially on college campuses.Secretary of State Marco Rubio has revoked the student visas of several Palestine advocates \u2013 who have not been charged with a criminal offence \u2013 over allegations of \u201csupport for terrorism\u201d.Some advocacy groups have portrayed the \u201cnonprofit killer\u201d as part of a broader push to muzzle voices critical of Israel.\u201cThis bill is designed to silence dissent, especially from Muslim, Palestinian and civil rights organizations that speak out against injustice and genocide,\u201d the Council on American Islamic Relations said in a statement last week.\u201cIt threatens every nonprofit that engages in advocacy, educates the public, or challenges government policy.\u201dThe apparent setback for the nonprofit provision came nearly two weeks after House leaders cancelled a vote on a bill to restrict boycotts of Israel after a backlash from right-wing legislators who voiced opposition to the measure on free speech grounds.Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, said it would be \u201cinteresting\u201d to see how Republican leaders would deal with staunchly pro-Israel measures like the \u201cnonprofit killer\u201d going forward.\u201cThey on the one hand likely see this as a fun opportunity to embarrass Democrats \u2013 whose opposition will be framed as anti-Israel or enabling terror and antisemitism \u2013 and on the other hand they have to worry about principled opposition from within their own ranks,\u201d Friedman told Al Jazeera in a statement."}

Food security experts last week warned of famine amid accusations that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war.\u201cSignificantly more aid must be allowed into Gaza starting tomorrow morning,\u201d Fletcher said in a statement.The UN secretary-general\u2019s spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, confirmed the limited aid will be distributed through the world body\u2019s mechanisms but also reiterated the amount of aid crossing into Gaza \u201cis not enough\u201d.The Israeli decision on Sunday to allow \u201cminimal\u201d aid into Gaza came as it launched an intensified ground offensive during an ongoing heavy bombardment that has killed hundreds of people over the past week.On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video address pressure from international \u201callies\u201d was behind the move.Israel\u2019s \u201cgreatest friends in the world\u201d, he declared without mentioning specific countries, had said there is \u201c\u2018one thing we cannot stand. We cannot accept images of hunger, mass hunger. We cannot stand that. We will not be able to support you\u2019.\u201cTherefore, to achieve victory, we need to somehow solve the problem,\u201d Netanyahu said, stressing the aim of the intensified offensive is for Israel\u2019s forces to \u201ctake control of all\u201d of Gaza.Still, far-right members of his coalition government slammed the aid decision, with National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir calling it a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d.It came as the leaders of Britain, France and Canada warned their countries would take action, including possible sanctions, if Israel does not halt its renewed military offensive in Gaza and lift aid restrictions.\u201cThe Israeli Government\u2019s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable and risks breaching International Humanitarian Law,\u201d a joint statement released by the British government said, also expressing opposition to any attempt to expand settlements in the occupied West Bank.\u201cWe will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions,\u201d it added.Separately, 22 donor countries also issued a joint statement on Monday urging Israel to \u201callow a full resumption of aid into Gaza immediately\u201d.\u201cWhilst we acknowledge indications of a limited restart of aid,\u201d Gaza\u2019s population \u201cfaces starvation\u201d and \u201cmust receive the aid they desperately need\u201d, it said.The statement was signed by the foreign ministers of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK.Israel has been accused of weaponising hunger and using the blockade to try to ethnically cleanse Gaza.The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a US-based Muslim and Arab rights group, said the decision to allow a handful of aid trucks into the territory is an effort to buy goodwill as Israel continues a relentless military campaign that has killed more than 53,000 people over the past 19 months.\u201cThis is a completely insufficient, psychotic PR stunt by Netanyahu\u2019s genocidal government, which is determined to occupy and flatten Gaza, and then expel any Palestinians who survive,\u201d it said in a statement.Speaking at the opening of the annual World Health Assembly on Monday, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that Israel\u2019s block on aid has driven up the risk of famine.\u201cTwo million people are starving,\u201d Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned, noting that 160,000 tonnes of food are \u201cblocked at the border just minutes away\u201d.He said the WHO and other UN agencies stood ready to deliver aid into Gaza \u2013 if and when entrance is allowed. \u201cPeople are dying from preventable diseases as medicines wait at the border, while attacks on hospitals deny people care and deter them from seeking it,\u201d Tedros added.On Sunday, the Health Ministry in Gaza said the Indonesian Hospital, one of the largest partially functioning medical facilities in northern Gaza, had ceased work because of Israeli attacks.As Israel intensifies its offensive across Gaza, sources told the Reuters news agency there has been no progress in a new round of indirect talks in Qatar\u2019s capital, Doha between the Israeli government and Hamas, the Palestinian group that headed an attack in southern Israel on October 7, 2023 that killed an estimated 1,139 people, with more than 200 also taken captive."}

Human rights groups and United Nations-backed experts have accused Israel of systematically destroying Gaza\u2019s healthcare system.Earlier, Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of al-Shifa Hospital in the besieged enclave\u2019s north, told Al Jazeera on Sunday that the latest strikes \u2013 which have been ongoing since Saturday \u2013 indicate that Israeli attacks on Gaza\u2019s hospitals are intensifying.\u201cThe medical teams are really suffering, and we have a few numbers of medical teams and staff \u2026 and a lot of people are in need [of] more medical care,\u201d Abu Salmiya said by phone from the hospital on Sunday.Thousands of sick and wounded people could die, he warned. Blood donations are urgently needed.This has been underscored by Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which confirmed that Israeli forces besieged the facility in Beit Lahiya, adding that \u201ca state of panic and confusion is prevailing\u201d.The ministry later said that Israel had cut off the arrival of patients and staff, \u201ceffectively forcing the hospital out of service\u201d.With \u201cthe shutdown of the Indonesian Hospital, all public hospitals in the North Gaza Governorate are now out of service\u201d, it said.Gaza\u2019s healthcare facilities have been targeted repeatedly throughout Israel\u2019s deadly assault that began 18 months ago.Other facilities in the north that have been bombed, burned, and besieged by the Israeli military since the start of the war include Kamal Adwan Hospital, al-Shifa Hospital, al-Ahli Hospital, and al-Awda Hospital. Dozens of other medical clinics, stations, and vehicles have also come under attack.The targeting of health facilities, medical personnel and patients is considered a war crime under the 1949 Geneva Convention.Israel has also battered several hospitals in Gaza\u2019s central and southern areas, including Deir el-Balah\u2019s Al-Aqsa Hospital and the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.Earlier this week, Israel struck two hospitals in Khan Younis. Nine missiles slammed into and around the courtyard of the European Gaza Hospital, killing at least 16 people, while an attack on the Nasser Medical Complex killed two people, including a wounded journalist.Incessant attacks on Gaza\u2019s healthcare sector have left it reeling, devastating its ability to function, while doctors say they are out of medicine to treat routine conditions.Hospitals have also been on the verge of total collapse amid a brutal and ongoing blockade, where Israel continues to bar the entry of much-needed medical supplies, fuel, and other humanitarian aid including food and clean water.The crisis in Gaza has reached one of its darkest periods, humanitarian officials warn, as famine also looms.Israeli air strikes have killed hundreds of Palestinians in the last 72 hours.Strikes over the weekend have also put the European Hospital, the only remaining facility providing cancer treatments in Gaza, out of service.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said dozens of Palestinians have been wounded, and doctors say \u201cthey\u2019re facing numerous challenges in treating injuries because of a lack of medical supplies\u201d.\u201cIsraeli air strikes in Gaza are still escalating as drones and fighter jets hover in the sky,\u201d Khoudary said.The death toll has reached the same level of intensity as the earliest days of the war, said Emily Tripp, executive director of Airwars, an independent group in London that tracks recent conflicts.She says preliminary data indicate the number of incidents where at least one person was killed or injured by Israeli fire hovered around 700 in April. It\u2019s a figure comparable only to October or December 2023 \u2013 one of the heaviest periods of bombardment.In the last 10 days of March, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) estimates, an average of 100 children were killed or maimed by Israeli air strikes every day.Almost 3,000 of the estimated 53,000 killed by Israel since October 7, 2023, have lost their lives since Israel broke a fragile ceasefire on March 18, Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry said.Among those killed in recent days include a volunteer pharmacist with the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund, who was killed with her family in a strike on Gaza City on May 4.A midwife from Al Awda Health and Community Association was also killed with her family in another strike on May 7.A journalist working for Qatar-based television network Al Araby TV, along with 11 members of his family, was also killed."}

At least 53,339 Palestinians have been killed and 121,034 wounded since the start of the war in October 2023, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health.The Israeli army on Sunday confirmed the start of Operation Gideon\u2019s Chariots, which will involve regular and reserve soldiers of the Southern Command leading the ground invasion of both northern and southern Gaza, backed by the air force.It reported attacking more than 670 places in Gaza over the past week and claimed all were \u201cHamas targets\u201d located both above and beneath the ground. Israel has been accused of disproportionately targeting civilians in Gaza, including displaced families.Among the targets have been three major hospitals, adding to the systematic targeting of healthcare facilities across the enclave that has now put three hospitals out of commission this week alone.The Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza was rendered nonoperational on Sunday after the Israeli army laid siege to it beginning at dawn. Marwan al-Sultan, the director of the facility, which was the last functioning public hospital in the north, described the situation as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and called on international organisations to press for medical teams\u2019 safety.Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, told Al Jazeera that the bombing of the Indonesian Hospital is severely impacting chances of survival for those in need of medical care.Thousands of sick and wounded people could die, he warned, adding that blood donations are urgently needed.Dr Muhammad Zaqout, the director general of hospitals in Gaza, condemned \u201cIsrael\u2019s systematic measures against hospitals\u201d.\u201cIsrael deliberately kills wounded people by preventing them from reaching hospitals and directly targets patients, the wounded and medical staff inside hospitals,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.He said al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza\u2019s Jabalia and European Gaza Hospital in southern Gaza have also been bombed, endangering patients and medical staff.Hamas said in a statement early on Sunday that the attacks on displaced Palestinians in Khan Younis marked a \u201cbrutal crime\u201d that was a flagrant violation of international laws and norms.\u201cBy granting the terrorist occupation government political and military cover, the United States administration bears direct responsibility for this insane escalation in the targeting of innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip, including children, women, and the elderly,\u201d the Palestinian group said, also condemning the \u201congoing persecution and killing\u201d of media workers.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Israel\u2019s expanding operation in Gaza. \u201cI am alarmed by reported plans by Israel to expand ground operations and more,\u201d he said on X on Saturday.On Saturday, both Israel and Hamas confirmed that more mediated talks were under way in Qatar.Israel emphasised that the talks are being held with no conditions, including the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which it has completely blocked since March 2 despite looming famine.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signalled on Sunday that his government may be open to either a partial or a comprehensive agreement but only under strict conditions.\u201cEven at this very moment, the negotiation team in Doha is working to exhaust every possibility for a deal \u2013 whether according to the Witkoff framework or as part of ending the fighting, which would include the release of all the hostages, the exile of Hamas terrorists, and the disarmament of the Gaza Strip,\u201d his office said in a statement, referring to White House envoy Steve Witkoff.His office also slammed former Israeli negotiator Oren Setter, who resigned from the team in October and said in a February interview that Netanyahu had squandered two opportunities last year that would have released captives in exchange for ending the war.Setter, a retired brigadier general, criticised Netanyahu on Sunday, telling the public broadcaster Kan that he is concerned the government will once again \u201cmiss the opportunity\u201d of a comprehensive agreement in favour of a potential partial deal.Far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir on Sunday called on Netanyahu to pull the negotiating team back from Doha and refrain from signing any deal with Hamas.

He called Israel a \u201cdangerous cancerous tumour\u201d that must be \u201cuprooted\u201d.Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also told a gathering of navy officers on Saturday that Trump is extending a message of peace while threatening destruction at the same time as backing Israel\u2019s \u201cgenocide\u201d in the Gaza Strip.\u201cWhich one of this president\u2019s words should we believe? His message of peace, or his message of massacre of human beings?\u201d the Iranian president said, pointing out that Trump sanctioned the International Criminal Court (ICC) in a move that was internationally criticised.The statements came after Trump used his Middle East tour \u2013 during which he signed huge deals with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 to heap praise on Arab leaders neighbouring Iran and blasting the leadership in Tehran.The US president told Arab leaders they were developing their infrastructure while Iran\u2019s \u201clandmarks are collapsing into rubble\u201d after its theocratic establishment replaced a monarchy in a 1979 revolution.He said Iran\u2019s leaders have \u201cmanaged to turn green farmland into dry deserts\u201d as a result of corruption and mismanagement, and pointed out that Iranians are experiencing power outages several hours a day.The blackouts, a result of a years-long energy crisis that is hurting Iran\u2019s already strained economy, are expected to linger for the rest of this year as well, according to Iranian authorities.The largest associations of the mining, steel and cement industries in Iran on Saturday wrote a joint letter to Pezeshkian, urgently requesting him to review a 90 percent electricity use restriction imposed on the critical sectors.Trump, who hailed Syria\u2019s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa and lifted sanctions on Damascus, also took aim at Iran\u2019s regional policy.He described Tehran\u2019s support for the fallen establishment of President Bashar al-Assad as a cause of \u201cmisery and death\u201d and regional destabilisation.Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the US president\u2019s remarks as \u201cdeceptive\u201d, telling state media on Friday it was the US that hampered Iran through sanctions and military threats while backing Israel and attacking Syria.Parliament chief Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who was addressing an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference in Indonesia, said Trump\u2019s remarks showed he was \u201cliving in a delusion\u201d.Hossein Salami, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), addressed Trump directly on Friday and said even though Iran has beautiful landmarks, \u201cwe take pride in the elevation of character, identity, culture, and Islam\u201d.The sharp rhetoric in response to Trump\u2019s latest controversial comments come days after he teased that he may start calling the \u201cPersian Gulf\u201d the \u201cArabian Gulf\u201d soon.This angered Iranians across the board, prompting criticism of any attempt to rename the key waterway from average citizens online, authorities, local media, and even some pro-Trump Iranians outside the country who have been advocating for US sanctions and regime change.Both Iran and the US say they would prefer an agreement that would serve to quickly de-escalate tensions surrounding Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, despite the latest war of words.But after four rounds of negotiations mediated by Oman, any prospective deal \u2013 which would lift sanctions in exchange for making sure Iran would not have a nuclear bomb \u2013 still appears to face significant hurdles.Trump said Tehran has been handed a proposal to rapidly advance towards a deal, but Iran\u2019s Araghchi on Friday said no written proposal was produced yet amid \u201cconfusing and contradictory\u201d rhetoric from Washington.\u201cMark my words: there is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to enrichment for peaceful purposes: a right afforded to all other NPT signatories, too,\u201d he wrote in a post on X, in reference to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.Kazem Gharibabadi, a senior nuclear negotiator, on Friday rejected reports by Western media outlets that Iran may agree to fully halt its enrichment of uranium for the remainder of the Trump presidency to build trust.\u201cThe right to enrich is our absolute red line! No halt to enrichment is acceptable.\u201dTrump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear accord signed between Iran and world powers three years earlier, imposing the harshest sanctions yet by the US that have only intensified during the latest negotiations.The nuclear deal set a 3.67 percent enrichment rate with first-generation centrifuges for civilian use in Iran, in exchange for lifting United Nations sanctions. Iran is now enriching up to 60 percent and has enough fissile material for multiple bombs, but has made no effort to build one yet."}

And we have the aid itself \u2013 160,000 pallets of it \u2013 ready to move. Now,\u201d he said.\u201cWe demand rapid, safe, and unimpeded aid delivery for civilians in need. Let us work.\u201dIsrael has halted the entry of food, medication and all other essentials into Gaza since March 2. UN agencies and other humanitarian groups have warned of shrinking food, fuel and medicine supplies to the territory of 2.4 million Palestinians facing acute starvation.Earlier, the US and Israel said they were preparing a plan that would allow the resumption of aid by an NGO, while keeping supplies out of Hamas\u2019s hands.Under the heavily criticised alternative aid plan, the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aims to start work in Gaza by the end of May.It intends to work with private US security and logistics firms to transport aid into Gaza to so-called secure hubs where it will then be distributed by aid groups, a source familiar with the plan told the Reuters news agency. It is unclear how the foundation will be funded.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has also asked Israel to allow humanitarian deliveries by the UN and aid groups to resume now until its infrastructure is fully operational, saying this is essential to \u201calleviate the ongoing humanitarian pressure\u201d.The UN, however, said it would not work with the foundation because the distribution plan is not impartial, neutral or independent. Israel says the blockade, alongside \u201cmilitary pressure\u201d, is intended to force Hamas to free the remaining captives.On Thursday, senior Hamas official Basem Naim reiterated the group\u2019s position that the entry of aid into Gaza is a prerequisite for any truce talks with Israel.\u201cAccess to food, water and medicine is a fundamental human right \u2013 not a subject for negotiation,\u201d he said."}

In recent days, Israel has intensified its offensive, as tens of thousands of Palestinians are forced to starve.At a preparatory meeting of the Arab League summit, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said they will try to endorse decisions that were made at their meeting in Cairo in March to support Gaza\u2019s reconstruction as an alternative to Trump\u2019s widely condemned proposal to take over the enclave.During his visit to Qatar, Trump on Thursday reiterated that he wanted the US to \u201ctake\u201d Gaza and turn it into a \u201cfreedom zone\u201d. Earlier this year, he caused an uproar by declaring that the US would turn Gaza into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East\u201d, prompting Arab leaders to come up with a plan to rebuild the territory, at a summit in Cairo.The Arab plan for Gaza proposes rebuilding the Palestinian enclave without displacing its 2.4 million residents.Besides Gaza, Arab officials also discussed Syria, which only six months ago entered a new chapter in its history after the fall of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad.Earlier this week, Trump in Riyadh met Syria\u2019s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose group spearheaded the offensive that toppled al-Assad last December. Prior to their meeting, he also announced that US sanctions on Syria will be lifted in a huge boost to the government in Damascus.Al-Sharaa, who was imprisoned for years in Iraq on charges of belonging to al-Qaeda following the 2003 US-led invasion, however, missed Baghdad\u2019s summit after several powerful Iraqi politicians voiced opposition to his visit. The Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani represented Damascus instead.Saturday\u2019s summit also came amid Iran\u2019s ongoing nuclear talks with the US. Trump has pursued diplomacy with Iran as he seeks to stave off a threatened military strike by Israel on Iran, a desire shared by many of the region\u2019s leaders.On Thursday, Trump said a deal was \u201cgetting close\u201d, but by Friday, he was warning that \u201csomething bad is going to happen\u201d if the Iranians do not move fast.Iraq has only recently regained a semblance of normalcy after decades of devastating conflict and turmoil, and its leaders view the summit as an opportunity to project an image of stability.Reporting from Baghdad, Al Jazeera\u2019s Mahmoud Abdelwahed said the summit was \u201cvery crucial\u201d for Iraq.\u201cThis is the first time the summit has been held in Iraq since 2012 and Iraq takes it as a credit to regain its rule as a player to bridge the gap between member states of the Arab League,\u201d he said."}

The word \u201chistoric\u201d was used more than a few times by US officials to describe the visits.With Trump returning to the White House, here are five key takeaways from his trip:Addressing an investment summit in Riyadh, Trump promoted a realist approach to the Middle East \u2014 one in which the US does not intervene in the affairs of other countries.He took a swipe at neoconservatives who oversaw the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as he lauded Gulf leaders for developing the region.\u201cThis great transformation has not come from Western intervention or flying people in beautiful planes, giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs,\u201d he said.\u201cThe gleaming marbles of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called nation-builders, neo-cons or liberal nonprofits like those who spent trillions and trillions of dollars failing to develop Kabul, Baghdad, so many other cities.\u201dTrump built his political brand with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d slogan, calling for the US to focus on its own issues instead of helping \u2014 or bombing \u2014 foreign countries.But his words at the investment summit marked a stern rebuke of the neo-cons who dominated Trump\u2019s Republican Party a decade ago.\u201cIn the end, the so-called nation-builders wrecked far more nations than they built, and the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves,\u201d Trump said.It is rare for US presidents to travel to the Middle East and not visit Israel, but Trump omitted the US ally from his itinerary as he toured the region.Skipping Israel was seen as a reflection of the deteriorating ties between the US administration and the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.This week\u2019s trip also came in the context of several moves perceived as evidence of the US marginalising Israel. The US has continued to hold talks with Israel\u2019s rival Iran, announced a ceasefire with the Houthis in Yemen, and conducted unilateral negotiations to release Israeli soldier Edan Alexander, a US citizen, from Hamas captivity.Moreover, while touring the Gulf, Trump did not use his remarks to prioritise the establishment of formal diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which had been a top goal during his first term.It remains unclear how Trump\u2019s decisions will affect the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the two allies, but experts say it is becoming increasingly apparent that the US no longer views the Middle East solely through the lens of Israel.\u201cIs it a tactical problem for Netanyahu and the entire pro-Israel lobby? I think it is,\u201d Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University, said of Trump\u2019s shift.\u201cIt does throw a wrench in the machinery because it is a president who is showing openly daylight with Israeli decision-making, and not just in rhetoric, but acting on it \u2014 leaving Israel out of the process.\u201dWith that chasm emerging, some Palestinian rights advocates had hoped that the US president\u2019s trip to the region would see Washington pursue a deal to end Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.But as Trump marvelled at the luxurious buildings in the Gulf, Israel intensified its bombardment to destroy what\u2019s left of the Palestinian territory.No ceasefire was announced, despite reports of continuing talks in Doha. And Israel appears to be pushing forward with its plan to expand its assault on Gaza as it continues to block aid for the nearly two million people in the enclave, leading to fears of famine.United Nations experts and rights groups have described the situation as a genocide.But despite preaching \u201cpeace and prosperity\u201d for both Israelis and Palestinians, Trump made no strong push to end the war during this week\u2019s trip.On Thursday, Trump suggested that he has not given up on the idea of depopulating Gaza and turning it over to the US \u2014 a proposal that legal experts say amounts to ethnic cleansing.\u201cI have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good. Make it a freedom zone,\u201d he said. \u201cLet the United States get involved, and make it just a freedom zone.\u201dIn a move that surprised many observers, Trump announced from Riyadh that he will offer sanction relief to Syria, as the country emerges from a decade-plus civil war.Trump also met with interim Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa and described him as a \u201cyoung, attractive guy\u201d.A wholesale lifting of sanctions was not expected, in part because of Israel\u2019s hostility to the new authorities in Syria. Israeli officials often describe al-Sharaa, who led al-Qaeda\u2019s branch in Syria before severing ties with the group, as a \u201cterrorist\u201d.But Trump said he made the decision to lift the economic penalties against Syria at the request of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkiye\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\u201cI will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,\u201d the US president said.The White House said on Wednesday that Trump had a list of requests for al-Sharaa, including establishing diplomatic relations with Israel and deporting \u201cPalestinian terrorists\u201d.Removing US sanctions, which had been imposed on the government of former President Bashar al-Assad, is likely to be a boost for the new Syrian authorities, who are grappling with an ailing economy after years of conflict.\u201cLifting sanctions on Syria represents a fundamental turning point,\u201d Ibrahim Nafi Qushji, an economist, told Al Jazeera.\u201cThe Syrian economy will transition from interacting with developing economies to integrating with more developed ones, potentially significantly reshaping trade and investment relations.\u201dIn Saudi Arabia, Trump declared that he wants a deal with Iran \u2014 and he wants it done quickly.\u201cWe really want them to be a successful country,\u201d the US president said of Iran.\u201cWe want them to be a wonderful, safe, great country, but they cannot have a nuclear weapon. This is an offer that will not last forever. The time is right now for them to choose.\u201dTrump warned Iran that, if it rejects his \u201colive branch\u201d, he would impose a \u201cmassive maximum pressure\u201d against Tehran and choke off its oil exports.Notably, Trump did not threaten explicit military action against Iran, a departure from his previous rhetoric. In late March, for instance, he told NBC News, \u201cIf they don\u2019t make a deal, there will be bombing.\u201dIran says it is not seeking nuclear weapons and would welcome a stringent monitoring programme of its nuclear facilities.But Israel and some hawks want the Iranian nuclear programme completely dismantled, not just scaled back.US and Iranian officials have held multiple rounds of talks this year, but Tehran says it has not received an official offer from Washington. And Trump officials have not explicitly indicated what the endgame of the talks is.US envoy Steve Witkoff said last month that Iran \u201cmust stop and eliminate\u201d uranium enrichment, but days earlier, he had suggested that enrichment should be brought down to civilian energy levels.Several Gulf countries, including the three that Trump visited this week, have welcomed the nuclear negotiations, as relations between Iran and its Arab neighbours have grown more stable in recent years.Before entering politics, Trump was a real estate mogul who played up his celebrity persona as a mega-rich dealmaker. He appears to have brought that business mindset to the White House.While in the wealthy Gulf region, Trump was in his element. He announced deals that would see Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE buy US arms and invest in American firms. According to the White House, Trump secured a total of $2 trillion in investments from the Middle East during the trip.And his administration is framing the deals as a major political and economic victory for Trump.\u201cWhile it took President Biden nearly four years to secure $1 trillion in investments, President Trump achieved this in his first month, with additional investment commitments continuing to roll in,\u201d the White House said.\u201cPresident Trump is accelerating investment in America and securing fair trade deals around the world, paving the way for a new Golden Age of lasting prosperity for generations to come.\u201d"}

The extent of any damage was not clear, and there no immediate reports of casualties.The Houthis have carried out a campaign of attacks against Israel in self-proclaimed solidarity with Palestinians after Israel launched its assault on Gaza in October 2023.Israel has carried out strikes in response, including one on May 6 that damaged Yemen\u2019s main airport in Sanaa and killed several people.Friday\u2019s attacks were the first since US President Donald Trump agreed to a ceasefire deal with the Houthis earlier this month, with the US halting its attacks on Yemen and the group agreeing to end its attacks on shipping lanes in the Red Sea.Israel was not included in that agreement, and its military said it intercepted several missiles fired from Yemen towards Israeli airspace this week.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday that the attacks are \u201cjust the beginning\u201d, describing the Houthis as \u201cjust a tool\u201d, alleging that Iran was \u201cbehind them\u201d.\u201cWe will not stand idly by and allow the Houthis to harm us. We will strike them with greater force, including at their leadership and all the infrastructure that enables them to attack us,\u201d he said in a statement posted on the government\u2019s social media account.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz pledged to \u201chunt down and eliminate\u201d Houthi leader Abdel-Malik al-Houthi if the rebel group continued \u201cto fire missiles at the State of Israel\u201d.Alluding to recent Houthi attacks on Israel, Katz indicated leader al-Houthi would meet the same fate as Hamas commanders Mohammed Deif and Yahya Sinwar in Gaza, Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon \u2013 all killed in Israeli attacks over the last year.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Jordan\u2019s capital Amman, said that since Israel broke a ceasefire agreement with Hamas back in March \u2013 killing almost 3,000 since then, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry \u2013 the Houthis had launched \u201cat least 34 different projectiles\u201d towards Israel.She said that Israel\u2019s policy \u201cmoving forward\u201d would be to strike back. \u201cFor every missile that\u2019s fired, they\u2019re going to be conducting these types of air strikes,\u201d she said."}

The last week has shown the opposite, an intensification of violence across the besieged Palestinian territory, leaving hundreds dead, and hundreds of thousands terrified of what comes next.This was a week where United States President Donald Trump toured the Middle East, visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. There had been hope that some kind of ceasefire deal would be announced, or that the US would put more pressure on Israel to seriously come to the negotiating table. That was particularly the case after Hamas released a US-Israeli captive on Monday without demanding anything in exchange.Ultimately, none of that happened, with Trump returning to his idea of US involvement in the future administration of whatever is left of Gaza, while acknowledging that Palestinians there were starving.Israel also intercepted a number of missiles fired by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, before attacking Yemen itself on Friday.Lets take a closer look at a week that has devastated Gaza, and left Palestinians there feeling even more abandoned.According to figures compiled by Al Jazeera, at least 370 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since Sunday. The violence has been particularly deadly in the second half of the week, with medical sources reporting the killing of at least 100 Palestinians on Friday, and 143 on Thursday. Many of those killed have been women and children.These are some of the worst single-day death tolls since the beginning of the war in October 2023.The killings put the total death toll reported by the Gaza Ministry of Health more than 53,000, although the territory\u2019s Government Media Office\u2019s death toll now sits at more than 61,700, as it includes thousands of Palestinians still under the rubble who are presumed dead.Israeli attacks have targeted the whole Gaza Strip, with a particular focus on the north. Hospitals have also repeatedly been bombed by Israel.The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has been caused by Israel\u2019s complete blockade of the entry of all food and medication to the Strip since March 2, a decision it made when the ceasefire was still ongoing, and one that goes against international law.A report released on Monday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) initiative said that the Gaza Strip was \u201cstill confronted with a critical risk of famine\u201d, with half a million people facing starvation and 93 percent of its more than 2 million population at severe risk.People are already starving to death \u2013 Gaza authorities last week said that 57 people had died as a result of starvation.Trump acknowledged that \u201ca lot of people are starving\u201d in Gaza and said that the US was \u201cgoing to get that taken care of\u201d, but provided few details. The US has backed a new body called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that it says will start work in Gaza by the end of the month.But the plan has been rejected by the United Nations and other humanitarian groups, who say that the plan would lead to more displacement for Palestinians in Gaza, as it would only disperse aid in some areas of Gaza, and set a dangerous precedent for the delivery of aid in warzones.The UN has reiterated that it has the capacity to deliver aid across Gaza, but is being prevented from doing so by Israel. It says it has enough aid ready to deliver to feed all of the Palestinians in Gaza for four months, if Israel allows its trucks in.Palestinians in Gaza have been recounting the horrors of the past week, desperately calling for the world to act and stop Israel\u2019s bombing.In northern Gaza\u2019s Jabalia refugee camp, one of the worst hit areas, one civilian had a simple message \u2013 \u201ceither kill us or let us live.\u201d\u201cAll of [the strikes] were targeting civilians. All the houses are being bombed \u2013 everything is gone,\u201d Ahmed Mansour told Al Jazeera. \u201cWhat is a person supposed to do? They\u2019re all making a joke out of us. I\u2019m heading to the coast now. We\u2019ve been displaced more than 50 times \u2013 either kill us or let us live.\u201dTaher al-Nunu, a senior Hamas official, also called on Friday for the US to put more pressure on Israel to open the crossings into Gaza and \u201callow the immediate entry of humanitarian aid \u2013 food, medicine and fuel \u2013 to the hospitals in the Gaza Strip\u201d.The Israeli government has made it clear that it is unwilling to agree to a deal that would end the war in return for the release of all the Israeli captives still held in Gaza, despite widespread domestic support for such a deal.Instead, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks of total victory against Hamas, although it is difficult to see what that would entail.Instead, the war drags on, and Netanyahu said on Monday that preparations were continuing for \u201can intensification of the fighting\u201d. Last week, he said that Israel was planning for the \u201ctotal conquest\u201d of Gaza.Trump left the Middle East this week with no ceasefire deal agreed, only saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to find out pretty soon\u201d when asked whether a deal was in place for the return of Israel\u2019s captives.Meanwhile, the Israeli newspaper Ha\u2019aretz reported that Israel\u2019s position was \u201crigid\u201d and that the US had \u201clost interest\u201d. A source told the newspaper that US envoy Steve Witkoff was \u201cno longer involved\u201d.\u201cHe\u2019s waiting to hear what we want, and since we don\u2019t want anything, he has nothing left to do,\u201d the source said."}

The Israeli military has not commented on the strikes.Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated a promise to push ahead with a promised escalation in pursuit of his aim to destroy Hamas, the Palestinian armed group that governs Gaza.That follows an announcement by Netanyahu last week that the military campaign would be intensified should Hamas fail to agree a deal to release the remaining captives by the time United States President Donald Trump finished his tour of the Middle East.Trump was due to wrap up his four-day trip, which did not include a visit to Israel or Palestine, on Friday.There had been hope that the tour could help usher in a ceasefire deal or renewal of aid to Gaza. The humanitarian crisis in the enclave is building with an Israeli blockade of the territory now in its third month.However, Israeli officials suggested last week that plans include the \u201cconquest\u201d and full military occupation of the entire Gaza Strip, and potentially a bid to push Palestinians out of the enclave \u2013 a suggestion also put forward by Trump.Israel\u2019s war on Gaza has killed at least 53,010 Palestinians and wounded 119,919, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health. The Strip\u2019s Government Media Office has updated its death toll to more than 61,700, saying thousands of others missing under the rubble are presumed dead.Israel has halted the entry of food, medication and all other essentials into Gaza since March 2, saying that the blockade, alongside \u201cmilitary pressure\u201d, is intended to force Hamas to free the remaining captives.However, senior Hamas official Basem Naim reiterated on Thursday the group\u2019s position that the entry of aid into Gaza is a prerequisite for any talks with Israel.\u201cAccess to food, water and medicine is a fundamental human right \u2013 not a subject for negotiation,\u201d he added.The US and Israel are preparing a plan that they say will allow the resumption of aid by an NGO, while keeping supplies out of Hamas\u2019s hands.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has said it will begin distributing aid this month. However, the United Nations and other aid organisations have ruled out involvement in the initiative, saying it does not respect the impartiality, neutrality and independence of aid operations.However, the US is pushing on, apparently keen to \u201cget involved\u201d in Gaza, as Trump put it during his trip to the region.Speaking in the United Arab Emirates on Friday, the US president said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at Gaza.

A report released by Doctors of the World (Medecins du Monde) this week states that in just 18 months, acute malnutrition in Gaza has risen to levels similar to those found in countries enduring protracted humanitarian crises spanning several decades.Starvation is when the human body is deprived of food for so long that it suffers and often dies.Estimates say the body can last up to three weeks without food, but the length of time varies between individuals.Starvation occurs over three stages. The first begins as early as when a meal is skipped, the second occurs with a prolonged period of fasting where the body uses stored fat for energy.The third, and often fatal, stage is when all stored fats have been depleted and the body turns to bone and muscle as sources of energy.Children are most vulnerable to Israel\u2019s continued blockade of essential food items.More than 9,000 children have been admitted to hospital for treatment for acute malnutrition since the start of the year, according to the United Nations.The IPC projects that between now and March 2026, nearly 71,000 children under the age of five will suffer from acute malnutrition, including 14,100 children facing severe cases of malnutrition.The effect of malnutrition on children varies, but the first 1,000 days of a child\u2019s life, which includes the pregnancy up to two years, are critical for a child\u2019s healthy development.Malnutrition leads to an out-of-proportion height-to-weight ratio, stunted growth and eventually, death.Earlier this month, at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, Dr Ahmed Abu Nasir said the situation has become worse than ever due to the blockade.\u201cChildren are in their growing stage and badly need certain nutrients, including proteins and fats,\u201d the paediatrician told Al Jazeera. \u201cThese are not available in the Gaza Strip, particularly in the north.\u201dPregnant and breastfeeding women will also need to be treated for malnutrition, with 17,000 women facing this risk.The entire population of Gaza, about 2.1 million people that remain, are facing levels of food shortages that threaten their existence.Earlier this month, Ahmad al-Najjar, a displaced Palestinian in Gaza City, told Al Jazeera, \u201cFinding a single meal has become an impossible quest.\u201dDespite large numbers of trucks carrying vital supplies piling up on the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, Palestinians in Gaza have resorted to selling rubbish to afford the eye-wateringly inflated food prices.Some 93 percent of Gaza\u2019s population is at risk of levels of food insecurity above the crisis levels indicated by the IPC. If the situation does not change, the IPC has indicated that of those 2.1 million people:In essence, in as little as a month, Gaza\u2019s entire population could be starving.The features of malnutrition and starvation are unmistakable in Gaza, with severely underweight children and babies. In children, severe protein deficiency causes fluid retention and a swollen abdomen.Food insecurity across the Gaza Strip is severely affecting all areas of the blockaded enclave.All 25 bakeries supported by the World Food Programme (WFP) closed at the beginning of April due to the lack of supplies, and food stocks for most of the 177 hot meal kitchens are reportedly exhausted.Certain governorates are experiencing more severe levels of hunger. According to the IPC:The IPC says Israel\u2019s continued blockade \u201cwould likely result in further mass displacement within and across governorates\u201d, as items essential for people\u2019s survival will be depleted.

But eventually he signed and said he hadn\u2019t committed any war crimes.\u201dIn an account of his interaction with the Israeli tourist posted on X last month, Kishi described the man as an otherwise pleasant guest and admitted to feeling a \u201clittle sorry for him\u201d.\u201cThe pledge thing made us pretty awkward, but he still greeted me every time we met,\u201d Kishi wrote.\u201cHe even held the door open for me while I was carrying my luggage. But he believed that what Israel was doing was absolutely right and thought that I was brainwashed for criticising it.\u201dGiven the number of troops deployed in Gaza, the number of casualties there, and the number of Israeli travelers abroad, it is statistically undeniable that those who have committed war crimes are walking freely in major cities and tourist destinations in the world.\u2014 Guesthouse WIND VILLA (@WindVilla) May 1, 2025The Israeli tourist, who has not been named, shared a similar version of events with an Israeli news outlet following his trip to Kyoto \u2013 although the Israeli report suggested the pledge was a \u201ccondition for check-in\u201d.\u201cIn the end, I decided to sign it because I have nothing to hide,\u201d the guest was quoted as telling Ynet News, which said the tourist had served as a combat medic in the navy reserves.\u201cThe statement is true \u2013 I did not commit any war crimes, and Israeli soldiers do not commit war crimes. I signed because I didn\u2019t want to create problems, and because this form means nothing,\u201d he was quoted as saying.Following complaints from Cohen and the Israeli embassy, Kyoto tourism authorities visited the guest house several times to carry out an investigation, Kishi said.\u201cAt least the authorities, both from the city and the Japanese government, don\u2019t think it\u2019s a violation of the Hotel Act,\u201d Kishi said, referring to the Japanese law governing public accommodations.\u201cThey are just expressing their concerns and trying to convince us to change our measures. But it\u2019s beyond their authority, so it\u2019s very indirect.\u201dKishi said he has tweaked the wording of the pledge to state that it would not affect guests\u2019 eligibility to stay at WIND VILLA, to avoid further incidents.He also clarified in a public letter to Cohen that the pledge requires \u201call guests whom our guesthouse identifies as potentially having been involved in war crimes to sign the form,\u201d including those from Burundi, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Mali, Myanmar, Palestine, Russia, Syria, and Sudan.Booking.com has suspended WIND VILLA\u2019s account since the April incident, although the Israeli guest used rival site Expedia.com to book his stay, according to Kishi.On April 28, our guesthouse was suddenly suspended by https://t.co/ALza8eLJ8e without any prior inquiry, just three days after receiving a letter from the Israeli Ambassador.\nHowever, the Israeli guest in question had used a different booking site, not https://t.co/ALza8eLJ8e. pic.twitter.com/t9Z2OJ3ghF\u2014 Guesthouse WIND VILLA (@WindVilla) May 1, 2025WIND VILLA\u2019s other accounts on booking sites, including Expedia.com, continue to operate as normal, Kishi said.The Kyoto government and Israel\u2019s embassy in Tokyo did not reply to Al Jazeera\u2019s requests for comment.The Japan Times quoted a city official as saying WIND VILLA had not violated Japanese law, but the pledge was \u201cinappropriate\u201d.Booking.com told Al Jazeera that the company\u2019s mission \u201cis to make it easier for everyone to experience the world, and we do not tolerate discrimination of any kind\u201d.\u201cWe have temporarily suspended this property so that we can investigate the matter further,\u201d the spokesperson said.The WIND VILLA incident follows a similar occurrence in Kyoto last year, when a local hotel refused an Israeli man accommodation over his potential ties to Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza.The Kyoto hotel in question received verbal and written warnings from the city that it had acted illegally, according to Japan\u2019s Kyodo News.Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa told local media at the time that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for any hotel to refuse accommodation because of a guest\u2019s nationality.\u201cWe hope all visitors to Japan will be able to engage in various activities in Japan, feeling secure,\u201d she told a news conference."}

In Jabalia in northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on al-Tawbah medical clinic killed at least 15 people and wounded several others, the health ministry said.Israel\u2019s army also attacked three hospitals in north and south Gaza: al-Awda hospital in Jabalia, the Indonesian Hospital in Khan Younis, and the European hospital, which Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry says is now out of service.Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah, described \u201canother bloody day\u201d in Gaza, as Israel intensified its air attacks on residential areas.\u201cIsraeli warplanes directly targeted nine houses without any warning in the city of Khan Younis,\u201d he said, adding that entire families were \u201ccompletely wiped out\u201d.He described the situation as chaotic, with civilians fleeing repeated forced evacuation orders. \u201cThe Israeli military targeted civilians while they were asleep,\u201d launching 13 air raids on the Jabalia refugee camp and nearby areas. Civil defence teams, he added, were overwhelmed and struggling to rescue those trapped under the rubble, due to a lack of equipment.Abu Azzoum said the strikes reflect a \u201cpattern of attacks not aimed at military targets, but at systematically destroying Gaza\u2019s social fabric\u201d.Hamas said in a statement that Israel was making a \u201cdesperate attempt to negotiate under cover of fire\u201d as indirect ceasefire talks take place between Israel and Hamas, involving US envoys and Qatar and Egyptian mediators in Doha.The latest killings come amid new waves of forced displacement. Thousands fled Gaza City on Thursday after the Israeli military issued forced evacuation orders the day before.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hani Mahmoud reported scenes of panic and fear as residents packed their belongings and tried to escape the expected onslaught.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing families carrying their belongings and taking to the streets,\u201d Mahmoud said. \u201cThe children and elderly are carrying whatever they\u2019re able to carry \u2026 They don\u2019t know where to go. There is no safe place for these people \u2013 the so-called shelters have already been destroyed by Israeli bombs.\u201dSpeaking to Al Jazeera, displaced Palestinian Hasan Moqbel described the continuing assault as a war on civilians. \u201cThey have been bombing Gaza for 19 months. What\u2019s left in Gaza? Innocent children are dying. There is no armed activity here. Most of them are elderly people who are dying,\u201d he said.The attacks come as Palestinians mark the 77th anniversary of the Nakba, or catastrophe, when more than 750,000 Palestinians were forcibly expelled by Zionist paramilitary groups during the creation of Israel in 1948.Regarding the wider mood in Gaza on Nakba Day, Abu Azzoum said people were \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about a potential expansion of Israeli ground operations. \u201cThey believe the Israeli army may force them to flee again \u2013 to new areas where conditions are even worse.\u201dDespite international diplomacy, \u201cthere is no sign of a slowdown on the ground,\u201d he warned.Elsewhere in the region, President Donald Trump concluded a visit to Qatar on Thursday, where Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani urged the leader of the United States to use his influence to help secure a ceasefire in Gaza.\u201c\u200aOur teams are engaged in intensive diplomacy to secure a ceasefire in Gaza to protect all civilians, especially innocent women and children, and ensure the release of all hostages,\u201d Al Thani said during a state dinner on Wednesday.\u201cThis conflict is the key to wider stability in the region. From the West Bank to Yemen to Lebanon, and time is short,\u201d the Qatari leader said.\u201cMr President, your involvement could catalyse a breakthrough where others have stalled. But only if done in concert with serious partners \u2026 The United States brings power, leverage, and global weight. If we act together, we have a real shot at ending the bloodshed and restoring regional confidence,\u201d he added.Trump on Thursday reiterated his radical vision for the future of Gaza, suggesting Washington should take control of the besieged territory.\u201cI have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good, make it a freedom zone, let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone.\u201dTrump\u2019s comments come as Israel\u2019s war on Gaza continues to escalate, with the enclave suffering unprecedented levels of destruction and civilian casualties.The US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, spoke to Al Jazeera\u2019s diplomatic editor James Bays this week and \u201cpainted a positive picture on a deal on Gaza\u201d, with a potential agreement being reached \u201cpretty soon\u201d.When asked whether Witkoff was referring only to aid access \u2013 given that aid is currently completely blocked for the people of Gaza, with no food or medicine getting in \u2013 or to a ceasefire, he replied, \u201cAll of it, I\u2019m positive about all that.\u201dMeanwhile, the Israeli government appears to be laying the groundwork for a parallel escalation in the occupied West Bank.Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a key figure in Israel\u2019s far-right coalition, has openly called for military forces to destroy Palestinian towns and villages in the West Bank, echoing the destruction witnessed in Gaza.\u201cJust as we are flattening Rafah, Khan Younis and Gaza, we have to flatten the terror hubs,\u201d Smotrich said, referring specifically to the Palestinian village of Bruqin, where an Israeli settler was killed on Wednesday evening.Israeli forces launched new raids across the occupied West Bank at dawn on Thursday, storming cities and refugee camps including Tubas, Nablus, Bethlehem and Dura. Residents in Qalandiya, Ya\u2019bad, Fawwar and Askar camps also reported house raids, arrests and what rights groups describe as systematic abuse.Later, Israel\u2019s military said it killed five Palestinians and arrested a sixth who had barricaded themselves in a building in Tammun, about 35km (22 miles) from Bruqin, following an exchange of fire with soldiers.The military wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group issued a statement saying five of its members were killed while clashing with Israeli forces that surrounded their house in the town of Tammun."}

Humanitarian and United Nations aid groups have said that they already have the means of delivering aid to Gaza but are being blocked from doing so by Israel.Israel has completely cut off Gaza\u2019s access to food, water, fuel, and humanitarian aid since March 2, prompting global monitors of extreme hunger to warn of possible famine and allegations of the use of starvation as a weapon of war by human rights groups.Israel has claimed, with little evidence, that members of the armed Palestinian group Hamas are stealing large portions of aid entering the Strip, and have pushed for the exclusion of UN organisations, long viewed with ire by Israeli authorities, from aid distribution.A newly created body with US backing called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said on Wednesday that it would begin operations in Gaza by the end of May, and that it has asked Israel to allow increased levels of aid into the Strip.Critics have said that the new organisation fulfils an Israeli goal of sidelining the UN and independent international organisations from aid distribution in Gaza.\u201cGHF emphasizes that a successful humanitarian response must eventually include the entire civilian population in Gaza,\u201d the foundation\u2019s executive director, Jake Wood, wrote in a letter to the Israeli government.\u201cGHF respectfully requests that the [Israeli military] identify and deconflict sufficient locations in northern Gaza capable of hosting GHF-operated secure distribution sites that can be made operational within 30 days,\u201d he added.A recent report by the Observer, a UK-based news outlet, notes that a GHF fundraising document appears to mirror claims about the problems of humanitarian assistance in Gaza that do not include the actions of the Israeli government itself and instead blame a \u201ccollapse\u201d of \u201ctraditional humanitarian channels\u201d due to aid diversion and combat operations.Thousands of aid trucks have been bottlenecked outside of Gaza amid Israel\u2019s blockade for weeks, with UN officials stressing that they are ready and capable of resuming aid distribution in the Strip, if Israel will lift the siege."}

The question will likely eventually be decided by the US Supreme Court.The administration has further relied on the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to justify its actions. An obscure provision of the law allows the US secretary of state to deport any non-citizen deemed to have \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign consequences\u201d.In a separate ruling related to Columbia University Student Mahmoud Kahlil in April, a federal judge adopted a broad interpretation of the provision, saying Kahlil was deportable based on Rubio\u2019s claims he took part in \u201canti-Semitic\u201d protests. That came despite the top US diplomat providing no further evidence.Similarly, the Department of Homeland Security had previously claimed in a post on X that Khan Suri was \u201cspreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media\u201d.It added he \u201cwas married to the daughter of a senior advisor for to Hamas terrorist group\u201d.But speaking to reporters, Nermeen Arastu, one of the lawyers representing Khan Suri, noted that evidence backing up those claims has not been presented by government lawyers in court.Arastu, who is also an associate professor of law at the CUNY School of Law, said it was notable that \u201cthe court today also pointed out that the government is kind of throwing around accusations in social media, but not presenting them in the formal courtroom setting\u201d.\u201cAnd tied that to this due process concept that\u2019s so important here to understand \u2013 that at the very basic level, you have a right to understand the allegations that are being brought against you,\u201d she said.Critics have further accused the Trump administration of targeting Khan Suri based on his familial ties. His wife is the daughter of Ahmed Yousef, a former adviser to assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh who left his position with the armed group more than a decade ago.\u201cHe should have never been arrested and jailed for his constitutionally protected speech just because the government disagrees with him,\u201d ACLU of Virginia senior immigrants\u2019 rights lawyer Sophia Gregg, told reporters on Wednesday.\u201cHe should have never been punished for his relationship with his wife or his father-in-law,\u201d she said.Like in the cases of Ozturk and Mahdawi, Khan Suri\u2019s cases will proceed despite his release. He faces two separate legal proceedings, one in immigration court in the one challenging his arrest and detention in Virginia.He remained in detention in Texas when the ruling was issued on Wednesday, his lawyers said, adding they were expecting him to be released shortly.Saleh said at the court that she had recently spoken to her husband from the detention centre in Texas, where he was held.\u201cHe told me if my suffering in the detention centre is because I married a Palestinian and because I spoke out against the genocide in Gaza, then I should wear it as a badge of honour,\u201d she said."}

We can\u2019t get the wounded out. Doctors can\u2019t get in. What he\u2019s doing is a disgrace. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201dMacron, who visited injured Palestinians in El Arish hospital in Egypt last month, called to reopen the Gaza border to humanitarian convoys. \u201cThen, yes, we must fight to demilitarise Hamas, free the hostages and build a political solution,\u201d he said.But Netanyahu on Wednesday condemned the French leader\u2019s comments.\u201cMacron has once again chosen to stand with a murderous Islamist terrorist organisation and echo its despicable propaganda, accusing Israel of blood libels,\u201d a statement from Netanyahu\u2019s office read.Meanwhile, half a million Palestinians are facing possible starvation, living at \u201ccatastrophic\u201d levels of hunger, while one million others can barely get enough food, according to findings by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a leading international authority on the severity of hunger crises.Israel has banned all food, shelter, medicine and any other goods from entering the Palestinian territory for the past 10 weeks, even as it carries out waves of air strikes and ground operations.Gaza\u2019s population of about 2.3 million people relies almost entirely on outside aid to survive, because Israel\u2019s 19-month-old military campaign has wiped out most capacity to produce food inside the territory."}

seat as Trump announces Saudi deals", "date": "13 May 2025", "media_type": "news", "link": null, "content": "Washington, DC \u2013 United States President Donald Trump says that forging formal relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel would be a \u201cdream\u201d, but he wants the kingdom to do it on its \u201cown time\u201d.The White House on Tuesday made public a flurry of economic and defence pacts with Saudi Arabia involving hundreds of billions of dollars, but any mention of Israel was conspicuously absent from the announcements.The so-called \u201cnormalisation\u201d drive between Saudi Arabia and Israel dominated his predecessor, Joe Biden\u2019s, approach to the region, but the current US president is shifting focus elsewhere, analysts say.\u201cThe Trump administration has made it clear they are willing to move forward on key agreements with Saudi Arabia without the previous condition of Saudi-Israel normalisation,\u201d said Anna Jacobs, a non-resident fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute, a think tank.\u201cThis probably reflects growing frustration in the Trump administration with Israeli military action across the region, especially in Gaza.\u201dKristian Coates Ulrichsen, fellow for the Middle East at the Baker Institute, also said that Trump has realised that with the ongoing war in Gaza and Israel\u2019s refusal to negotiate the establishment of a Palestinian state, the \u201ctime is not right\u201d for a Saudi Arabia-Israeli pact despite Biden\u2019s emphasis on brokering a deal.\u201cI think the White House has finally acknowledged that a normalisation agreement at this time is not possible,\u201d Coates Ulrichsen told Al Jazeera.During his first term, Trump managed to broker the Abraham Accords between Israel and several Arab countries, including the United Arab Emirates, which established formal relations with the US ally independently of the Palestinian issue.However, the agreements were unsuccessful in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as evidenced by the outbreak of the war in Gaza in October 2023.But even before the war started, Israel had been intensifying its military raids against Palestinians and expanding illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank, further dimming the prospects of a two-state solution to the conflict.Despite the agreements\u2019 apparent shortcomings, Biden made adding Saudi Arabia to the Abraham Accords a focal point of his Middle East agenda, and US officials said they worked on securing a deal up until the final days of the administration, even as the war on Gaza was raging.Biden has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that Hamas launched its October 7 attack against Israel in 2023 to thwart an agreement between the Saudis and Israelis.Still, a day before he left office, Biden boasted that his Middle East policies created an opportunity for \u201cthe future of normalisation and integration of Israel with all its Arab neighbours, including Saudi Arabia\u201d.US officials and media reports said that Biden\u2019s deal, which never materialised, would have brought a security pact between Riyadh and Washington and provided US help for Saudi Arabia to establish a civil nuclear programme in exchange for normalisation with Israel.A major sticking point in that push has been the widely stated Saudi Arabian support for the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, which conditions recognition of Israel on the establishment of a viable Palestinian state.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has categorically rejected the \u201cland for peace\u201d framework, pushing instead for deals with Arab countries that bypass Palestinians.\u201cThis Israeli government won\u2019t even provide lip service to the idea of a two-state solution, making it pretty impossible for Saudi Arabia to seriously consider moving forward with normalisation,\u201d said Jacobs from the Arab Gulf States Institute.\u201cThe Trump administration seems to have understood that it\u2019s off the table, at least for now.\u201dIn Riyadh, Trump announced an agreement to deepen security cooperation with Saudi Arabia.The $142bn deal will provide Saudi Arabia with \u201cstate-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services\u201d from US firms, the White House said.It also includes \u201cextensive training and support to build the capacity of the Saudi armed forces, including enhancement of Saudi service academies and military medical services\u201d, it added.While the weapons and training deals fall short of a NATO-like mutual defence pact, which may have been included as part of an accord with Israel, they take a bite from the US-backed carrots offered to the kingdom for normalisation, experts say.\u201cThe announcements today do further deepen the links between Saudi and US security and defence interests,\u201d Coates Ulrichsen said.Trump\u2019s visit to the region comes as Israel has promised to not just continue, but expand, its devastating war on Gaza, which has killed more than 52,900 Palestinians, according to health authorities.Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University, noted that Riyadh has described Israeli atrocities in Gaza as a \u201cgenocide\u201d.\u201cThe Saudis are not mincing their words; they are not holding back,\u201d Elgindy told Al Jazeera. \u201cThey can\u2019t now move toward normalisation with Israel after accusing Israel of genocide. That would just be ridiculous.\u201dAfter his trip to Saudi Arabia, Trump will head to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates as part of the first planned foreign trips of his presidency, since attending Pope Francis\u2019s funeral last month. Israel is not on the itinerary.For Coates Ulrichsen and others, Trump\u2019s apparent snub of Israel reflects unease in the US-Israeli alliance.\u201cIt may be a signal that the White House sees much more value in deepening commercial and strategic relationships with the Gulf states at the moment, given that Israel remains mired in conflict,\u201d Coates Ulrichsen told Al Jazeera.Tensions between the Trump administration and Netanyahu\u2019s government have become more apparent in recent weeks despite the US\u2019s military and diplomatic backing of Israel.Trump confirmed talks with Iran over its nuclear programme during Netanyahu\u2019s visit to the White House, despite the Israeli leader\u2019s opposition to negotiations with Tehran.Last week, the US president also declared a ceasefire with the Houthis. The deal did not demand an end to the Yemeni group\u2019s attacks against Israel.As Trump spoke in Riyadh on Tuesday, the Houthis fired another missile at Israel \u2013 part of a campaign they say aims to pressure an end to the war on Gaza.The Trump administration also worked with mediators in Qatar and Egypt to secure the release of US citizen Edan Alexander, who served in the Israeli military and was captured by Hamas during the October 7 attack on Israel. According to Israeli media reports, Israel was excluded from those talks.Elgindy from Georgetown University said the apparent tensions are more than a \u201cbump in the road\u201d, but their impact on the US-Israeli relationship remains to be seen.\u201cTrump is making clear in word and deed that US and Israeli interests are not one and the same,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s very significant because Biden didn\u2019t do that.\u201dFor now, Trump remains committed to US military aid to Israel even as it intensifies its bombardment and starvation campaign in Gaza.And the US president has pushed on with his crackdown on critics of Israel at home, especially on college campuses.Still, experts say that by skipping Israel during his Middle East trip and de-prioritising normalisation, Trump is pushing forward in pursuit of his own vision for the region.On Tuesday, Trump lauded Gulf leaders whom he said are building a Middle East \u201cwhere people of different nations, religions and creeds are building cities together \u2013 not bombing each other out of existence\u201d.That future seems at odds with what Israel appears to be seeking: asserting hegemony over the region with long-term bombing campaigns, including in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.\u201cA very strong signal is being sent that a stable, prosperous Middle East \u2013 represented, in the administration\u2019s views, by the Gulf states \u2013 is a much more desirable outcome than maybe the Israeli view of the Middle East at the moment, which is one of seemingly escalating a forever conflict,\u201d said Coates Ulrichsen."}

The air strikes followed a warning by Israel\u2019s military for Palestinians in the flee the area to flee.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there\u2019s \u201cno way\u201d Israel will halt its war on Gaza even if a deal is reached to release more captives held in the besieged and bombarded territory. He has threatened  an all-out military assault  in the coming days.French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday denounced Netanyahu\u2019s policy in Gaza. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is shameful\u201d, he said during an interview on TF1 television, adding that European nations should consider sanctions.Earlier on Tuesday, Israel\u2019s army admitted to carrying out \u201ca targeted attack\u201d on the Nasser Medical Complex, also in Khan Younis, killing two people, including Palestinian journalist Hassan Eslaih.Gaza\u2019s Government Media Office confirmed the killing of Eslaih, who was receiving treatment at the hospital\u2019s burn unit for severe injuries sustained during an April 7 Israeli strike on a media tent located next to the hospital.AFP news agency footage taken from Nasser Medical Complex after Tuesday\u2019s strike showed smoke rising from the facility as rescuers searched through the rubble by the light of torches.A hospital worker who gave his name as Abu Ghali said the Israeli bombardment \u201cdoes not differentiate between civilians and military targets\u201d.\u201cThis is a civilian hospital that receives injured people around the clock,\u201d he told AFP.Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, said Israel\u2019s attack on Nasser Hospital marked the second time in seven weeks the same building was targeted.\u201cAfter the first attack seven weeks ago, we had to move our burn unit to a nearby building, where we now treat severe burns, trauma injuries and run two surgical theatres,\u201d MSF said. \u201cFollowing today\u2019s attack, outpatient consultations are suspended, and the number of our colleagues in the facility is reduced.\u201dEslaih was the director of the Alam24 News Agency and a freelancer who contributed to international news organisations, including photos of the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel.Israel has claimed Eslaih was a Hamas fighter who participated in the attacks, an allegation he vehemently denied.At least 178 journalists and media workers have been killed in Palestine, Israel and Lebanon since the war began, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Gaza\u2019s Government Media Office put the death toll at 215.Israel\u2019s military said in a post on Telegram that the strike targeted a Hamas \u201ccommand and control complex\u201d at Nasser, the largest hospital in southern Gaza, without providing evidence.\u201cThe compound was used by the terrorists to plan and execute terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians and troops,\u201d the post said, in what appeared to be a reference to Eslaih and Hamas.Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry condemned \u201cthe repeated targeting of hospitals and the pursuit and killing of wounded patients inside treatment rooms\u201d, saying it \u201cconfirms Israel\u2019s deliberate intent to inflict greater damage to the healthcare system\u201d.Hospitals in Gaza have been a frequent target of Israeli attacks since the war began in October 2023 although attacking health facilities, medical personnel and patients is illegal under the 1949 Geneva Conventions.According to officials in Gaza, Israel has bombed and burned at least 36 hospitals across the enclave since the war erupted."}

The parts, however, would not be sent directly to Israel, the government said.Al-Haq and GLAN argue that the government is breaking domestic and international law through a loophole by allowing the parts to be supplied to Israel via the global spares pool and F-35 partner countries, \u201cdespite the [International Court of Justice] finding that there is plausible risk of genocide being committed against Palestinians in Gaza\u201d.The UK reportedly provides about 15 percent of the components in the F-35 fighter jets used by Israel.The case has taken on new significance after a report last week by the Palestinian Youth Movement, Progressives International and Workers for a Free Palestine suggested F-35 parts are still being sent directly to Israel as of March 2025.\u201cDespite the September 2024 suspension of direct shipments of F-35 components from the UK to Israel, the data suggest such shipments are ongoing as of March 2025\u201d, the report said, citing Israeli tax authority data.From Tuesday until Friday, High Court judges will examine whether the government\u2019s decision to suspend some but not all arms licences for export to Israel was legally correct.Al Jazeera understands the judicial review will focus on the carve-out for F-35 jet parts. The campaigners have said they aim to ensure the UK government \u201curgently suspends all arms exports to Israel\u201d, while accusing the UK of \u201ccomplicity\u201d in Israel\u2019s genocide against Palestinians.Co-claimants Al-Haq and GLAN applied for a judicial review into arms export licences to Israel in December 2023, citing violations carried out by Israel against Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.They say F-35 jets have plausibly been involved in war crimes.\u201cWe know Israel is using the F-35 jets to bomb civilians. For example [in] the attack on March 18 which broke the ceasefire, and this wouldn\u2019t be possible without the UK\u2019s help,\u201d Walker said.\u201cHundreds of civilians died,\u201d Walker said, referring to one of the deadliest days across Gaza when Israeli assaults killed more than 400 people. \u201cWe know every F-35 jet has some British parts.\u201dIn a statement sent to Al Jazeera, a spokesperson with the UK\u2019s Foreign Office said, \u201cThis government has suspended relevant licences for the [Israeli army] that might be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza.\u201dThe spokesperson added that of the remaining licences for Israel, the \u201cvast majority\u201d are not for the Israeli army but for \u201ccivilian purposes or re-export, and therefore are not used in the war in Gaza\u201d.The spokesperson reiterated the government\u2019s position that the F-35 programme exemption was \u201cdue to its strategic role in NATO and wider implications for international peace and security\u201d, adding that \u201cany suggestion that the UK is licensing other weapons for use by Israel in the war in Gaza is misleading\u201d.Oxfam, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are assisting the case by submitting written evidence.Oxfam\u2019s intervention is based on its documentation of the destruction caused by Israeli fire on water sanitation and health facilities.Akshaya Kumar, the director of crisis advocacy at Human Rights Watch, raised the idea of criminal responsibility, referencing the Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal.\u201cIf you are a supplier, you are aiding and abetting the continued assault, the continued air strikes. You are part of that criminal responsibility,\u201d she said.Elizabeth Rghebi, the MENA advocacy director at Amnesty International USA, argued that several states have either been unwilling to observe international legal obligations or have claimed that the structure of the F-35 programme makes it impossible to apply arms controls to the end-user, \u201cwhich would make the entire programme incompatible with international law\u201d.Israel\u2019s latest military assault on Gaza began shortly after October 7, 2023, when Hamas, the group that governs the Strip, led an incursion into southern Israel, during which 1,139 people were killed and more than 200 were taken captive.Israel has failed to achieve its stated aim of crushing Hamas, while its aerial bombardment from jets, including the F-35, has decimated civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, universities, libraries, mosques and churches.Emeritus professor Paul Rogers from the University of Bradford said, \u201cIn terms of tonnage dropped, most modern wars have had very high levels of tonnage used. Gaza is probably one of the worst. If you go back to the Second World War \u2013 [there was] the carpet bombing of German cities, the firebombing of Japanese cities, for that matter, and, on a smaller scale, the bombing Britain experienced during the second and third years of the war.\u201dHe added: \u201cSo, it\u2019s not exceptional in that sense, but the concentration of so much firepower in a very small area is very unusual. It bears comparison with some of the worst examples of modern warfare and their impact on civilians.\u201dThe World Health Organization (WHO) has documented the woes inflicted on Gaza\u2019s healthcare sector, including the systematic destruction of hospitals, withholding of medical supplies and the detention of doctors.\u201cAirstrikes and a lack of medical supplies, food, water and fuel have virtually depleted an already under-resourced health system,\u201d the WHO said.It added that 90 percent of housing units in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged. A similar percentage of school buildings require complete reconstruction or major rehabilitation."}

An image was released showing Alexander with Hamas members and a Red Cross official.Hamas said it had released Alexander as a goodwill gesture towards US President Donald Trump, who is visiting Arab Gulf nations this week.Fighting briefly stopped to allow for the handover after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would permit safe passage for the release.\u201cEdan Alexander, American hostage thought dead, to be released by Hamas.

Families of the captives have accused Netanyahu of putting his own political survival above that of the captives still held in Gaza.In a statement, ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric welcomed Alexander\u2019s release while calling for a lasting ceasefire in Gaza.\u201cWe are relieved that one more family has been reunited today. This nightmare, however, continues for the remaining hostages, their families, and hundreds of thousands of civilians across Gaza,\u201d Spoljaric said.Alexander\u2019s mother reportedly arrived in Israel on Monday and was flown to the Re\u2019im military base, where the two were expected to be reunited later in the evening, according to Al Jazeera\u2019s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan, because Al Jazeera is banned from Israel.Despite the release, Israel has made no commitment to a broader ceasefire. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in exchange, no release of Palestinian prisoners, no pause in the fighting,\u201d Salhut said. \u201cIf there are going to be any sort of negotiations, they\u2019re going to happen under fire,\u201d Salhut added, referring to the Israeli government\u2019s prevailing line.Akiva Eldar, an Israeli political analyst, said Alexander\u2019s release has spurred joy as well as frustration in Israel. \u201cWhat we see is that what President Trump can do, Netanyahu is not able \u2013 or not willing \u2013 to do,\u201d he told Al Jazeera from Tel Aviv.The Israeli prime minister has faced widespread calls to end the Gaza war to secure the captives\u2019 release but has said he plans to expand Israel\u2019s offensive.\u201cToday is a crucial point,\u201d Eldar explained. \u201cBecause the Israeli public is aware of the fact that if you want a deal, if you want your sons back at home, you can do it. But for that, you have to be a leader like President Trump and not like Netanyahu.\u201dAl Jazeera\u2019s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said there seems to be no change forthcoming in Palestinians\u2019 daily suffering: \u201cPalestinians are devastated. They\u2019re exhausted. Palestinian families are unable to feed their children. They\u2019re saying their children are going to bed hungry.\u201d\u201cThe IPC [Integrated Food Security Phase Classification] report issued today said 93 percent of Gaza\u2019s population is living through acute food insecurity. This is because of the blockade that has been imposed on the Gaza Strip,\u201d Khoudary said.\u201cPalestinians are asking, \u2018What\u2019s next? What is this release going to bring? Are there any positive negotiations? Is there any glimpse of hope of a ceasefire?'\u201d she added.And the bombardment continues, Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health said an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter killed at least 15 people on Monday.Humanitarian organisations have warned that Gaza is on the verge of mass starvation. The IPC reported that half a million Palestinians face imminent famine.According to the IPC, 70 days after Israel blocked entry of essential supplies, \u201cgoods indispensable for people\u2019s survival are either depleted or expected to run out in the coming weeks.\u201dThe head of the UN\u2019s World Food Programme, Cindy McCain, urged immediate international action. \u201cFamilies in Gaza are starving while the food they need is sitting at the border,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we wait until after a famine is confirmed, it will already be too late for many people.\u201dCatherine Russell, Executive Director of UNICEF, also issued a stark warning. \u201cThe risk of famine does not arrive suddenly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt unfolds in places where access to food is blocked, where health systems are decimated, and where children are left without the bare minimum to survive.\u201dHunger, she added, has become \u201ca daily reality for children across the Gaza Strip\u201d.Netanyahu and his hardline government remain committed to escalating the military campaign in Gaza.Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a key coalition partner, reiterated his position that the war must continue and humanitarian aid should be blocked from entering the territory.\u201cIsrael has not committed to a ceasefire of any kind,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office said in a statement, claiming military pressure had compelled Hamas to release Alexander. Critics have countered that the release came about purely because of direct US contacts with Hamas.Netanyahu met US figures, including Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and Ambassador Mike Huckabee, on Monday. His office described the meeting as a \u201clast-ditch effort\u201d to push forward a captive-release deal before the fighting widens.Huckabee said Trump and his administration \u201chope this long-overdue release\u201d of Alexander \u201cmarks the beginning of the end to this terrible war\u201d.Israel plans to send a delegation to Doha on Tuesday for talks but made clear military operations would persist. \u201cThe prime minister made it clear that negotiations would only take place under fire,\u201d his office said."}

Approximately 93 percent of Gaza\u2019s population is experiencing acute food shortages, it added.Conditions have significantly worsened since the previous IPC report, released in October, with a higher percentage of the population facing more severe levels of food insecurity.The entire population is expected to face \u201ccrisis\u201d or worse levels of acute food insecurity if the Israeli siege persists. One in five is thought likely to face starvation between May and September.Authorities in the bombarded territory said last week that at least 57 people had starved to death as a result of Israel\u2019s blockade.Widespread acute malnutrition is anticipated, the analysis adds, especially in mostly destroyed northern Gaza and in Rafah in the southernmost part of the Strip.\ud83d\udd34 #GazaStripThe Gaza Strip\u2014approximately 2.1 million people\u2014continues facing a critical risk of Famine following 19 months of conflict, mass displacement, and humanitarian aid blockade.\ud83d\udcc9 Extreme hunger is deepening every day!\u26a0\ufe0f 1 in every 5 people faces starvation between\u2026 pic.twitter.com/z7uN9ifnpC\u2014 The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (@theIPCinfo) May 12, 2025A continued blockade \u201cwould likely result in further mass displacement within and across governorates\u201d, the report said.\u201cThe vast majority of people in the Gaza Strip would not have access to food, water, shelter, and medicine. This would exacerbate civil unrest and competition over remaining scarce resources, further eroding whatever limited community coping and support mechanisms remain.\u201dFood prices in Gaza are soaring excessively.The IPC report points to a 3,000 percent increase in the price of wheat flour since February in Deir el-Balah in central Gaza and Khan Younis in the south.The analysis calls for \u201curgent action\u201d to end the hostilities, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and protect civilians and aid workers who have been killed by the Israeli army in record numbers.According to the latest figures on Monday by Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health, Israeli forces have killed at least 52,862 Palestinians and wounded 119,648 since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel, which killed an estimated 1,139 people and resulted in more than 200 people taken captive into Gaza."}

The attack never came.Whether these erratic actions are a reaction to the announced US ceasefire remains to be seen, but many analysts have spoken of a widening rift between Netanyahu and Trump.Netanyahu has reportedly expressed his frustration with Trump\u2019s Middle East policy in private conversations.He has been publicly against the US administration\u2019s talks with Iran, claiming there is no diplomatic way to resolve differences with Tehran, yet Iran and the US have continued their talks.He went on to blame Iran for the Houthis\u2019 attacks, claiming Israel\u2019s attacks are a message to the \u201cHouthis\u2019 sponsors\u201d.Trump, for his part, has seemed unconcerned.\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting Trump didn\u2019t say anything about [Houthi] attacks on Israel, which seem to be continuing amid this escalation,\u201d Nicholas Brumfield, a Yemen analyst, told Al Jazeera.\u201cIn [this] case, it\u2019s a US drawdown because the Houthis haven\u2019t been attacking international shipping,\u201d Brumfield said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been attacking Israel. The US has been doing its thing, and the Houthis have been targeting US ships.\u201dAfter Israeli attacks on Monday and Tuesday, which killed at least three people and wounded 35 others and damaged Hodeidah Port and Sanaa Airport, the Houthis promised retaliation.The attacks \u201cwill not go unanswered\u201d, the Houthi political bureau said in a statement.That kind of statement is typical of the Houthis, who have managed to weather more than a decade of attacks by forces with far superior military capabilities.Air strikes by the US and United Kingdom on Yemen in early 2024 were unable to stop the Houthis\u2019 attacks on Red Sea traffic.Years of air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition supporting Yemen\u2019s internationally recognised government taught the Houthis to keep their military infrastructure agile, analysts told Al Jazeera.A senior US government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera that recent US attacks on the Houthis have pushed leaders underground after the killing of some key military commanders.However, unlike under US President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, the attacks under Trump have been indiscriminate and have led to more civilian deaths. More than 250 people have been killed by US attacks on Yemen since mid-March, including at least 68 people at a centre housing detained African refugees and migrants in late April.Experts told Al Jazeera that despite the increased ferocity of those attacks, the Houthis have not been deterred.\u201cThe Houthis aren\u2019t going to stop,\u201d Brumfield said.The Houthis have made their stance clear vis-\u00e0-vis the agreement with the US and the continuation of attacks on Israel, which has also made clear that it plans to keep attacking.\u201cThe stated aim is to deter [the Houthis] or deplete their military capabilities to the point that the Houthis cannot target Israel any more, but these are both very unrealistic goals,\u201d Hannah Porter, an independent Yemen analyst, told Al Jazeera.Israel already considers that it has diminished the capabilities of two of its biggest foes, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, over the past 19 months.But trying something like that on the Houthis would be a vastly different challenge, she said.\u201cIsrael has probably not gathered the amount of intel on the Houthis that they have on Hamas or Hezbollah, so tracking and targeting leaders will be harder,\u201d Porter said.\u201cMore importantly, the geographic area is much larger in northern Yemen, meaning that there are far more potential targets.\u201d\u201cThe terrain is a factor, too,\u201d she added. \u201cNorthern Yemen is very mountainous with plenty of places to hide people and weapons.\u201dFor now, Israel and the Houthis seem intent on continuing their exchange of attacks. And the first to suffer will be the people of Yemen.Israel struck numerous targets in recent days in Yemen, including Sanaa\u2019s airport and the port in Hodeidah, which experts said is likely to exacerbate Yemen\u2019s dire humanitarian situation.Israel destroyed at least three civilian planes in the attacks.Yemen is already suffering one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises. More than 18.2 million people require humanitarian assistance and protection services, according to the United Nations.More than 17.1 million Yemenis suffer acute food shortages, and about five million are on the brink of famine.While analysts said Israel\u2019s attacks on ports will not be a \u201cknockout blow\u201d, they are among a matrix of factors that leave many Yemenis in an increasingly precarious position.\u201cThe humanitarian situation will just get worse,\u201d Raiman Al-Hamdani, a Yemen researcher with the international development company ARK, told Al Jazeera.\u201cDestroying the two main ports of northern Yemen, where the majority of the population lives, coupled with the FTO [\u201cforeign terrorist organisation\u201d] designation with cuts to the aid system around the world and the deteriorating economy \u2026 is a recipe for [unprecedented] humanitarian disaster.\u201d\u201c[Israel\u2019s attacks] are a continuation of its strategy. It\u2019s out of spite, targets civil infrastructure and the policy of creating human suffering,\u201d Al-Hamdani said.Both sides seem unwilling to stop, however.\u201cI cannot see anything quite good coming out of this unless the war Israel is waging on Gaza comes to some form of truce,\u201d Al-Hamdani said."}

Trump and Witkoff have frequently mentioned Alexander by name in the past few months.Witkoff later confirmed Hamas had agreed to release Alexander in the hopes of restarting ceasefire talks.Alexander, who grew up in the US, was taken from his military base during the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack.In its statement on Sunday, Hamas said it was willing to \u201cimmediately begin intensive negotiations\u201d that could lead to an agreement to end the war and would see Gaza under a technocratic and independent administration.\u201cThis will ensure calm and stability for many years, along with reconstruction and the end of the blockade,\u201d the group said.Qatar and Egypt, the two main mediators, welcomed Hamas\u2019 announcement, saying they considered the group\u2019s move a gesture of goodwill and an encouraging step toward the parties\u2019 return to ceasefire negotiations.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said on Sunday that the US told Israel that Hamas\u2019s freeing of Alexander would lead to negotiations for the release of more captives. The statement added that Israel\u2019s policy hasn\u2019t changed: negotiations will be conducted under fire with a continued commitment to achieving all war objectives.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan, said: \u201cIt\u2019s unclear exactly what kind of reaction the Israeli government officials had with these direct talks between Hamas and the United States, but last time they were quite angry and that\u2019s because the Israelis weren\u2019t involved and had no knowledge of those talks and the Americans hit back by saying they didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to negotiate with any of the actors involved because they were American captives held in Gaza\u201d.\u201cThere are a lot of questions from a lot of different angles, specifically from the family members of those captives, from the larger part of Israeli society who have been protesting in the thousands for more than 1.5 years, accusing Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the war for his own personal and political gain. And in fact, Israeli officials have been saying the quiet part out loud in recent weeks, saying that the captives were not the main priority for the Israeli government and that they had other goals and objectives they needed to achieve\u201d, she added.\u201cThe family members of captives say that the Israeli government is choosing land grabs over the lives of Israelis who are still being held in Gaza\u201d, she continued, referring to the Israeli government\u2019s decision to expand its offensive in Gaza with a view to reoccupying parts of the territory.Earlier on Sunday, two Hamas officials told the AFP news agency that talks were ongoing in the Qatari capital of Doha with the US and reported \u201cprogress\u201d had been made.One Hamas official, speaking about the talks with the US, said there was \u201cprogress made \u2026 notably on the entry of aid to the Gaza Strip\u201d and the potential exchange of captives for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.A second official also reported progress \u201con the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip\u201d.Israel shattered the last ceasefire, which lasted two months, on March 18, launching a major offensive in Gaza and ramping up its bombardment of the territory.It has also cut off all aid to Gaza since March 2, saying it would pressure Hamas to release the remaining captives. None have been released since the fleeting truce earlier this year, when several captives were exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.A total of 59 captives are still in Gaza, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.Starvation has taken hold across Gaza due to the Israeli blockade.Earlier this month, the Israeli government approved plans to expand its offensive in the Gaza Strip, with officials talking of retaining a long-term occupying presence there.The Health Ministry in Gaza said on Sunday that at least 2,720 people have been killed since Israel resumed its assault, bringing the overall Palestinian death toll since the war broke out to 52,829."}

Last week, the former EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell accused Israel of committing genocide.Ozturk was joined by her lawyers and two of Massachusetts\u2019s Democratic members of Congress, Senator Edward Markey and Representative Ayanna Pressley.\u201cToday is a tremendous day as we welcome you back, Rumeysa,\u201d Markey said. \u201cYou have made millions and millions of people across our country so proud of the way you have fought.\u201dOzturk\u2019s lawyers say her visa was revoked without notice and she was not allowed to contact legal counsel for more than a day after her arrest.Appearing in court via video on Friday, Ozturk spoke of her deteriorating health, including severe asthma attacks in detention, and her hopes of continuing her doctoral research on children and social media.US District Judge William Sessions granted Ozturk bail, saying she presented no flight risk or danger to the public. He found that her claim of unlawful detention raised serious constitutional questions, including potential violations of her rights to free speech and due process.Ozturk\u2019s case highlights a practice that has become common under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Foreign students have been arrested and hundreds of their student visas revoked for their pro-Palestine views.Mahmoud Khalil, who led the protests against Israel\u2019s war on Gaza at Columbia University in New York, was among the first students detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on March 8.

Two more civilians were injured in an attack on the al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, west of Rafah.In the past 24 hours, at least 23 Palestinians have been killed and 124 others injured in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip, according to the enclave\u2019s Ministry of Health.The attacks came amid Israel\u2019s continuing refusal to allow vital supplies into Gaza since March 2, leaving the enclave\u2019s 2.3 million residents dependent on a dwindling number of charity kitchens, which have been shutting down in recent days as food runs out.Reporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera\u2019s Hind Khoudary said: \u201cThere\u2019s barely food \u2026 We\u2019re talking about bakeries not operating, we\u2019re talking about zero distribution points and we\u2019re talking about only a few hot meal kitchens still operating.\u201dKhoudary said people queueing for hours would often leave empty-handed, with remaining kitchens stretching out food that would previously have fed 100 to serve up to 2,000 people.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more people dying, we\u2019re seeing more children dying due to malnutrition and the lack of food. But it\u2019s not only the lack of food, it\u2019s also the lack of medical supplies, it\u2019s the lack of fuel, cooking gas, and it\u2019s the lack of everything,\u201d she said.Among the charities shuttering operations, the United States-based World Central Kitchen said on Wednesday that it had been forced to close down because it no longer had supplies to bake bread or cook meals.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed for the blockade to be lifted.\u201cChildren are starving, and dying. Community kitchens are shutting down. Clean water is running out,\u201d it said on Friday in a post on X.The blockade is also having a devastating effect on people with chronic illnesses, depriving Palestinians who suffer from diabetes, cancer and rare conditions of life-saving medication.Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera\u2019s Hani Mahmoud said: \u201cDoctors here say the tragedy is not in what\u2019s happening, but in what is preventable.\u201d\u201cThese diseases have a treatment, but people of Gaza no longer have access to them, and they say that this is not just a failure of logistics, but of humanity,\u201d he added.Mahmoud spoke to the father of a 10-year-old boy suffering from diabetes, who said insulin was not available across northern Gaza.\u201cI spend entire days searching pharmacies, hoping to find it. Sometimes we hear that individuals might have it, so I go to their homes to barter,\u201d he said.Said al-Soudy, head of emergency in the oncology department of Gaza City\u2019s Al Helou International Hospital, told Al Jazeera: \u201cA large part of patients are struggling to find their essential medications. Without them, their health conditions deteriorate and may become life-threatening.\u201dPharmacist Rana Alsamak told Al Jazeera that Palestinians were unable to obtain medication for \u201cmultiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis, chronic illnesses and \u2026 immune-related diseases\u201d.\u201cThese conditions now go largely untreated,\u201d she said.On Friday, the US said it was establishing the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to coordinate aid deliveries into Gaza, with Israel providing military security for operations. The UN rejected the move, saying it would weaponise aid, violate principles of neutrality and cause mass displacement."}

Earlier this month, thousands of Israelis gathered outside the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv to protest against Netanyahu\u2019s decision to call up a further 60,000 reservists as part of his escalation against the bombed out and besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza, where his forces have already killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children.In mid-April, current and former members of the air force, considered one of Israel\u2019s elite units, also released a letter, claiming the war served the \u201cpolitical and personal interests\u201d of Netanyahu, \u201cand not security ones\u201d.Prompted by the air force, similar protests came from members of the navy, elite units within the military and Israel\u2019s foreign security agency, Mossad.Political and personal interests Accusations that Netanyahu is manipulating the war for his own personal ends predate the breaking of the ceasefire.In the minds of his critics, the longer the war continues, the longer Netanyahu feels he can defend himself against the numerous threats to his position and even his freedom.In addition to facing trial on numerous counts of corruption dating back to 2019, he also faces calls to hold an inquiry into the government\u2019s political failings before the October 7 attack.Netanyahu also faces accusations that members of his office have allegedly been taking payment from Qatar \u2013 the Gulf state has previously dismissed the allegations as a \u201csmear campaign\u201d intended to hinder efforts to mediate an end to the conflict.The continuation of the war allows Netanyahu to distract from those issues, while maintaining a coalition with far-right parties who have made it clear that any end to the war without total victory \u2013 which increasingly appears to include the ethnic cleansing of Gaza \u2013 would result in their departure from government, and Netanyahu\u2019s likely fall.And so there are questions about whether Netanyahu\u2019s announcement of a further escalation in Gaza, including the occupation of territory and displacement of its population, will mark an end to the conflict, or simply bog Israel down in the kind of forever war that has so far been to Netanyahu\u2019s benefit.\u2018I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re capable of occupying the territory,\u201d former US Special Forces commander, Colonel Seth Krummrich of international security firm Global Guardian told Al Jazeera, \u201cGaza is just going to soak up people, and that\u2019s before you even think about guarding northern Israel, confronting Iran or guarding the Israeli street,\u201d he said, warning of the potential shortfall in reservists.\u201cIt\u2019s also competing with a tide of growing [domestic] toxicity. When soldiers don\u2019t return home, or don\u2019t go, that\u2019s going to tear at the fabric of Israeli society. It plays out at every dinner table.\u201dStaying at home Israeli media reports suggest that part of that toxicity is playing out in the number of reservists simply not showing up for duty.The majority of those refusing service are thought to be \u201cgrey refusers\u201d. That is, reservists with no ideological objection to the mass killings in Gaza, but rather ones exhausted by repeated tours, away from their families and jobs to support a war with no clear end.Official numbers of reservists refusing duty are unknown. However, in mid-March, the Israeli national broadcaster, Kan, ran a report disputing official numbers, which claimed that more than 80 percent of those called up for duty had attended, suggesting that the actual figure was closer to 60 percent.\u201cThere has been a steady increase in refusal among reservists,\u201d a spokesperson for the organisation New Profile, which supports people refusing enlistment, said. \u201cHowever, we often see sharp spikes in response to specific shifts in Israeli government policy, such as the violation of the most recent ceasefire or public statements by officials indicating that the primary objective of the military campaign is no longer the return of hostages and \u2018destruction of Hamas\u2019, as initially claimed, but rather the occupation of Gaza, and its ethnic cleansing.\u201dAlso unaddressed is growing public discontent over the ultra-religious Haredi community, whose eight-decade exemption from military service was deemed illegal by the Supreme Court in June of last year.Despite the shortfall in reservists reporting for duty and others having experienced repeated deployments, in April, the Supreme Court requested an explanation from Netanyahu \u2013 who relies upon Haredi support to maintain his coalition \u2013 as to why its ruling had not been fully implemented or enforced.Throughout the war, Netanyahu\u2019s escalations, while often resisted by the captives\u2019 families and their allies, have been cheered on and encouraged by his allies among the far-right, many of whom claim a biblical right to the homes and land of Palestinians.The apparent conflict between the welfare of the captives and the \u201ctotal victory\u201d promised by Netanyahu has run almost as long as the conflict itself, with each moment of division seemingly strengthening the prime minister\u2019s position through the critical support of the ultranationalist elements of his cabinet.Netanyahu\u2019s position has led to conflict with politicians, including his own former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. While Gallant wasn\u2019t opposed to the war in principle \u2013 his active support for Netanyahu eventually led to him joining Netanyahu in facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for war crimes \u2013 his prioritisation of the captives put him at odds with the prime minister.The divide over priorities has meant that civility between the government and the captives\u2019 families has increasingly gone out the window, with Netanyahu generally avoiding meeting families with loved ones still captive in Gaza, and far-right politicians engaging in shouting matches with them during meetings in parliament.Division within Israeli society was not new, Professor Yossi Mekelberg of Chatham House told Al Jazeera, \u201cbut wars and conflicts deepen them\u201d.\u201cNow we have a situation where some people have served anywhere up to 400 days in the army [as reservists], while others are refusing to serve at all and exploiting their political power within the coalition to do so,\u201d Mekelberg added.\u201cElsewhere, there are ministers on the extreme right talking about \u2018sacrificing\u2019 the hostages for military gain,\u201d something Mekelberg said many regarded as running counter to much of the founding principles of the country and the Jewish faith.\u201cThere\u2019s such toxicity in public discourse,\u201d Mekelberg continued, \u201cWe see toxicity against anyone who criticises the war or the prime minister, division between the secular and the religious, and then even divisions within the religious movements.\u201d"}

At least 22 Palestinians were killed in a series of attacks on Friday, medical sources in Gaza told Al Jazeera. They include a mother and child in Al Nuseirat Refugee Camp in central Gaza, and a father and son killed in Khan Younis in the south.US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told reporters on Friday that Israel would not be involved in distributing aid in the enclave but would provide security for the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).The plan for the \u201ccharitable\u201d and \u201cnon-governmental\u201d initiative was announced on Thursday by State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce. Although few details were revealed, it appears part of a US-Israeli push to take over the distribution of aid to prevent it from being diverted by Hamas and other groups.The AP news agency reported that the newly created GHF had issued a proposal to implement a new aid distribution system, supplanting the current one run by the United Nations and other international aid agencies.Reports claim that under the proposal, private contractors will be used to secure hubs where Palestinians will be required to gather to collect supplies.Israel, which has halted the entry of all aid to Gaza since March 2, deepening the humanitarian crisis, has previously said it will not relax the blockade until a system is in place that gives it control over the distribution, insisting that supplies are used to support Hamas.The intention to sideline the UN has drawn sharp criticism from humanitarian organisations, and it is unclear if the GHF proposal will ease those concerns.\u201cThere\u2019s only one word to describe this, and this is aid-washing. This is a cynical attempt by the state of Israel and its allies \u2026 to use aid to hide the fact that what\u2019s actually going on is people are being starved into submission,\u201d Chris Gunness, a former UNWRA \u2013 the UN agency for Palestinian refugees \u2013 spokesperson, told Al Jazeera.\u201cThey\u2019re being starved as a part of the mass and illegal force displacement, which is very much part of Israel\u2019s genocidal ambitions against the Palestinians.\u201dGunness added that the proposal is also an \u201cattempt by Israel to destroy UNRWA\u201d, stating that UNRWA is the only organisation that has the infrastructure, the staff, the vehicles, the food distribution centres and warehouses \u201cto stave off mass starvation in Gaza\u201d.The US State Department\u2019s Bruce promised further announcements regarding the proposal would follow soon.\u201cI was hoping to introduce it today, but the foundation will be announcing this shortly,\u201d she said.The former executive director of the UN World Food Programme David Beasley is in talks with the US, Israel and other key players to head the GHF, reported US outlet Axis, quoting unnamed sources.Israel\u2019s blockade, implemented about two weeks before it resumed its bombardment of the enclave, has left Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million Palestinians, most of whom have been displaced multiple times, desperately short of food, fuel, and medicine.The US plan appears to be designed along similar lines to a proposal approved by Israel\u2019s security cabinet on Sunday.Under the scheme, four \u201cSecure Distribution Sites\u201d would be constructed, each intended to serve 300,000 people. Palestinians expelled from northern Gaza would be forced to relocate to reach the centres.The plan was met by sharp criticism from the UN and other aid groups, who noted that Palestinians have regularly come under attack from Israeli forces while collecting aid.Addressing those concerns, Huckabee on Friday said \u201cthe most significant danger is not doing anything\u201d and \u201cpeople dying from hunger\u201d.The aid would be \u201cdistributed effectively, but also safely\u201d, the US official insisted, according to Israeli daily Haaretz.The decision to bypass international aid agencies comes amid growing alarm over famine-like conditions in the besieged territory, where Israel\u2019s near-total blockade has cut off all essential supplies for almost three months.At least 57 Palestinians have starved to death in Gaza, with most of the victims being children, as well as the sick and elderly.UN humanitarian agency spokesperson Jens Laerke condemned the effort to dismantle existing aid structures on Tuesday.\u201cThis appears to be a deliberate attempt to weaponise the aid,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be based solely on humanitarian need.\u201d"}

It also offers the clearest picture yet of the Biden administration\u2019s political manoeuvring as public pressure mounted for accountability.Abu Akleh was a US citizen, and during her final reporting assignment, she wore both a helmet and a blue vest clearly labelled with the word \u201cpress\u201d to indicate her status as a journalist.In the aftermath of her killing, the Biden administration faced pressure to investigate the circumstances of her death and whether the shooting was intentional.But while the administration initially called for an \u201cindependent, credible investigation\u201d, it shifted its stance as the months progressed. It walked back calls for the killer to be \u201cprosecuted\u201d and eventually described the shooting as \u201cthe result of tragic circumstances\u201d.It also eased its scrutiny of the Israeli military, calling for accountability only in the form of a review of its \u201crules of engagement\u201d.The documentary Who Killed Shireen? features interviews from former Washington insiders about why the Biden administration made such a pivot. Its most damaging testimony comes from an anonymous official, who spoke with his face and voice obscured.In the film, the official claims the evidence available to the Biden administration indicated that Abu Akleh\u2019s death \u201cwas an intentional killing\u201d. He said that assessment was based on the \u201cvisual capabilities of that day\u201d and the distance between the Israeli snipers and the journalists who were shot.Another journalist, Ali al-Samoudi, was also wounded at the same time as Abu Akleh, though he survived his gunshot.\u201cWhether or not they knew it was her [Abu Akleh] or not can very well be debated, but they would have absolutely known it was a media person or a noncombatant at a minimum that [the Israeli soldier] shot and killed,\u201d the anonymous Biden official said.He added that it was his \u201cbelief\u201d that the shooter would have been able to see Abu Akleh\u2019s blue \u201cpress\u201d jacket.The official acknowledged the shift in the Biden administration\u2019s position, from viewing the shooting as \u201can intentional killing\u201d to describing it as \u201ca tragic accident\u201d. He linked that about-face to the historically close ties the US has shared with Israel.\u201cUltimately, I think what it came down to was different pressure within the administration to not try to anger the government of Israel too much, by trying to force their hand at saying they intentionally killed a US citizen,\u201d the official said.Another former US official, Andrew Miller, also spoke to filmmakers as part of the documentary. Miller served as the deputy secretary of state for Israeli-Palestinian Affairs from 2022 to 2024, and he indicated that the Biden administration had not been forthcoming about the stonewalling it faced from the Israeli government.He said the government of then-Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett refused to allow the US access to the soldier who fired the fatal shot, even for \u201cinformal\u201d questioning.Miller also cast doubt on Israeli claims that Abu Akleh was shot during a crossfire with Palestinian fighters. He explained that the Biden administration had information from the start that contradicted those claims.\u201cThe fact that the official Israeli position remains that this was a case of crossfire \u2026 [that] the entire episode was a mistake \u2014 as opposed to potentially a mistake in identification or the deliberate targeting of this individual \u2014 points to, I think, a broader policy of seeking to manage the narrative,\u201d Miller said.The Biden administration had never publicly contradicted Israel\u2019s assessment. Instead, when the Israeli military released its final report on the killing in September 2022, it said it \u201cwelcomed\u201d the assessment.That report asserted that Abu Akleh was \u201caccidentally hit\u201d by an Israeli bullet \u201cduring an exchange of fire in which life-risking, widespread and indiscriminate shots were fired toward\u201d Israeli soldiers.To date, the US government has never declassified a State Department report on the killing or confirmed media reports that the Department of Justice was conducting a separate probe.Rights groups, press freedom organisations, and lawmakers have long called the Biden administration\u2019s response inadequate, appealing for greater transparency and for the US to withhold aid to the military unit responsible.Advocates said the latest revelations underscore a continued cycle of impunity.\u201cThe US government has acted as an accomplice to Israeli war crimes, not only against Palestinians but Americans, too, trumping loyalty to its own laws and citizens,\u201d said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the human rights organisation Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), in a statement responding to the documentary."}

There were similar reports about both sides of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022.At the time, DJI suspended all sales to both countries and introduced software modifications that restricted the areas where its drones could be used and how high they could fly.However, DJI has not stopped selling drones to Israel.The Israeli army\u2019s use of DJI drones is not new.By 2018, DJI drones were reportedly in extensive use across numerous divisions in the Israeli military. The Israeli campaign group Hamushim found evidence that Israeli military-trained operators were using DJI\u2019s Matrice 600 model to drop tear gas on civilian protesters during the following year\u2019s Great March of Return in Gaza.Despite their previous deployment by the Israeli military, their lethal use against civilians and protected targets in Gaza, as documented in this investigation, is unprecedented.Al Jazeera has reached out to Israeli authorities to request comment on the findings of this investigation but has received no response by time of publication.Sanad has documented several DJI drones that have been adapted for military use.However, it is the powerful DJI Agras drone, developed for agricultural use, that is the most significant.According to its manufacturers, the DJI Agras can carry a substantial payload and is capable of precision flight.As Sanad\u2019s investigation shows, it can also be used to deliver an explosive payload to targets beyond the reach of conventional military forces.In addition to the DJI Agras, the DJI Mavic has been used by the Israeli military across Gaza for reconnaissance and target acquisition.Similarly, the compact DJI Avata drone, designed for recreational filming, has been repurposed by the Israeli military to navigate and map the intricate tunnel networks beneath Gaza.By late 2024, Israel had laid siege to Gaza\u2019s north, pushing the population to the brink of famine and imposing conditions described as \u201capocalyptic\u201d by United Nations observers.Residents and humanitarian organisations reported an alarming number of what appeared to be civilian drones armed with explosives.In an incident documented by displaced civilians, footage shared on July 17, 2024, shows a DJI Agras drone dropping a bomb onto the IHH Turkish charity\u2019s building in Jabalia, northern Gaza, less than 100 metres (330ft) from a school serving as a shelter and aid distribution centre.In November in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, a DJI Agras drone dropped a bomb in a residential neighbourhood where civilians had fled after Israeli shelling of a UN-operated school-turned-shelter.People who witnessed the bombing told Sanad the attack seemed calculated to instil fear.Beyond direct attacks, Israeli-modified DJI drones have been used extensively for surveillance and tactical operations throughout Gaza.In a further incident, footage obtained by Al Jazeera Arabic from one Israeli drone shows a DJI Avata helping to track an unnamed Palestinian being used by heavily armed Israeli soldiers as a human shield \u2013 an illegal practice under international law \u2013 in Shujaiya in December 2023.The individual is seen opening the school\u2019s doors to make sure there were no Palestinian fighters inside, closely monitored by another drone that captured the entire operation.In 2022, in response to complaints from Ukrainian officials that DJI was sharing critical data with their Russian adversaries, the drone manufacturer suspended all sales to its retail partners in both countries.DJI explained the move: \u201cWe will never accept any use of our products to cause harm, and we will continue striving to improve the world with our work.\u201dDespite evidence of DJI drones being weaponised by the Israeli military in Gaza, DJI has had no such response.Responding to direct inquiries from Sanad, DJI said: \u201cOur products are for peaceful and civilian use only, and we absolutely deplore and condemn the use of [DJI] products to cause harm anywhere in the world.\u201dA subsequent direct query asked if it plans \u201cto halt sales in Israel or implement measures similar to those taken in the Russia-Ukraine conflict\u201d.But DJI did not respond to the query not has it undertaken any measures to halt sales or impose software restrictions on where drones can fly over Gaza, allowing continued military deployments of their drones by the Israeli military."}

However, both sides have accused each other of violating the agreement.Israel still occupies five strategic hilltops along the border. While rockets have been fired into Israel from Lebanese territory on two separate occasions, Hezbollah has denied involvement.The recent escalation marks a sharp intensification of the conflict, rooted in Hezbollah\u2019s support for Hamas during Israel\u2019s ongoing war on Gaza.Hezbollah\u2019s deputy leader, Naim Qassem, has maintained that the group no longer keeps weapons in the border zone, in accordance with the truce."}

There has been heavy fighting in the area, they said.Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reports from Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, that Hamas\u2019s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades says it is engaging in \u201cfierce point-blank clashes and confrontations with Israeli occupation forces operating in the El Geneina neighbourhood east of Rafah city\u201d.\u201cThere are more reports that a number of Israeli forces are trapped under the rubble of a building that had been previously rigged by explosives by Hamas in Rafah city. This has been a tactic that has been used by Hamas fighters to ambush Israeli ground forces\u201d, Azzoum added.Later the Qassam Brigades released this statement: \u201cAs part of the \u2018Gates of Hell\u2019 operations, we detonated a powerful explosive device targeting a patrol of 7 soldiers near the Omar Ibn Al-Khattab Mosque in Al-Tannour neighborhood, east of Rafah. We observed the dismembered bodies of several Israeli soldiers at the scene.\u201dIsraeli Forces were said to be facing difficulties in evacuating the dead and injured from the site due to the intensity of the fighting. Footage broadcast by Israeli sources showed some helicopters ferrying soldiers to hospitals.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City said: \u201cThe available information talks about a group of Israeli soldiers \u2013 this is part of the occupying forces in the city of Rafah \u2013 and they were in the process of placing explosive wires as part of the ongoing, systematic demolition of homes across Rafah City, where the vast majority of buildings were destroyed so far since the invasion of Rafah City.\u201dMahmood also said that \u201ceyewitnesses describe seeing military choppers moving along the borderline. They patrolled the area several times before landing in Rafah City. They also reported massive, heavy machine guns and explosions that kept going on for some time before it got quieter.\u201dIn the meantime, Israeli air strikes have killed at least 16 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, following a deadly 24-hour period in which more than 100 people lost their lives, according to medical officials.New strikes on Thursday killed at least three people in separate attacks in Deir el-Balah and the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, Al Jazeera Arabic reported, quoting medical sources. In Shujayea, east of Gaza City, shelling killed another person and wounded several others.Further north, Israeli warplanes targeted a home in Beit Lahiya, killing nine. Rescuers were still searching for a woman believed to be trapped beneath the rubble.The attack site in Beit Lahiya was \u201cfull of displaced people\u201d, said Mahmoud earlier.\u201cThe owner of this residential home and the displaced people he hosted were killed inside this residential home,\u201d he said. \u201cMany others were reported with severe injuries and burns and transferred to the Indonesian Hospital, which is already overwhelmed.\u201cOne single family just lost nine family members, including women and children, and more people are missing and trapped under the rubble.\u201dIn Khan Younis, one girl was killed and four others wounded after Israeli artillery hit tents sheltering displaced families in the western part of the city.The continuing assault on Gaza comes amid growing alarm that Israel\u2019s total blockade of aid is pushing the enclave into famine.The U.S. State Department said on Thursday a solution to be able to deliver food aid to Gaza was \u201csteps away\u201d, although it did not detail what the plan would entail.European leaders and aid groups have criticized purported Israeli plans to take over distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza and use private companies to get food to families after more than two months in which Israel has prevented supplies entering the besieged territory.Israel\u2019s blockade on Gaza \u2013 tightened on March 2 \u2013 has pushed the population deeper into crisis, cutting off aid and crippling humanitarian relief. On Wednesday, World Central Kitchen (WCK), one of the key food providers in Gaza, announced it had halted all cooking operations.\u201cWe have no more food to prepare,\u201d the aid group said, after exhausting flour and other basic supplies needed to run its soup kitchens and mobile bakeries. WCK had been providing at least 130,000 meals and 80,000 loaves of bread daily.\u201cThe trucks are ready in Egypt, Jordan and Israel,\u201d said WCK founder Jose Andres. \u201cBut they cannot move without permission. Humanitarian aid must be allowed to flow.\u201dThe World Food Programme previously warned that its food stocks in Gaza had run dry, ending a vital lifeline for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. The continuing blockade, aid agencies say, has accelerated the onset of famine. Malnutrition is now widespread, with humanitarian workers warning they can no longer treat or prevent hunger-related illnesses.Rights groups have condemned the blockade as a \u201cstarvation tactic\u201d and argue it may constitute a war crime.Sean Carroll, president of Anera (American Near East Refugee Aid), told Al Jazeera that Gaza\u2019s humanitarian crisis has reached a critical point, with aid deliveries plummeting. \u201cWe were delivering nearly a million meals a week, and we\u2019ve only delivered a few thousand in the past 66 days,\u201d he said, noting that stocks are depleted.\u201cI think governments have to use every diplomatic lever, every political lever, every economic lever to convince all parties that there needs to be a return to some semblance of delivering humanitarian aid. We are losing our humanity here,\u201d said Carroll.Scenes at the few remaining open aid centres are increasingly chaotic. Children, women and men jostle for shrinking rations as food distribution systems break down. Bakeries have shut and fuel shortages have left water distribution networks paralysed.Elsewhere, tensions have flared beyond Gaza, with Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz warning Iran that it could face the same fate as Hamas and Hezbollah. His remarks followed a Houthi drone attack near Israel\u2019s Ben Gurion Airport.\u201cYou are directly responsible,\u201d Katz said on Thursday. \u201cWhat we have done to Hezbollah in Beirut, to Hamas in Gaza, we will do to you in Tehran, too.\u201dYemen\u2019s Houthi rebels launched a ballistic missile that struck near Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv on Sunday, saying the attack was in support of Palestinians in Gaza.The strike disrupted flights and prompted Israel to launch air strikes on Sanaa International Airport and power stations in Houthi-controlled areas, killing at least one and injuring dozens, according to Houthi reports.Iran denied backing the Houthi assault. Despite a United States-Houthi ceasefire mediated by Oman on Tuesday, ensuring \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d in the Red Sea, Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree said, \u201cWe will carry out more military operations against the Israeli enemy,\u201d targeting Israel and its ships."}

During the meeting, the official said President Donald Trump is increasingly frustrated with Israel\u2019s stance on the stalled ceasefire talks.Trump intends to press ahead with the Saudi deal regardless of Israel\u2019s position, said the report on Wednesday.The US president is expected to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates next week. Meanwhile, Israel\u2019s ambassador to Washington is lobbying the White House to add a brief stop in Israel, two Israeli officials told Axios.According to The Jerusalem Post, the US official told attendees Israel could face \u201ca much heavier price\u201d if it continues to oppose a ceasefire deal.\u201cPresident Trump is determined to move forward with a significant deal with Saudi Arabia, even without Israeli involvement,\u201d the official reportedly said. \u201cThe ceasefire agreement with the Houthis is just a prelude. If Israel doesn\u2019t come to its senses, even the \u2018Deal of the Millennium\u2019 will happen without it.\u201dThe report said families of the captives hoped the meeting would result in greater international pressure on Israeli leaders to act. Some attendees said they were alarmed by the unusually blunt tone from the official as Washington has long been viewed as Israel\u2019s closest diplomatic ally.The Trump administration has sought to realign regional alliances, focusing on normalising ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia. \u201cWe hope Israel will board the historic train that has already left the station,\u201d the US official reportedly said. \u201cBut the US will not wait at the platform.\u201dThe official also echoed concerns from the families that ongoing Israeli military operations could endanger the captives.The proposed US-Saudi Arabia-Israel deal aims to normalise ties between Riyadh and Tel Aviv in what would mark a historic diplomatic shift, brokered by Washington.Building on the controversial 2020 Abraham Accords, the agreement would see Saudi Arabia formally recognise Israel \u2013 abandoning its long-held demand for a full Israeli withdrawal from occupied Palestinian territory as outlined in the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative.In return, the US would offer Saudi Arabia a defence pact and access to advanced weapons, while urging Riyadh to scale back its growing ties with China and Russia.Another pillar of the deal includes US support for a Saudi civil nuclear programme, though disagreements over uranium enrichment remain unresolved.While Saudi Arabia originally insisted on concrete steps towards a two-state solution for Palestinians, recent reports suggest Riyadh may settle for symbolic concessions \u2013 such as freezing settlement expansion \u2013 if the US offers enough in return."}

The Trump administration has accused Ozturk of having \u201cengaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans\u201d, though it has not offered evidence.After she was detained outside her home, Ozturk was reportedly whisked across state borders, first to Vermont and later to Louisiana, all within a 24-hour period, according to her lawyers.Critics have described those rapid transfers as a means of subverting due process, separating foreign students from family, friends and legal resources they can otherwise draw upon.In Ozturk\u2019s case, the confusion led her lawyers to file a petition for her release in Massachusetts, as they did not know where she was when they submitted the paperwork.On April 18, a lower court ruled that Ozturk must be returned to Vermont no later than May 1, as it weighed her habeas petition: a type of complaint that challenges the legality of one\u2019s detention.\u201cNo one should be arrested and locked up for their political views. Every day that Rumeysa Ozturk remains in detention is a day too long,\u201d Bhandari, her lawyer, said in a statement.But the Trump administration appealed, seeking an emergency stay of Ozturk\u2019s transfer to Vermont.The Second Circuit Court of Appeals rejected (PDF) that request, however. It said the government had failed to show any \u201cirreparable harm\u201d that Ozturk\u2019s transfer would cause.\u201cFaced with such a conflict between the government\u2019s unspecific financial and administrative concerns on the one hand, and the risk of substantial constitutional harm to Ozturk on the other, we have little difficulty concluding \u2018that the balance of hardships tips decidedly\u2019 in her favor,\u201d the court wrote.Though Ozturk is expected to be transferred to Vermont, where her habeas petition will be heard, the Trump administration is slated to continue with deportation proceedings in Louisiana.The appeals court, however, explained that this should be no challenge for the Trump administration, given that Ozturk can appear through video conference for those hearings.\u201cThe government asserts that it would face difficulties in arranging for Ozturk to appear for her immigration proceedings in Louisiana remotely,\u201d the court wrote. \u201cBut the government has not disputed that it is legally and practically possible for Ozturk to attend removal proceedings remotely.\u201dThe Trump administration has the option of appealing the decision to the Supreme Court.Likewise, Khalil faces deportation proceedings in Louisiana while his habeas petition is heard in New Jersey, closer to his home in New York City.On March 8, he became the first high-profile case of a student protester being arrested for deportation. Agents for Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrived at his student housing building at Columbia University, where his wife, a US citizen, filmed him being handcuffed and led away.Khalil himself was a US permanent resident who recently graduated from Columbia\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs. He is of Palestinian descent.On Tuesday, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in New Jersey rejected a bid by the Trump administration to transfer Khalil\u2019s habeas petition to Louisiana.And on Wednesday, US District Court Judge Michael Farbiarz ordered the Trump administration to provide a specific assessment of the risks Khalil poses by being in the US.Trump\u2019s Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cited Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to justify Khalil\u2019s detention and deportation. A rarely used provision of the law allows secretaries of state to remove noncitizens who could cause \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\u201d.But Rubio has so far been vague about what those consequences might be in Khalil\u2019s case. The student protest leader has been charged with no crime.Judge Farbiarz also required the Trump team to supply a catalogue of every case in which US officials have employed that law. The Trump administration is expected to appeal that judge\u2019s order as well."}

Palestinians will be forced to move \u2013 or starve.Some 5,000 to 6,000 families will be pushed into each camp, according to The Washington Post. Each household will send someone to trek miles to pick up a weekly food parcel from what the Norwegian Refugee Council\u2019s Jan Egeland called \u201cconcentration hubs\u201d.It is unclear how the rest of the population \u2013 possibly some 1.5 million people \u2013 will eat.Israel says it will use facial recognition to identify people picking up food parcels, to deny aid to \u201cHamas\u201d \u2013 yet Israel treats every fighting-age male as a Hamas operative.The private security companies from the United States would also guard within the designated areas.Experts and UN agencies are decrying the plan as impractical and inhumane.Israel\u2019s genocidal war on Gaza continues, and Palestinians will continue to suffer.Since Israel began its war on Gaza on October 7, 2023, it has cloaked its mass expulsions in what it claims are humane \u201cadvance warnings\u201d in which families have mere hours to pack their belongings and flee to a zone Israel determines. Israel often bombs those safe zones anyway.\u201cIf you are viewing this plan through aid distribution, it makes no sense,\u201d Diana Buttu, legal scholar and former adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization, told Al Jazeera.\u201cIf you view it through a political project, which is ethnic cleansing and cantonisation by using food as a weapon of war, then this plan does make sense,\u201d she said, adding that the \u201cplan\u201d is consistent with Israel\u2019s aim of carrying out a genocide in Gaza.That they are afraid, and starving, after two months of Israel blocking all aid and regular shipments of food.\u201cIf there is a plan to expand the war and reoccupy Gaza and repeat the displacement, why were we allowed to return to the north again?\u201d Noor Ayash, 31, asks.\u201cWhat more does Netanyahu want? We\u2019re dying in every way.\u201dMahmoud al-Nabahin, 77, who has been displaced for the past 18 months, says Netanyahu\u2019s threats are meaningless.He has lost everything; Israel killed his wife and daughter in a raid months ago, and their home and farm are gone.\u201c[This] means nothing but our annihilation. We\u2019ve lost all hope. Let him do whatever he wants,\u201d he says from his tent in Deir el-Balah.\u201cWe don\u2019t have weapons. We\u2019re civilians left in the wind. People will refuse displacement, but will be forced by the army.\u201dThey want to finish their genocide under the guise of facilitating food aid and rescuing Israeli captives, Omar Rahman, an expert on Israel-Palestine for the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said.\u201cIsrael has been telegraphing its real intentions from the start of this campaign: Destroy Gaza and eliminate its population both by starvation and mass killing,\u201d he said.Israel\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d signals its intent to starve Palestinians who resist being expelled from north Gaza, said Heidi Matthews, a legal scholar at York University, Canada.\u201cIt is inconceivable that the population can be adequately provided for \u2026 whilst being crowded into southern Gaza,\u201d she said.\u201cThis indicates the genocidal intent to inflict on the Palestinian population of Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201dNot clear.Israel plans to hire two US private security firms, Safe Reach Solutions and UG Solutions, to provide security and possibly help with food distribution.The first is headed by Phil Riley, a former CIA intelligence officer. The second is run by Jameson Govoni, a former member of the US Army Special Forces.These companies could give Israel plausible deniability if abuses or atrocities occur, said Mairav Zonszein, an expert on Israel-Palestine for the International Crisis Group.She added that Israel will also call up thousands of reservists to maintain a physical occupation over northern Gaza, despite many soldiers being fatigued by war and financial troubles.\u201cThere is definitely a lower \u2026 turnout among reservists than at the start of the war. But that doesn\u2019t mean there is actually a manpower shortage,\u201d Zonszein told Al Jazeera.In addition, she noted, despite Israeli society opposing expanding the war on Gaza without first retrieving the captives, Netanyahu is more concerned with appeasing far-right ministers in his coalition by fighting on.Netanyahu risks losing power and standing trial for corruption charges if the coalition collapses.Not UN agencies.A UN spokesman said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was \u201calarmed\u201d by Israel\u2019s plan and that it will \u201cinevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza\u201d.\u201cGaza is, and must remain, an integral part of a future Palestinian state,\u201d said spokesman Farhan Haq.The UN also issued a statement saying Israel\u2019s plan for Gaza would \u201ccontravene fundamental humanitarian principles\u201d and deepen suffering for civilians.But the UN may conclude that it must participate in Israel\u2019s scheme out of fear that even more Palestinians in Gaza will starve if it doesn\u2019t, said Buttu, putting the onus on Western states, who primarily fund UN agencies, to support the UN\u2019s position by sanctioning Israel."}

He said the ongoing licences covered items such as \u201cgoggles and helmets for use by one of the UK\u2019s closest allies\u201d.The report used data from the Israel Tax Authority and concluded that Lammy had \u201cmisled\u201d Parliament and the public about arms exports to Israel.Former Labour shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said the government has a lot of \u201cexplaining to do\u201d in response to the report.\u201cIf Parliament has been misled by the Foreign Secretary or any minister it is a resigning matter and more importantly it attracts potentially a charge of complicity in war crimes. The Government has shrouded its arms supplies to Israel in secrecy,\u201d McDonnell said.Former leader of the Labour Party and independent MP, Jeremy Corbyn, said the report could explain why the government has not responded to a call for a public inquiry into the UK\u2019s role in Israel\u2019s military assault.\u201cWhen will the UK government come clean about the reality of military cooperation with Israel? The public deserves to know the full scale of the UK\u2019s complicity in crimes against humanity \u2013 and we are not going anywhere until we have established the truth,\u201d he said.The Foreign Office told Al Jazeera that the government has suspended the \u201crelevant licences\u201d that might be used to \u201ccommit or facilitate serious violations of International Humanitarian Law in Gaza.\u201d\u201cOf the remaining licences for Israel, the vast majority are not for the Israeli Defence Forces but are for civilian purposes or re-export, and therefore are not used in the war in Gaza. The only exemption is the F-35 programme due to its strategic role in NATO and wider implications for international peace and security,\u201d the ministry said.\u201cAny suggestion that the UK is licensing other weapons for use by Israel in the war in Gaza is misleading.\u201d\u201cThe UK totally opposes an expansion of Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza.

Two missiles were fired at two locations at the same time, 100 metres (110 yards) apart, one inside a restaurant and another at an intersection, killing at least 17 people.Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera\u2019s Hani Mahmoud said the attack hit one of the few places where Palestinians are able to get a meal.\u201cThe tables and chairs are all thrown around, and blood stains the ground as a result of severe bleeding,\u201d Mahmoud said, reporting from a crowd of residents and street vendors examining the destruction after the attack.At the site of the attack on the nearby intersection, Mahmoud said people were on the ground \u201csoaked in blood and shredded into pieces\u201d.Another attack in Gaza City killed 13 people at al-Karama School in the Tuffah neighbourhood Other Israeli strikes on Wednesday were scattered across Gaza. Three people were killed and several wounded in a strike on a house in Jabalia in northern Gaza.Another eight people \u2013 including a father, his children and cousins \u2013 were killed in the southern city of Khan Younis. Five were killed in a strike on one home.Another three people, including a child, died when a tent shelter was attacked in Deir el-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. A husband and wife were also killed when a house was hit in Bani Suheila village in eastern Gaza.The dead also included four people whose bodies were recovered from under the rubble of an Israeli attack earlier this week on a school sheltering displaced people in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. The Palestinian Civil Defence agency said on Tuesday night that more than 30 people had been killed and dozens wounded there.Mahmoud said Palestinians were \u201cscrambling for cover\u201d as air strikes and explosions struck residential buildings and evacuation centres across Gaza.\u201cWe have confirmed that a farmer was killed in the eastern part of Khan Younis, in Abasan, as he was trying to harvest what he managed to plant in the past couple of months, making up for the lack of food,\u201d Mahmoud said.\u201cThis is one of the elements that we have been seeing quite visibly. Not only are they suffering on a daily basis because of the enforced starvation and dehydration, they [also] try to plant their own food, but they are deprived, and their abilities to do so are [thwarted] by the ongoing attacks,\u201d he added.The intensified attacks have been compounded by an Israeli blockade on essential supplies since March 2, leaving the enclave deprived of fuel and food, including flour. Aid groups have said food supplies are close to total depletion.The United States-based World Central Kitchen charity said it has halted work in the Gaza Strip after it was prevented by Israel from bringing in aid and ran out of supplies.\u201cAfter serving more than 130 million total meals and 26 million loaves of bread over the past 18 months, World Central Kitchen no longer has the supplies to cook meals or bake bread in Gaza,\u201d it said on Wednesday in a post on X.A mother of six sheltering at a facility run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) told the agency her family only had bread after they had run out of all other types of food.\u201cThe State of Israel must lift the siege,\u201d UNRWA wrote on X on Wednesday.\u201cThere must be a concerted international effort to stop this humanitarian catastrophe from reaching a new unseen level,\u201d it added.Gaza\u2019s health sector is also bearing the brunt of the ongoing attacks and blockade. At least 88 percent of beds in hospitals are occupied, and their staffs are trying to treat patients as they face shortages of medical supplies.On Wednesday, Egypt and Qatar, which both mediated this year\u2019s ceasefire alongside the US, reaffirmed their commitment to an agreement aimed at ending the \u201cunprecedented humanitarian crisis and alleviating the suffering of civilians by fostering the necessary conditions for achieving a comprehensive ceasefire\u201d.\u201cThe two countries emphasise that attempts to sow discord among brotherly nations \u2013 whether through the casting of doubt, distortion, or media escalation \u2013 will not succeed, nor will they deter the two nations from continuing their joint efforts to end the war and the resulting humanitarian catastrophe,\u201d a joint statement read, adding that the countries were working with the US to reach a deal.While Israel announced that a more intense military offensive would begin in Gaza unless a ceasefire was signed, Hamas said the talks were pointless.\u201cThere is no sense in engaging in talks or considering new ceasefire proposals as long as the hunger war and extermination war continue in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Hamas official Basem Naim told the AFP news agency on Tuesday."}

Shortly after the tents started popping up, the campus also witnessed some of the first mass arrests of student protesters in the Palestinian solidarity movement.That visibility has made Columbia a focal point for President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to crack down on what he called \u201cillegal protests\u201d and campus anti-Semitism.Earlier this year, Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil became the first student activist to be detained by the Trump administration and targeted for deportation.Tuesday\u2019s delegation of Jewish students came to Congress to push the case that Khalil and others like him should never have been detained in their name. They met with at least 17 Democratic legislators from both the House of Representatives and the Senate.Al Jazeera spoke to several students who participated in the lobbying day, which was organised by Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) Action, an advocacy organisation. Here are some of their stories:Raised in upstate New York, history major Tali Beckwith-Cohen said she grew up in a community where Zionism was the norm. She remembers being told \u201cmyths\u201d about Palestine as \u201ca land without a people for a people without a land\u201d: a slogan used to justify the establishment of Israel.But as she began to learn Palestinian history and meet Palestinians, Beckwith-Cohen said her beliefs were challenged.Eventually, after the war in Gaza began in October 2023, she became involved in Palestinian rights activism.Human rights groups and United Nations experts have found evidence that Israel\u2019s tactics in Gaza are \u201cconsistent with genocide\u201d. More than 52,615 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict so far.\u201cFor a long time, I had this kind of feeling of discomfort, this feeling of wrestling, this feeling of maybe cognitive dissonance, and how can I reckon these values I hold dear with Zionism?\u201d Beckwith-Cohen told Al Jazeera.\u201cWe are seeing the bombing, the disregard for human life, for children, for hospitals, for schools. It forced me to make a choice.\u201dShe stressed that the protests were spaces of solidarity, where students of all backgrounds were committed to the idea that their safety is intertwined.\u201cThere\u2019s so much in the media narrative about what\u2019s happening on Columbia campus that is just disingenuous and just so untrue to what we\u2019ve experienced,\u201d  Beckwith-Cohen said.\u201cSo we\u2019re here today to tell our Congress people that what we\u2019re seeing on campus is clearly an authoritarian, fascist crackdown on all dissent, not only students peacefully advocating for an end to genocide.\u201dWhen Carly Shaffer voiced concern about the Israeli escalation in Gaza on a university WhatsApp chat, some of her fellow students questioned her Judaism.Out of the hundreds of people on the chat, she remembers that Khalil \u2013 the activist arrested for deportation \u2013 was the only person who contacted her directly to reject the comments she was subjected to.As she got to know Khalil, she came to view him as the \u201cembodiment\u201d of someone who cared about the safety of all students on campus.Shaffer told Al Jazeera that she felt \u201csick\u201d and \u201chorrified\u201d when Khalil was arrested. Her discomfort was then compounded when she saw that the Trump White House celebrated his detention on social media with the phrase \u201cShalom, Mahmoud\u201d \u2013 a Jewish greeting repurposed as a taunt.Shaffer, who is pursuing a master\u2019s degree in human rights and social policy, grew up in California and was raised by a single mother in a low-income household.She said speaking out against injustice \u2013 including in Palestine \u2013 is a practice rooted in her Jewish faith.\u201cThe Columbia protest movement, it\u2019s a movement of love. It\u2019s a movement of solidarity,\u201d Shaffer said. \u201cAnd Jewish students are also integral and crucial to this movement.\u201dShe said that, when Jewish student protesters held religious events on campus, their peers from the encampment joined them and inquired about their traditions.\u201cThese are the same students who are being portrayed as anti-Semites, who are going out of their way to go and learn about Passover and celebrate a Jewish holiday with their Jewish friends,\u201d Shaffer told Al Jazeera.She decried the \u201cweaponisation of anti-Semitism\u201d, saying that the issue is being used to shut down conversations about Israeli atrocities in Gaza.\u201cJewish students are being used as pawns in Trump\u2019s political agenda,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the weaponisation of anti-Semitism to dismantle this movement is not just a threat to Jewish students; it\u2019s a threat to all of us. That\u2019s why it is so important for us as Jewish students to directly correct this false narrative.\u201dBarnard College student Sarah Borus, who was arrested during the crackdown on the Columbia encampment, said she grew up in an anti-Zionist family in a \u201cvery Zionist community\u201d.She felt it was important for Jewish students like herself to convey their experiences directly to the people in power in Washington, DC.\u201cWe\u2019re talking to members of Congress to tell them our stories that are left out of mainstream news,\u201d Borus told Al Jazeera.\u201cTrump\u2019s mission is not about protecting Jewish students. It is about using fears of anti-Semitism \u2013 because of the way that the Gaza solidarity encampment was portrayed last year \u2013 in order to target non-citizen student activists, in order to target academic freedom, free speech, and really put many, many people in danger.\u201dWhen asked how she feels about the potential backlash to her activism, Borus acknowledged that the current political climate left her fearful.\u201cI\u2019m scared, but in the grand scheme of things, I\u2019m proud of the choices I have made,\u201d she said. \u201cI would not make any different ones, and I am willing to take on the risks, if that\u2019s what must be done.\u201dShay Orentlicher has no regrets about participating in Columbia University\u2019s encampments, despite the administrative and political crackdowns.Orentlicher said Christian nationalists are trying to erase the perspective of pro-Palestine Jewish students and define Judaism in a way that fits their political purposes.But protesting against the killing of Palestinians, Orentlicher said, is an expression of both Jewish and humanist values. And Orentlicher believes that Columbia\u2019s demonstrations have helped raise awareness nationwide.\u201cDespite the oppression we have faced, despite the suffering, and despite the despair of worrying that we have not done enough to stop the genocide, to stand up for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, I think we have shifted the public discourse in a really important way,\u201d Orentlicher said.\u201cAnd we also have built a really beautiful community. And I don\u2019t regret what I did at all. I wouldn\u2019t change anything.\u201dRaphie, who chose to identify by his first name only, said he grew up \u201cvery Zionist\u201d. But as he learned more about the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, he felt he had been deceived.\u201cThe Jewish elementary school I went to, for instance, had a map of Israel, and it was like a diamond \u2013 no West Bank or Gaza on it,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen I saw the actual map with the occupied territories, I was like, \u2018Wait, I was lied to.\u2019 And that kind of made me go on this whole journey of exploring what Zionism is, what occupation is, what settler colonialism is.\u201dRaphie, who is studying maths, said the war on Gaza, the campus protests and the backlash the student protesters faced all made him feel a \u201cpersonal responsibility to fight for what is right\u201d.In his experience, the demonstrations were welcoming, not anti-Semitic. What was anti-Semitic, he said, was the fact that the university targeted Jewish student protesters for their political views.Several students, including Raphie, said Columbia refused to grant students associated with Jewish Voice for Peace the permission necessary to hold religious celebrations in public spaces. They described that rejection as a form of discrimination.The university did not respond to Al Jazeera\u2019s request for comment by the time of publication.Raphie also drew a distinction between feeling uncomfortable about ideas that challenge one\u2019s worldview and actually being unsafe.\u201cIt\u2019s normal in college to encounter new viewpoints, new perspectives. That\u2019s how I became more pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist,\u201d he said. \u201cI initially felt uncomfortable when I encountered anti-Zionist views, but then I grew to understand them. That\u2019s normal.\u201dRaphie stressed that the real suffering is happening in Gaza.\u201cThe students who are not safe right now, of course, are the students in Gaza. Every university in Gaza has been destroyed. They haven\u2019t had food for 60 days.\u201d"}

They just don\u2019t want to fight, and we will honour that, and we will stop the bombings,\u201d Trump told reporters in the White House on Tuesday during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.Trump claimed that the Iran-aligned Yemeni group \u201ccapitulated\u201d and has promised not to carry out attacks on shipping. It launched those attacks in October 2023 shortly after the war in Gaza started, saying the attacks were in support of Palestinians.\u201cI will accept their word, and we will be stopping the bombing of Houthis, effective immediately,\u201d the US president said.Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said the two sides have agreed to a ceasefire.\u201cFollowing recent discussions and contacts conducted by the Sultanate of Oman with the United States and the relevant authorities in Sana\u2019a, in the Republic of Yemen, with the aim of de-escalation, efforts have resulted in a ceasefire agreement between the two sides,\u201d he wrote in a post on X.\u201cIn the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping.\u201dMohammed Ali al-Houthi, a member of the Houthis\u2019 Supreme Political Council, wrote in a post on X that \u201cTrump\u2019s announcement of a halt to America\u2019s aggression against Yemen will be evaluated on the ground first.\u201d\u201cYemen operations were and still are a support for Gaza to stop the aggression and bring in aid,\u201d he added, suggesting that the group would not halt its attacks on Israel.Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera\u2019s Mike Hanna said that the US State Department clarified that the agreement did not relate to the conflict between Israel and the Houthis.\u201cIt was made very clear by the US State Department that the deal relates directly to Houthi operations in the coast of Yemen, specifically in regard to US shipping,\u201d he said.The ceasefire announcement comes hours after the Israeli military launched air strikes on the airport in Sanaa, inflicting devastating damage and rendering it inoperable.Dozens of Israeli warplanes also launched several waves of large-scale overnight strikes on Yemen\u2019s vital port of Hodeidah in what Israel said was a response after the Houthis hit the perimeter of Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion International Airport with a ballistic missile.The US military has been launching daily air strikes across Yemen for nearly two months, destroying infrastructure and killing dozens of people, including children and civilians.Al Jazeera\u2019s Ali Hashem said it was \u201cpossible\u201d that Iran helped to convince the Houthis to de-escalate their attacks.\u201cThe Omanis have also been the main mediators between the US and Iran, and now the Houthis and the Americans. There are indications that the nuclear talks are advancing, with a framework shaping over sanctions lifting in exchange for nuclear restrictions,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is possible that the Iranians have helped in convincing the Houthis to de-escalate, especially if we see this reflected on the Iranian-American talks.

In the north, nearly all of Gaza City is under similar orders, with only small pockets in the northwest still exempt. Entire areas east of the Shujayea neighbourhood and along the Israeli border have been declared a restricted zone.The animated map below shows how Israel\u2019s military has expanded its forced displacement orders since breaking the ceasefire on March 18.On Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Gaza\u2019s more than two million people \u201cwill be moved\u201d in a new ground offensive that will involve Israeli troops holding on to seized territory, establishing a \u201csustained presence\u201d in Gaza.This follows the unanimous approval by Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet to call up 60,000 reservists and place the Israeli military in control of delivering food and other essential supplies to Gaza\u2019s starving population.Reporting from Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, Al Jazeera correspondent Tareq Abu Azzoum said Palestinians view the Israeli ground offensive in Gaza and reoccupation of much of its territorial landscape as a form of collective punishment and an attempt to change the demographic and political map of Gaza.Many Palestinians understand that Israel is prioritising territorial control over any political solution, and many shared their fear and panic regarding the possibility of not being able to return to their homes.They also believe that Israel is trying not just to dismantle the military capabilities of Hamas, as the Israeli military spokesperson and Netanyahu have stated, but they are also trying to empty Gaza of its residents and to suffocate civilians.Israel will do this by using humanitarian language alongside military tactics, including an expanded ground offensive and tightening its grip on the flow of aid to Gaza.But there was a general and clear sentiment of defiance among many Palestinians. Social media is filled with messages of resilience and people saying they will not leave Gaza, whatever the cost.The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) says Gaza is facing \u201cextreme risk of famine\u201d with no food remaining in markets and aid distribution centres.Israeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem has accused Israel of \u201cusing starvation as a method of warfare\u201d in Gaza. Half of those being starved by Israel are children, the prominent rights group said.\u201c[On] the nutritional front, the population is facing once again an extreme risk of famine,\u201d the PRCS said in its latest situation update.\u201cThere is an inability to meet even the minimum daily needs of over a million displaced people,\u201d it said.The PRCS\u2019s food stocks allocated for displaced people are now \u201ccompletely depleted\u201d, with \u201climited quantities of legumes\u201d being \u201cdistributed to community kitchens to cover some of the basic needs of displaced individuals\u201d.Since Israel broke the nearly two-month-long ceasefire with Hamas on March 18, its military has killed at least 2,459 Palestinians in Gaza, bringing the total number of confirmed killed in the besieged Strip to 52,567."}

Because of severe malnutrition, she suffered from blood acidity, liver and kidney failure, and many other complications. Her hair and nails also fell out due to malnutrition.\u201dAccording to leaked plans, Israel\u2019s government reportedly wants to severely restrict the way food is distributed in Gaza and is proposing that United States companies take over distribution from the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies.Under the plan, Palestinian families would be allowed to take one food parcel a week in designated hubs in southern Gaza, and Israel would permit 60 trucks to enter the Gaza Strip every day \u2013 just one-tenth of what\u2019s needed, according to experts.Aid groups in the UN have rejected this plan, saying it\u2019s a pressure tactic to further reinforce control over life-saving supplies."}

They were exercising their right to protest and engage in political speech on public property.\u201dDespite dropping the charges and growing criticism of the case, Nessel on Monday defended her decision to pursue felony charges against the students, saying \u201ca reasonable jury would find the defendants guilty of the crimes alleged\u201d.However, Nessel added in a statement that she dropped the charges nearly a year later because she did not believe \u201cthese cases to be a prudent use of my department\u2019s resources\u201d.While hundreds of students were arrested during the wave of pro-Palestine campus encampments that swept the United States last year amid Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, most were immediately released.The case in Michigan gained national attention and became symbolic of the nationwide crackdown on pro-Palestine demonstrations, with Palestinian rights advocates arguing that the Nessel case was an attack on freedom of speech and assembly.Defence lawyers for the accused had filed motions for Nessel to recuse herself from the case, citing accusations of bias \u2013 assertions that the attorney general dismissed as \u201cbaseless and absurd\u201d.\u201cThese distractions and ongoing delays have created a circus-like atmosphere to these proceedings,\u201d the attorney general said in her statement.Khuja, the defence lawyer, said the team was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d of winning the case, either by judicial dismissal or not-guilty jury verdict, and criticised Nessel\u2019s characterisation of the pretrial proceedings as \u201ccircus-like\u201d as untrue.He said requesting Nessel\u2019s removal from the case was warranted, adding that the charges should have been brought by the county and not the state\u2019s attorney general, according to Michigan\u2019s prosecution procedures.To underscore the alleged bias, the defence lawyer also noted that weeks before filing the charges last year, Nessel had clashed with Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, \u201cthe only Palestinian in Congress\u201d, for defending the chant \u201cfrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\u201d, which has been used by student protesters.Soon after Nessel charged the students, Tlaib accused the attorney general of \u201cpossible biases\u201d within her agency, underscoring that other protest movements did not face a similar legal crackdown.The attorney general responded by accusing Tlaib of anti-Semitism, although the congresswoman made no mention of the attorney general\u2019s religion or Jewish identity.\u201cRashida should not use my religion to imply I cannot perform my job fairly as Attorney General. It\u2019s anti-Semitic and wrong,\u201d Nessel wrote in a social media post in September.The controversy stretched for weeks, with CNN and pro-Israel outlets echoing Nessel\u2019s anti-Semitism allegations against Tlaib without evidence.Khuja said the attorney general ultimately wanted to \u201cmake an example out of those protesting for Palestine\u201d.He added that the case was larger than the students and politicians involved.\u201cThe First Amendment applies to all speech, but it\u2019s been under attack in order to shield Israel from criticism lately,\u201d Khuja told Al Jazeera.\u201cAnd this case proved that those who believe in Palestinian rights, their views are just as legitimate as anybody else\u2019s, and the First Amendment protects those views and your right to express them.\u201d"}

Axios quoted a senior US official who said the air raids were coordinated between Israel and the US.A US defence source told Al Jazeera that \u201cUS forces did not participate in the Israeli strikes on Yemen today\u201d but did not deny nonlethal support may have been provided.The attack was carried out after a ballistic missile fired from Yemen on Sunday struck close to Ben Gurion International Airport outside Tel Aviv.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had pledged retaliation for the Houthi attack, the first known missile to avoid interception since the Yemeni group began targeting Israel in November 2023.Al Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem reported that about 30 Israeli warplanes took part in Monday\u2019s operation, which was overseen by Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz from a command centre in Tel Aviv.Hashem said the strikes mark a \u201cnew phase\u201d in Israeli attacks on Yemen.Since President Donald Trump returned to power in January, the US has embarked on a more aggressive assault on Yemen \u201cwhich is related directly to Israeli interests\u201d, Hashem added.This is not the first time Israel has bombed targets in Yemen. In December, air raids struck the Ras Isa oil terminal and other sites in Hodeidah province, killing at least nine people.While most Houthi-launched projectiles have been intercepted, Sunday\u2019s attack was the \u201cmost significant strike\u201d, Hashem said, since the group launched its campaign in November 2023, which it said is in response to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and to show solidarity with Palestinians. A drone had previously hit a building in Tel Aviv last year.Since November 2023, the Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, have launched more than 100 drone and missile attacks targeting vessels they said are linked to Israel in the Red Sea.Although the Houthis paused attacks during a frail ceasefire in Gaza this year, they resumed their operations after Israel cut off humanitarian aid to Gaza and resumed its offensive in March."}

You are allowed to disagree and protest,\u201d Kirk wrote on X on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ve allowed far too many people who hate America move here from abroad, but the right to speak freely is the birthright of all Americans.\u201dSteve Bannon, a former Trump adviser and influential right-wing media personality, backed the comments of Kirk and Greene, writing on the social media platform Gettr, \u201cFact check: True\u201d and \u201cAgreed\u201d in response to their statements, respectively.The proposed legislation was introduced by pro-Israel hawks in the US Congress, Republican Mike Lawler and Democrat Josh Gottheimer, in January, and has been co-sponsored by 22 other lawmakers from both major parties.The bill would expand a 2018 law that bans coercive boycotts imposed by foreign governments to include international governmental organisations (IGOs).The original legislation prohibits boycotting a country friendly to the US based on an \u201cagreement with, a requirement of, or a request from or on behalf\u201d of another nation. It imposes penalties of up to $1m and 20 years in prison for violations.Expanding the legislation to include IGOs risks penalising individuals and companies in the US that boycott firms listed by the United Nations as doing business in illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.While the bill itself does not explicitly mention Israel, its drafters have said that it targets the UN and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement, which calls for economic pressure on the Israeli government to end its abuses against Palestinians.\u201cThis change targets harmful and inherently anti-Semitic BDS efforts at IGOs, such as the UN, by extending protections already in place for boycotts instigated by foreign countries,\u201d Lawler\u2019s office said in January.States and the federal government have been passing anti-BDS laws for years, raising the alarm about the violation of free speech rights, which are guaranteed by the First Amendment of the US Constitution.Numerous legal cases have challenged these laws, and some judges have ruled that they are unconstitutional, while others have upheld them.Rights groups and Palestinian rights advocates have argued that anti-boycott laws aim to shut down the debate about Israel and criminalise peaceful resistance against its violations of international law.Over the years, leading UN agencies and rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have accused Israel of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including imposing apartheid on Palestinians.But supporters of anti-BDS laws say the measures are designed to combat discrimination against Israel and regulate trade, not speech.Such laws have mainly faced opposition from progressive Democrats, but the IGO Anti-Boycott Act has generated anger from right-wing politicians, too.\u201cAmericans have the right to boycott, and penalizing this risks free speech. I reject and vehemently condemn antisemitism but I cannot violate the first amendment,\u201d Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, wrote on X.I agree with @RepMTG .\nI\u2019ll be voting No on this bill as well. https://t.co/YOPga59Xyc\u2014 Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) May 4, 2025The right-wing rejection of the Lawler-Gottheimer bill comes as the Trump administration continues with its push to target criticism of and protests against Israel, especially on college campuses.Since Trump took office, the US government has revoked the visas of hundreds of students for activism against Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.Several students, including legal permanent residents, have been jailed over allegations of anti-Semitism and \u201cspreading Hamas propaganda\u201d.Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University, has been detained since March, and the only known allegation against her is co-authoring an op-ed calling on her college to honour the student senate\u2019s call for divesting from Israeli companies.Trump has also frozen and threatened to freeze federal funding for several universities, including Harvard, over pro-Palestine protests."}

Senior Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi told Al Jazeera the group would only accept a deal with Israel that includes a comprehensive ceasefire and the complete withdrawal from Gaza.\u201cOur people have no choice but to achieve a comprehensive deal that guarantees security and safety for our people,\u201d he said, adding that any Israeli efforts to achieve concessions through threats or mass killings would fail.A United Nations spokesman said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was \u201calarmed\u201d by the Israeli plan that \u201cwill inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza\u201d.\u201cGaza is, and must remain, an integral part of a future Palestinian state,\u201d said spokesman Farhan Haq.The plans have stirred significant tension inside Israel as well.While Netanyahu again asserted that the goal was to \u201cdefeat\u201d Hamas and bring back several dozen captives held in Gaza, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an Israeli campaign group, said in a statement on Monday that the plan is \u201csacrificing\u201d those still held in the Palestinian territory.Heated disagreements also reportedly erupted during the cabinet meeting between the political and military figures.Army chief Eyal Zamir reportedly warned that Israel could \u201close\u201d the captives in Gaza if it pushed ahead with a full-blown military offensive.Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said that, as Israel has done in the past two months, it should continue to block all food, water, medicine, fuel and other aid from entering Gaza to starve the population.He also advocated for \u201cbombing food warehouses and generators\u201d so there are no more supplies and electricity is fully cut off.But Zamir warned this would \u201cendanger\u201d Israel as it would expose the country to even more allegations of violations of international law.\u201cYou don\u2019t understand what you are saying. You are endangering us all. There is an international law, we are committed to it. We cannot starve the Strip, your statements are dangerous,\u201d Zamir said, according to Israel\u2019s national broadcaster, Kan.In an interview with Israeli Army Radio, opposition leader Yair Lapid questioned Netanyahu\u2019s decision to mobilise tens of thousands of reservists, saying the prime minister was calling up troops and extending their service without setting a goal for the operation.Another opposition figure, Yair Golan, said Netanyahu was only trying to save his government from collapsing as the plan \u201cserves no security purpose and does not bring the release of the hostages closer\u201d.Ben-Gvir was reportedly the only member of the Security Cabinet who opposed the plan for Israel to bypass existing aid routes by international organisations.Israel, which has blocked the entrance of all supplies into Gaza since March 2, reportedly plans to use US security contractors to control the flow of aid into Gaza.However, the plan is not expected to come into effect immediately, as Israeli officials believe there is enough food in Gaza for now, even as Palestinians are starving to death.The Israeli plans also envisage the establishment of a new \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d in southern Gaza that would work as a base for aid.The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), a forum that includes United Nations agencies, said on Sunday that Israeli officials were seeking its consent to deliver aid through what it described as \u201cIsraeli hubs under conditions set by the Israeli military, once the government agrees to re-open crossings\u201d.In a statement, the HCT said such a plan would be dangerous and would \u201ccontravene fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic \u2013 as part of a military strategy\u201d.The coalition said the UN would not participate in this scheme as it does not adhere to the global humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality.Jan Egeland, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, told Al Jazeera the Israeli government wanted to \u201cmilitarise, manipulate, politicise the aid by allowing only aid to a few concentration hubs in the south, a scheme where people will be screened where it\u2019s a completely inoperable system\u201d.\u201cThat would force people to move to get aid, and it would continue the starvation of the civilian population,\u201d he added.On Monday, Hamas branded Israel\u2019s plans to take over aid provision \u201cpolitical blackmail\u201d.\u201cWe reject the use of aid as a tool of political blackmail and support the UN\u2019s stance against any arrangements that violate humanitarian principles,\u201d the armed group said in a statement, insisting that Israel is \u201cfully responsible\u201d for the \u201chumanitarian catastrophe\u201d in Gaza."}

Malta denied the claim, saying the crew had refused assistance and even refused to allow a surveyor on board to assess the damage.\u201cThe FFC would like to clarify our commitment to engagement with [Maltese] authorities to expedite the temporary docking of our ship for repairs and surveyors, so we can continue on the urgent humanitarian mission to Gaza,\u201d the coalition said in a statement later in the day.A Malta government spokesman said its offer was to assist in repairs out at sea once the boat\u2019s cargo was verified to be aid.Coalition officials said the surveyor was welcome to board as part of a deal being negotiated with Malta.Israel halted humanitarian aid to Gaza two months ago, shortly before it broke a ceasefire and restarted its war against Hamas, which has devastated the Palestinian enclave and killed more than 51,000 people.Another NGO ship on a similar mission to Gaza in 2010 was stopped and boarded by Israeli troops, and nine activists were killed. Other such ships have similarly been stopped and boarded, with activists arrested.Hamas issued a statement about the incident off Malta, accusing Israel of \u201cpiracy\u201d and \u201cstate terrorism\u201d."}

We are increasing the pressure to return our people [held captive in Gaza] and defeat Hamas,\u201d Zamir said, adding that the Israeli military would \u201coperate in additional areas and destroy all of [Hamas\u2019s] infrastructure above and below ground\u201d.The military chief made the announcement during a visit to the Atlit naval base on Israel\u2019s northern Mediterranean coast.The announcement came before a Netanyahu-chaired security cabinet meeting to discuss an expansion of the war in Gaza, which began in October 2023 and has decimated the Palestinian enclave.A growing movement within Israel has called for an end to the war, and an increasing number of reservists are ignoring call-ups.Two government officials told the Reuters news agency that the cabinet would also discuss the possible resumption of aid to Gaza as humanitarian groups warn of increased starvation in the territory since Israel imposed a total blockade on March 2.Israel continues to face widespread global outrage over the conduct of its war in Gaza, which has shattered the territory\u2019s infrastructure as well as its healthcare system and displaced the vast majority of its 2.3 million residents at least once since the war began.Far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, in an interview with Israeli Army Radio, said he wanted to see a \u201cpowerful\u201d expansion of the war but did not disclose details as to what new plans might entail.\u201cWe need to increase the intensity and continue until we achieve total victory. We must win a total victory,\u201d he said. He demanded that Israel bomb \u201cthe food and electricity supplies\u201d in Gaza.Leading humanitarian groups, including the Red Cross, have warned that the humanitarian response in Gaza is on the verge of \u201ctotal collapse\u201d and Palestinians face a \u201cdaily struggle to survive\u201d amid bombardment and the crippling blockade.United Nations agencies have said truck convoys carrying aid are building up at the border and have not been allowed into the enclave, where a famine is looming.Israeli officials claim an expanded military offensive would pressure Hamas into releasing the 59 remaining captives, but critics argue it further endangers their lives. Israel ending the fragile ceasefire, which saw Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Israeli captives, on March 18 has not led to any more releases.The reserve call-ups are going out as Netanyahu promised to respond to Yemen\u2019s Houthis after the rebels fired a missile that struck a road at Israel\u2019s Ben Gurion International Airport, wounding six people and prompting several major airlines to suspend flights.Netanyahu said the response will take place \u201cat a time and place of our choosing\u201d.The Houthis have said their fighters carried out the assault \u201cin support of the oppressed Palestinian people\u201d and to counter Israel\u2019s \u201ccrime of genocide\u201d in Gaza."}

A lack of Israeli police action has further emboldened settlers, who cite the Torah in claiming rights over Palestinian lands.Issa Amro, who was featured in The Settlers documentary made by British-American journalist and broadcaster Louis Theroux, released footage online showing how armed soldiers and settlers raided his house in Hebron in the occupied West Bank.Amro said police also threatened him with arrest and told him not to file a complaint in what he said is another instance of apartheid imposed by Israel in the West Bank. Rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have accused Israel of practising apartheid in occupied territory.Amro added on Sunday that the Israeli settlers who attacked him a day earlier told him United States President Donald Trump backed them. The settlers felt \u201cemboldened because of the Trump administration\u2019s blind support\u201d, the activist said.Theroux said he and his team have remained in regular contact with Amro.. @Issaamro who featured in The Settlers has posted videos of his latest harassment by settlers and soldiers. Our team has been in regular contact with him since the documentary and over the last 24 hours. We are continuing to monitor the situation. https://t.co/asEWKkVX5h\u2014 Louis Theroux (@louistheroux) May 4, 2025The BBC documentary, a follow-up to Theroux\u2019s 2012 film The Ultra Zionists, reflects on how the situation has evolved in occupied Palestinian territory.While conducting interviews with Palestinian and Israeli figures, the documentary explored how the settler population has grown significantly and how new military outposts and Israeli infrastructure have expanded across Palestinian territories, often with direct state support.It delves into the religious and ideological motivations behind the Israeli expansion, which has led to mass displacement of Palestinians and violent clashes, and it questions the legality and morality of the occupation as courts rule that it undermines international laws and norms.\u201cYou bring Jewish families [to the occupied West Bank], you live Jewish life, and this will bring light instead of darkness. And this is how the state of Israel was established, and this is what we want to do in Gaza,\u201d Daniella Weiss, a key member of the Israeli settler movement for decades, says in the documentary.Weiss, who has enjoyed support from a number of Israeli rabbis as well, said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is \u201chappy\u201d about the settler expansion. Netanyahu has opposed the Palestinian sovereignty over Gaza and occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.Settlers are Israeli citizens who live on private Palestinian land in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. They now number more than 700,000. All Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law.Settlements and their expansions are seen as the biggest hurdle in the realisation of a sovereign and independent Palestinian state living side by side with Israel.The United Nations General Assembly last year called on Israel to end its occupation of Palestinian territory. This came months after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that the Israeli presence in Palestinian territory is \u2018\u201dunlawful\u201d.Theroux himself was harassed as well when making part of the documentary in Hebron when Israeli soldiers approached him and tried to make him leave the area.The harassment of Amro comes shortly after Hamdan Ballal, the Palestinian co-director of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, was attacked by Israeli settlers in his home in the West Bank village of Susya.Armed and masked settlers vandalised his home and vehicle in late March and injured Ballal. While receiving treatment in an ambulance, Israeli soldiers blindfolded and arrested the filmmaker, who was later released without charge.Like the harassment of Amro on Saturday, that attack was also seen as retaliation for the documentary\u2019s international acclaim and its efforts to show the struggles of Palestinians in the West Bank.The incidents have also further highlighted the dangers faced by journalists and filmmakers under Israeli occupation at a time when Israel has killed more than 200 media workers in the Gaza Strip."}

Eight people were injured, according to paramedics.Israeli media reported that the advanced US-made THAAD system and Israel\u2019s long-range Arrow defence system failed to bring down the missile.Writing on social media, Netanyahu said that attacks from the Houthis ultimately \u201cemanate from Iran\u201d.\u201cIsrael will respond to the Houthi attack against our main airport AND, at a time and place of our choosing, to their Iranian terror masters,\u201d Netanyahu wrote.The Israeli prime minister has been trying to drum up support for a joint attack with the United States against Iran, despite ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran.Responding to Israel\u2019s threats, Iran\u2019s Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh said that Tehran would strike back if the US or Israel attacked.\u201cIf this war is intiated by the US or the Zionist regime [Israel], Iran will target their interests, bases and forces \u2013 wherever they may be and whenever deemed necessary,\u201d Nasirzadeh told Iranian state television.Nasirzadeh also said that Yemen\u2019s Houthis made their own decisions when conducting attacks.The rebel group, which has been carrying out attacks against Israel in stated opposition to its war and blockade on the Gaza Strip, claimed responsibility for the missile launched at Israel\u2019s busiest airport. More than 18 months of Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed at least  52,495 people, including 57 who starved to death due to the total Israeli siege since March 2, according to Palestinian officials.In a televised statement, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree warned airlines that Ben Gurion airport was \u201cno longer safe for air travel\u201d.The attack led to a brief suspension of flights at the airport in central Israel with some having to be redirected. All entrances to the airport were also briefly closed while train journeys towards the site were halted.A number of major airlines, including German carrier Lufthansa, Spanish airline Air Europa, Air France, SWISS, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Air India and Hungary\u2019s Wizz Air announced they were cancelling flights for Sunday, with some cancelling flights on Monday and Tuesday as well.The Houthis called on airlines flying to Israel to \u201ctake into consideration\u201d that it would \u201cimpose a comprehensive air blockade on [Israel] by repeatedly targeting\u2026 Ben-Gurion Airport\u201d.Sirens blared across central Israel, prompting many to move into shelters, according to Israeli media.Videos of the site of the impact circulating online showed the missile hit a connecting road inside the perimeter of the airport with some debris scattered on adjacent roads.Before his social media post, Netanyahu had promised to retaliate against the Houthis and continue the war on Gaza.In a video message in Hebrew, he said Israel and the US will \u201cact against them again in the future\u201d and do so using more than one blow. He also vowed \u201cthere will be no Hamas\u201d in Gaza.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened severe retaliation, too. \u201cWhoever attacks us, we will hit back sevenfold,\u201d Katz said in an apparent reference in the Torah relating to severe punishment, or divine justice.Benny Gantz, leader of the Israel Resilience party and a former war cabinet member, said the blame for the missile attack by the Iran-aligned group should be put on Tehran.\u201cIt is Iran that is firing ballistic missiles at the state of Israel, and it must bear responsibility,\u201d he said in a social media post without providing evidence. \u201cThe shooting at the state of Israel is bound to lead to a severe reaction in Tehran.\u201dYair Golan, a leading opposition figure, said millions of Israelis are in shelters again, Israeli captives held in Gaza are dying, the cost of living is crushing families and reservists are \u201ccollapsing under the burden\u201d of the war, which was launched after an attack headed by the Palestinian armed group Hamas in Israel on October 7, 2023, led to the killing of an estimated 1,139 people, with more than 200 taken captive.\u201cThis is big for Netanyahu, this is big for the government,\u201d Golan said about the prime minister. \u201cWe must return the kidnapped people home and end the war.\u201dHouthi attacks are continuing despite near daily bombardment of areas across Yemen by the United States military. Houthi-run media reported many more US air raids on Yemen early on Sunday, as well as after the attack on Ben Gurion airport.After the missile hit the airport, Al Masirah TV reported US air raids on the Khab and ash-Shaaf district of al-Jawf governorate.At dawn, US warplanes launched 10 raids on the al-Hazm district of the al-Jawf governorate and three attacks on the Marib governorate. More attacks hit Saada\u2019s Takhya region as well.It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties as with some of the other US strikes this week, including one on a migrant detention centre that killed dozens of people."}

Ending the fleeting ceasefire, which saw Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Israeli captives earlier this year, has not led to any more releases.A video circulated by Hamas on Saturday purported to show one of the Israeli captives, whom local media identified as Maxim Herkin. In the four-minute video posted online, Herkin is seen being rescued by Hamas members after an Israeli attack struck a tunnel, burying and injuring the Israeli captive.Families of the captives released a statement saying they spent the Sabbath gripped by \u201cexcruciating anxiety\u201d after news of the government\u2019s planned escalation and the effect it could have on those still held in Gaza.The Bring Them Home Campaign, a group representing the relatives, condemned the move as reckless.\u201cIsrael is on its way to sinking into the Gaza mud in the name of the illusion that it is possible to achieve any victory without returning our brothers and sisters from captivity,\u201d the group said in a post on X. \u201cExpanding the fighting will endanger the kidnapped, the living and the dead alike.\u201dThey urged Netanyahu to abandon the offensive and instead reach an agreement that would secure the captives\u2019 return. \u201cStop this mistake,\u201d the group said.Speaking to Al Jazeera, Israeli journalist Gideon Levy said the protest movement remains consistent, but lacks the momentum to challenge Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. \u201cIt\u2019s the same old protest, very courageous and devoted, but not big enough to influence Netanyahu,\u201d Levy said.He noted that a large segment of Israeli society continues to support the war effort, even amid rising frustration from the captives\u2019 families, and that \u201cwhen [Israelis] are called to war, they will obey.\u201dNetanyahu, speaking Thursday at a public event in Jerusalem, seemed to suggest that defeating Hamas remains Israel\u2019s top priority instead of the release of captives. \u201cWe want to bring all our hostages home,\u201d he said. \u201cThe war has a supreme goal, and the supreme goal is victory over our enemies, and this we will achieve.\u201dCaptives\u2019 families have accused Netanyahu of undermining previous attempts to reach a truce and swap deal. Some believe his refusal to compromise reflects political motives, aimed at ensuring the survival of his far-right coalition government, rather than genuine concern for the captives."}

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed responsibility for the attack, calling it a response to Israeli operations in Gaza.The Houthis have increasingly targeted Israel and shipping routes in the Red Sea, stating that their actions are acts of solidarity with Palestinians as Israel continues its assault on Gaza and the occupied West Bank.The Houthis did not carry out attacks during the Gaza ceasefire earlier this year until Israel blocked all aid into the besieged enclave in early March and followed that with a full resumption of the war.In the meantime, Houthi-affiliated Al Masirah TV reported on Saturday that the US launched two air raids on Yemen\u2019s Kamaran Island and as-Salif district in the port city of Hodeidah.The new attacks come a day after the same news outlet reported seven US attacks on the Ras Isa oil port in as-Salif district in Hodeidah. Last month, a US strike on the same port killed at least 80 people and wounded 150 in one of the deadliest attacks on the country by US forces.The US has also ramped up its air campaign in Yemen, launching its most extensive military operations in the Middle East since President Donald Trump assumed office in January.US forces claim to have struck Houthi positions, however, there have been numerous civilian casualties.The high civilian toll from US strikes is drawing increasing alarm. The UK-based monitor Airwars reported that between 27 and 55 civilians were killed in March alone. April\u2019s deaths are expected to be higher.Houthi sources say at least 68 African migrants died in a single overnight strike on Monday, with additional casualties reported around the capital.As the conflict intensifies, political instability is growing within Yemen.Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak, the prime minister of the internationally recognised government, announced his resignation on Saturday, citing persistent challenges, including his inability to reshuffle the cabinet.Government insiders said a power struggle with Presidential Council leader Rashad al-Alimi triggered Mubarak\u2019s departure.Within hours of the announcement, the presidential council named Finance Minister Salem Saleh bin Braik as prime minister, according to the state-run SABA news agency. The council also named bin Mubarak as an adviser to the ruling body, without addressing his claims.Mubarak\u2019s political career has been closely linked to the long-running war in Yemen. He rose to prominence after being abducted by Houthi fighters in 2015 while serving as chief of staff to then-president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.Much of the international community does not recognise the Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah (supporters of God), even though the armed Iran-aligned group controls most parts of Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa, and some of the western and northern areas close to Saudi Arabia."}

More than 9,000 children have been admitted to hospital for treatment for acute malnutrition since the start of the year, according to the United Nations.Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera\u2019s Hani Mahmoud said he had witnessed heartbreaking scenes of children rifling through rubbish, \u201clooking for whatever is left of canned food products\u201d. The enclave, he added, had reached a \u201ccritical\u201d point with international organisations out of supplies and community kitchens unable to prepare meals for displaced people.\u201cFinding a single meal has become an impossible quest,\u201d Ahmad al-Najjar, a displaced Palestinian in Gaza City, told Al Jazeera. \u201cPeople here have witnessed one charity after another declaring they\u2019re out of supplies, that they\u2019re shutting down their operations because they\u2019re in no position to \u2026 offer the population the needed relief.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating and infuriating to have trucks piling up on the other side of the fence be denied entrance while the people, even children, are in dire conditions.\u201dSuhaib al-Hams, the director of the Kuwaiti Hospital in Rafah, said in a statement that medical services were experiencing \u201cacute shortages in more than 75 percent of essential medicines\u201d, with only around a week of supplies left.He warned that most of the enclave\u2019s medical services will stop without \u201cimmediate intervention\u201d to reopen borders and allow medical and humanitarian aid through. He added that patients, who are \u201cslowly dying every day without treatment\u201d, needed to be evacuated urgently.The continued blockade is the longest such closure the Gaza Strip has ever faced, and has come as Israeli forces continue bombarding the territory, killing at least 70 Palestinians and wounding 275 others over the two days spanning Thursday to Saturday morning, according to the Health Ministry.On Saturday, two women were killed in an Israeli air raid on a house in the town of al-Fakhari near Gaza\u2019s southern city of Khan Younis, according to reports from Al Jazeera Arabic.Separately, a fisherman was killed and another injured by an Israeli naval attack off the coast of Gaza City.Later in the day, two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli drone attack on southern Gaza\u2019s al-Mawasi area, once an Israeli-designated \u201csafe zone\u201d.Israel\u2019s war on Gaza has killed at least 52,495 people and wounded 118,366 since October 7, 2023, according to the Health Ministry.

Orthopaedic surgeon Anas Hijjawi described a long line of doctors who had signed up for medical missions to Gaza, some of whom had to wait up to five months for a spot on a mission to open up.Dr Diyaa Rachdan, an ophthalmic surgeon, struggles to keep his voice steady as he tells Al Jazeera that Tuesday was the last day of the mission and the doctors would be heading back to their respective hospitals the next day.\u201cBut I am hoping that there will be more, longer trips to Gaza in the future,\u201d he adds.Their work in Gaza is not easy, but that is not the reason these doctors are sad to be leaving their mission behind. On the contrary, every day is a struggle as they try to cope with a volume of deaths, illnesses and injuries they simply do not have the equipment to address.Israel has often prevented the entry of hospital supplies into Gaza during the course of its nearly 19-month-long war on the besieged enclave. Medical missions are not allowed to bring anything in with them.So, the doctors struggle on with the equipment they can find, sometimes reusing \u201cdisposable\u201d medical implements over and over, despite the danger that poses, because there is simply no other choice, Dr Rachdan says.At the back of their minds, several doctors tell Al Jazeera, is always the thought that people in Gaza die of wounds and illnesses that would be easily treated in any other hospital that has adequate supplies.\u201cSometimes we can\u2019t cover a patient or take precautions to preserve the sterility of an operating room,\u201d Dr Hijjawi says.\u201cSometimes I don\u2019t have the right size metal plates or screws that I need to mend a limb. I\u2019ve had to use the wrong size item \u2026 just to get them better enough that they could, some day, travel for more treatment.\u201dWhile doctors coming into Gaza have often followed developments there closely before arrival, nothing, they tell Al Jazeera, could have prepared them for the level of destruction the people of Gaza have to cope with.\u201cWords can\u2019t describe the pain people are in here, or the level of exhaustion of the medical teams. They\u2019ve been working nearly around the clock for a year and a half now, despite their own personal pain and tragedies,\u201d says the fourth Qatar-based volunteer, urology consultant Mohammad Almanaseer.There\u2019s a tentativeness in Dr Almanaseer\u2019s voice as he speaks of the case that has impacted him the most deeply, the story of a little boy of about two years old who was brought into the emergency room after Israel had bombed him and his family.\u201cThe usual resuscitation attempts were made with him, but he needed immediate surgery. I was in the operating room, assisting the paediatric surgeon, but it became clear to us that the child probably wouldn\u2019t survive.\u201dThe child died the next morning.\u201cHe was the same age as my son, and even had the same name. Kinan, little Kinan, may God receive you and your mother, who was killed in the same bombing, by his side.\u201dInjuries as extreme and urgent as Kinan\u2019s are what the medical teams deal with day in and day out, resulting in a large swath of patients who need less urgent care and who keep getting pushed down the list.Like the patients who have been waiting for months or years for cataract surgery, some of whom were helped by Dr Rachdan during this mission.The people of Gaza have been forced to carry on throughout the genocidal war on their existence. This strength has inspired a sort of bewildered regard among the visiting volunteer doctors.Dr Hijjawi tells of an afternoon chat with an operating room nurse who was explaining how he struggles to get to work every day and how he says a final farewell to his wife and children every day, because he never knows what may happen to any of them.\u201cThen, we heard ambulances coming in,\u201d Dr Hijjawi continues, \u201cand we went to muster in the emergency room. Suddenly, the OR nurse came running past us, desperately asking for an ambulance to go to his house with him because he had heard it had been bombed.\u201cIt took some time \u2026 but they finally went out and came back with his parents, who had been killed, and the rest of his family, who had injuries among them. And, you know what? Just two days after this happened to him, he\u2019s here, he\u2019s upstairs working.\u201dAll four doctors seem to have a soft spot for their paediatric patients. It is the children\u2019s pain that affects them the most, and it is their suffering that they will take away with them in their memories.Al Jazeera follows Dr Almanaseer on his rounds as he visits a young girl in intensive care. She is recovering from severe burns on much of her face and body. In quiet tones, she asks him about whether she will be left with big scars from the burns.The doctor answers her quietly and seriously, taking time to talk to her until it seems like she\u2019s reassured for today.Dr Hijjawi is also on his rounds, speaking to a little girl, gently examining her leg and asking her to \u201clift both feet off the bed for me\u201d. Then he asks a little boy to wiggle his toes so he can check on how he\u2019s healing.Next is a young girl lying under a recovery blanket in a room on her own. Her right arm is bandaged, which is what he\u2019s there to look at.He squats on the floor near her bed and moves her arm, then each of her fingers. He\u2019s concerned because she seems to have lost sensation in two fingers and feels the problem will have to be explored surgically, as he tells a concerned relative.The children are quiet, wide-eyed, doing as they\u2019re told and not saying much else.\u201cThere\u2019s so much they\u2019re dealing with,\u2019 Hijjawi says. \u201cBeing in the hospital is scary, but on top of that, so many of them are just lying there waiting, hoping, for someone to visit them \u2013 a parent or grandparent or sibling. Some of them don\u2019t know who\u2019s left alive from their family outside the hospital walls.\u201cAdd all that to their physical pain, yes, they are very quiet for very long periods, or their minds seem to wander,\u201d he says quietly.Dr Rachdan is holding fast to one memory of Gaza\u2019s children that he seems to want to preserve as he gets ready to leave: \u201cOne thing that I don\u2019t think I will ever forget is the sight of the children in Gaza who continue playing, despite the destruction.\u201cThey make paper aeroplanes, play ball, despite the tragedy they are surrounded by. I will always remember that.\u201d"}

But it has not led to any more releases since the fleeting ceasefire earlier this year, which saw Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Israeli captives.Meanwhile, Hamas official Abdel Rahman Shadid on Friday accused Israel of using starvation as a \u201cdeliberate weapon of war\u201d against Palestinians.\u201cChildren are dying from the lack of milk, not just from bombs,\u201d Shadid said in a statement published on the group\u2019s Telegram channel.Legal experts and human rights groups have noted that, as an occupying power, Israel has an obligation under international law to provide food and other assistance to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.They have condemned the blockade as a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians of all ages are experiencing high levels of food insecurity in Gaza, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system, a global hunger watchdog.Amjad Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, told Al Jazeera that the situation is worsening quickly as health facilities lack the supplies needed to treat children grappling with malnutrition.\u201cWe have no food supplies or supplementary materials or medications for these children,\u201d Shawa told Al Jazeera from Gaza City. \u201cThere is high concern that we will witness more casualties in the coming few days,\u201d he added.At Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, Dr Ahmed Abu Nasir said the situation has become worse than ever due to the blockade.\u201cChildren are in their growing stage and badly need certain nutrients, including proteins and fats,\u201d the paediatrician told Al Jazeera. \u201cThese are not available in the Gaza Strip, particularly in the north.\u201dMore than 52,400 Palestinians have been killed since Israel\u2019s war on Gaza began in October 2023, according to figures from the Gaza Health Ministry."}

Alfayoumi, meanwhile, was stabbed 26 times. He did not survive.Czuba\u2019s trial featured audio from Shaheen\u2019s panicked 911 call, as well as testimony from the mother herself. Speaking from the witness stand in English and Arabic, she described Czuba becoming increasingly paranoid and Islamophobic as the war progressed.For nearly two years before the attack, the family had rented a pair of bedrooms in Czuba\u2019s house in Plainville, Illinois, just outside of Chicago.But after the war began on October 7, Shaheen recalled Czuba telling her to move out of her lodgings because Muslims were not welcome.Then, during the attack, she once again heard him citing her Muslim faith. \u201cHe told me \u2018You, as a Muslim, must die,\u2019\u201d said Shaheen.The incident was one of the highest-profile acts of anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab and anti-Muslim violence in the US after the war in Gaza broke out.But advocates say it is part of a trend of anti-Palestinian and Islamophobic hate that has swept the country in recent months.After the attack, police found Czuba sitting on the ground outside of the home, his hands and body bloody. Czuba pleaded not guilty, and his defence team has sought to vacate his conviction on the grounds that the prosecution played to the jury\u2019s emotions.Some of the images of the crime scene were so graphic that the judge ordered the court\u2019s television screens to be turned away from the audience. Jury members heard Shaheen telling 911 operators in fear, \u201cThe landlord is killing me and my baby!\u201dDuring his opening statements, Michael Fitzgerald, the assistant state\u2019s attorney for Will County, described Alfayoumi\u2019s final moments as full of horror.\u201cHe could not escape,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t enough that this defendant killed that little boy, he left the knife in the little boy\u2019s body.\u201dIn February, the jury took less than 90 minutes to return a guilty verdict.On Friday, Judge Bertani-Tomczak rejected the defence\u2019s bid to overturn the conviction. In announcing the sentence, she called Czuba\u2019s actions \u201cbrutal\u201d and \u201cheinous\u201d.She said a 30-year prison sentence was given for Alfayoumi\u2019s murder, plus another 20 years for the attack on his mother and three years for committing a hate crime.Alfayoumi\u2019s great-uncle, Mahmoud Yousef, was the only family member to speak at the sentencing hearing. He said no amount of prison time could ever make up for the loss his family has suffered.He also explained that Alfayoumi had seen Czuba as a grandfather figure, and he questioned what \u201cfake news\u201d about the war in Gaza could have prompted such violence.\u201cSome people are bringing this war to this country,\u201d Yousef said. \u201cWe cannot do that. We can\u2019t bring the war here. We cannot bring hatred to this country.\u201dThe American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) also responded to the sentencing by calling on Americans to reject hate and prejudice.\u201cThis sentencing brings closure to the case, and a measure of accountability and justice to a tragedy that has shaken our community,\u201d the group\u2019s executive director Abed Ayoub said in a statement. \u201cWe must come together to ensure that tragedies fueled by anti-Arab, anti-Palestinian hate, and Islamophobia are never accepted as the norm in our society.\u201dIn March, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) issued a report saying it had received 8,658 complaints of anti-Muslim and anti-Arab incidents in the last year alone, a 7.6 percent rise.It was the highest tally the group had recorded since it began collecting data in 1996."}

But the question, now, is what are these states going to do about it?\u201d he told Al Jazeera.He noted the UK had used the recent hearings to denounce Israel\u2019s obstruction of aid and to speak about its decision to halt arms sales to Israel, not enough of an action, he added.France also spoke about the need for Israel to quickly facilitate aid into Gaza.But the statements appear to be attempts to substitute for Europe\u2019s collective failure to take urgent action against Israel for its conduct in Gaza, said Haque.\u201cThe onus is on states to decide what they are going to do about [Israel\u2019s actions] and not to wait for the court to rule on what they already know,\u201d Haque added.The ICJ is not expected to issue an advisory opinion for months.The non-binding advisory opinion will likely not compel Israel or member states to change course, according to legal scholars.Israel has ignored an earlier binding provisional measures by the ICJ ordering it to scale up humanitarian aid and end acts of genocide in Gaza as a result of a genocide case brought against Israel by South Africa in December 2023.No state has taken any action against Israel for failing to implement the provisional measures.McIntyre believes the court will eventually issue a narrow ruling that outlines Israel\u2019s responsibilities to facilitate aid and cooperate with UNRWA.By the time the court issues its opinion, tens of thousands of Palestinians may have already starved to death, or been ethnically cleansed by Israel.\u201cThe advisory opinion won\u2019t solve the problem on the ground and genuine action [by states] needs to be taken,\u201d warned McIntyre."}

The military added that the outcome of the second interception was still under review.Yahya Saree, spokesperson for the Houthis \u2013 also known as Ansar Allah \u2013 confirmed the group had carried a \u201cmilitary operation\u201d against a key Israeli military target.Saree said hypersonic missiles were used and had successfully hit their intended destination.The Israeli army responded that \u201cinterception attempts were made\u201d without providing further details.The Houthi group has repeatedly said its attacks on Israel as well as United States and British ships in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandeb Strait will only cease if Israel agrees to a permanent Gaza truce.The Houthis did not carry out attacks during the Gaza ceasefire earlier this year until Israel blocked all aid into the besieged enclave in early March and followed that with a full resumption of the war.The attacks come as the US escalates its military operations in Yemen.On Friday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth extended the USS Harry S Truman\u2019s deployment in the Middle East for an additional week, ensuring two carrier strike groups remain operational in the region, a Pentagon official confirmed anonymously to The Associated Press news agency.Since March, the US has launched large-scale attacks not only on infrastructure but increasingly on individuals linked to the Houthi leadership.Civilian casualties are mounting, with UK-based monitor Airwars estimating between 27 and 55 civilians were killed in March alone, and suggesting April\u2019s toll is even higher.On Monday, at least 68 people were killed in the overnight strike on detained African migrants, and eight people were killed around the capital, Houthi media reported.Rights advocates have been alarmed about the growing civilian death toll. Three US Democratic senators recently wrote to Hegseth, demanding an accounting of civilian lives lost.\u201cStrikes pose a growing risk to the civilian population in Yemen,\u201d United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Monday. \u201cWe continue to call on all parties to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians.\u201d"}

Reform hopes to ride growing support to unbalance the United Kingdom\u2019s political system, which is traditionally dominated by the governing Labour Party and opposition Conservatives.\u201cIt\u2019s been a huge night for Reform,\u201d said Reform leader Nigel Farage after the party was declared winner of the seat of Runcorn and Helsby.The victory in northwest England, previously a Labour stronghold, came by just six votes.Reform also prevailed in a mayoral race in Greater Lincolnshire and picked up dozens of council seats from Labour and the Conservatives in the first polls since general elections last year.The results appear to underline the fracturing of the UK\u2019s political landscape.Prime Minister Keir Starmer led Labour to one of the largest parliamentary majorities in British history in last year\u2019s election but has gone on to suffer the fastest decline in popularity of any newly elected government.Brexit champion Farage, a populist who has allied himself in the past with United States President Donald Trump, noted that the win in Runcorn and Helsby, which Labour won in last year\u2019s national election with a majority of almost 15,000 votes, showed that the ruling party\u2019s vote had \u201ccollapsed\u201d.Labour has lost support as the government has raised taxes, cut benefits for the elderly and proposed sweeping welfare reforms, alienating the left-wing party\u2019s traditional voter base and driving some into the arms of Reform.In Greater Lincolnshire, newly elected mayor Andrea Jenkyns, a former Conservative minister who defected to Reform after losing her seat last year, became the party\u2019s most powerful elected politician yet, with responsibility for an area covering about a million people.In her victory speech, Jenkyns pledged to bring an end to \u201csoft-touch Britain\u201d and said asylum seekers should be held in tents, not in hotels as they often are in the country.\u201cThe rebuilding begins here \u2026 we\u2019re going to have a Britain where we put British people first,\u201d she said.Reform UK is the latest in a series of parties led by Farage, a veteran hard-right politician who was crucial in taking the UK out of the European Union through a 2016 referendum. A divisive figure, he has said many migrants come to the UK from cultures \u201calien to ours\u201d.Reform, which has pledged to \u201cstop the boats\u201d of irregular migrants crossing the English Channel, is hoping that winning mayoralties and gaining councillors would help it build its grassroots activism before the next general election \u2013 likely in 2029.The party hopes to scoop up hundreds of municipal seats in the elections that are deciding 1,641 seats on 23 local councils and six mayoralties, as well as the parliamentary seat.Ballots in most of those contests are being counted on Friday and results should be announced in the afternoon."}

Medical sources told Al Jazeera that 22 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli air raids since dawn, with attacks on the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza and the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood in the northwest of Gaza City."}

Free him now.\u201dThose words rang outside a federal courthouse near Washington, DC, on Thursday, as lawyers argued over the case of Badar Khan Suri, who has been detained by the United States government over his support for Palestinian rights.Dozens of activists had gathered to show solidarity with Khan Suri, a postdoctoral scholar at Georgetown University. He was arrested in March as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to punish and deport non-citizens accused of fuelling \u201canti-Semitism\u201d and \u201cillegal protests\u201d on college campuses.Speaking to the crowd in Alexandria, Virginia, Mapheze Saleh \u2013 Khan Suri\u2019s Palestinian American wife \u2013 highlighted the impact of his detention on their three children. She said they just wanted their father back.\u201cWhy is this happening to him? Why is the Trump administration persecuting him?\u201d Saleh said. \u201cBecause he fell in love and married to a Palestinian, because he dared to express his belief in non-violence and because he spoke out bravely against the genocide of my people in Gaza.\u201dBefore his detention, Khan Suri was in the US on an academic visa, conducting research on peace-building in Iraq and Afghanistan.But the US government has accused Khan Suri, an Indian national, of violating the terms of his visa by \u201cactively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media\u201d. It has not offered proof of either assertion.Outside the courthouse on Thursday, Amanda Eisenhour, an activist from Alexandria, said Khan Suri\u2019s case represents the intersection of issues including free speech, constitutional rights and the \u201ctyranny\u201d of the US immigration system.\u201cIt\u2019s also about Palestine,\u201d Eisenhour told Al Jazeera. \u201cI want to make sure that\u2019s always part of the conversation. Dr Khan Suri is a political prisoner because of his association, because of his marriage to somebody who\u2019s Palestinian. We\u2019re now a country that holds political prisoners, and we have to be ready to fight against that.\u201dAs the legal hearing unfolded, activists outside chanted for Khan Suri\u2019s freedom and Palestinian rights under a statue of a blindfolded woman holding scales, symbolising justice without bias.One protester held up a sign, \u201cMob bosses disappear people.\u201d Another placard proclaimed, \u201cDue process now.\u201dIn the courtroom, lawyers for both sides questioned the geographical divide between where the hearing was taking place \u2013 and where Khan Suri is held presently.After his arrest in Virginia, immigration officials quickly moved Khan Suri from a local detention centre to one in Louisiana and then in Texas.Critics say the government has transferred individuals slated for deportation to faraway states to keep them away from their families and legal teams. They also point out that states like Louisiana and Texas are more likely to have conservative-leaning courts.On Thursday, Khan Suri\u2019s lawyers argued for the scholar to be moved back to his home state of Virginia, where his case is currently unfolding.\u201cWe hope the court sees through these unlawful government tactics, keeps Dr Suri\u2019s case here in Virginia, orders that he be released or, at minimum, orders that he be returned to Virginia, where he\u2019ll be close to his legal counsel and to his family,\u201d said Samah Sisay, staff lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights, which is involved in the case.But the Trump administration made an opposing request, pushing for the court case to be transferred to Texas.Ultimately, Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles demanded answers about why Khan Suri was moved so swiftly out of Virginia. She gave the government\u2019s lawyers 24 hours to respond.The Georgetown scholar\u2019s lawyers have reason to be optimistic about the outcome. Federal district courts have asserted jurisdiction in similar cases, and on Wednesday, a judge in Vermont ordered the release of Columbia University student Mohsen Mahdawi, who is also facing deportation.Since Trump began his second term in January, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has suggested that he revoked the visas of hundreds of foreign students who engaged in protests or criticism of Israel.But the push to deport Khan Suri has been one of the most prominent cases.To justify removing Khan Suri and other student activists, Rubio has cited the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, a Cold War-era law. One rarely used provision allows the secretary of state to deport non-citizens who pose \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign consequences\u201d for the US.The Trump administration has not charged Khan Suri with a crime. But officials have accused him of \u201cconnections to a known or suspected terrorist\u201d: his father-in-law.\u201cSuri was married to the daughter of a senior advisor for to [sic] Hamas terrorist group,\u201d the Department of Homeland Security said in a social media post.But Khan Suri\u2019s supporters point out that his father-in-law, Ahmed Yousef, has not been associated with Hamas for years and has even criticised the group on multiple occasions.Yousef had served more than a decade ago as an adviser to former Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, a Hamas leader who was killed by Israel in Iran last year.Regardless, legal experts say familial ties are not a criminal offence or grounds for deportation.Hassan Ahmad, a Virginia-based lawyer representing Khan Suri, said the allegation about the Georgetown scholar\u2019s father-in-law sets the case apart from the push to deport other pro-Palestine students.\u201cWe\u2019re talking not just about the First Amendment, freedom of speech. We\u2019re talking about the constitutional freedom of association as well,\u201d Ahmad said.\u201cAnd that\u2019s something that distinguishes Dr Suri\u2019s case, in that here they\u2019re going after him based on not anything that he said or retweeted or forwarded or liked or spoke to anyone [about], but based only on his association. That\u2019s not the America we want to be.\u201dEden Heilman, the legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Virginia, which is helping to represent Khan Suri, also said deporting someone based on their personal connections is a \u201cvery scary premise\u201d.\u201cIf that\u2019s what the government has done, which they are alleging they are doing with Dr Suri, we are in an unprecedented time in terms of our constitutional threats,\u201d Heilman told reporters on Thursday.Moreover, social media accounts that appear to belong to Khan Suri do not show any direct support for Hamas or hostility towards the Jewish people. Instead, the scholar has used his social media presence to decry Israeli atrocities in Gaza and highlight apparent war crimes against Palestinians.\u201cIsrael is bombing hospitals in Gaza to turn the land inhabitable, in order to build the case for making Palestinians in Gaza think of migrating to the Sinai desert,\u201d Khan Suri wrote in October 2023.In recent months, Trump has called for the removal of all Palestinians from Gaza, a plan that rights advocates say amounts to ethnic cleansing.Democratic Congressman Don Beyer, who represents a district in northern Virginia where Khan Suri lived, attended Thursday\u2019s hearing to show support.\u201cI\u2019ll be doing everything I can to help Dr Khan [Suri] and his family, and I encourage each one of us to do all that we can to tell these stories, to help educate the American people about what\u2019s happening in this threat to our Constitution, to our rights,\u201d Beyer said in a video message on Thursday.\u201cIt is Kafkaesque that somebody can be kidnapped without reason, without acknowledgement, without logic, without charges and taken off to be locked in a prison in Texas, not knowing what happens next.\u201dAnita Martineau, a Northern Virginia resident, told Al Jazeera people should not be \u201ckidnapped\u201d for their speech. She attended a protest outside the hearing, holding a poster that read, \u201cBring Khan Suri back now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely unconstitutional, and it needs to stop,\u201d Martineau said. \u201cAmerican people and anyone in this country, whether they\u2019re citizens or residents, they all need to stand up. We need to speak with one voice.\u201dMelissa Petisa, an activist with the group Alexandria for Palestinian Human Rights, also called for Khan Suri to be \u201creleased immediately\u201d. She added that Trump is targeting students as a tactic to distract from the escalating carnage in Gaza.\u201cWe\u2019re here because we want to show solidarity with Dr Suri,\u201d Petisa told Al Jazeera. \u201cWe\u2019re also here because we\u2019re showing solidarity with Palestine.\u201d"}

It depicts the realities of the unrelenting Israeli bombing campaign on Gaza, the unsafe \u201csafe zones,\u201d and arbitrary executions through the eyes of three families during the initial 15 months of the war.The film investigates the death of five-year-old Hind Rajab, who was waiting to be rescued from a car where her family members had already been shot dead. Two medics dispatched to rescue her were also killed, as verified by a forensic watchdog agency.Laila Al-Arian, executive producer of Fault Lines, stated, \u201cNo single piece can fully capture the scale of the atrocities in Gaza, but we aimed through investigative journalism and on-the-ground storytelling to offer a glimpse of what life has been like. We are honoured by this recognition because it helps bring more attention to a continuing story the world needs to see. Though we filmed this over a year ago, the horrors we documented remain a daily reality for more than 2 million Palestinians in Gaza.\u201dTo date, The Night Won\u2019t End has garnered multiple awards, including in the coveted International Current Affairs category at the Royal Television Society Awards in the United Kingdom, the Overseas Press Club prize for best TV, video or documentary about international affairs, and the long-form award from the Centre for Information Resilience Open-Source Film Awards.The One Day in Gaza film from the series Close Up is a compilation of videos recorded by 10 individuals in Gaza, who were asked to document moments throughout their day, thereby helping viewers understand the immense hardships and constant dangers faced by Palestinians living under the constant bombardment in Gaza.Juan Carlos Van Meek, director of digital innovation and programming, expressed his gratitude for awarding the team the Peabody Award, stating, \u201cI am immensely proud of our team\u2019s relentless efforts in amplifying the humanity of Palestinians living in Gaza under constant bombardment. Through the brave voices of people on the ground, we have captivated millions of viewers and helped sustain global attention on the ongoing genocide, ensuring their stories are not forgotten.\u201dThe recognition of these documentaries underscores Al Jazeera\u2019s commitment to highlighting the profound human experiences amid conflict.As the situation in Gaza continues to unfold, The Network remains dedicated to shedding light on the stories that matter, ensuring that the voices of those affected are heard on a global platform."}

We don\u2019t know what to do with our lives any more. We\u2019d rather die than live this kind of life.\u201dThe bombardment comes amid dire warnings about the humanitarian situation in the besieged territory, which has been under a total Israeli blockade for two months.Volker Turk, the UN human rights chief, said the conditions being imposed by Israel on Palestinians in Gaza are \u201cincreasingly incompatible with their continued existence as a group\u201d. He warned that starvation as a method of warfare could amount to a war crime.The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached a catastrophic level, with Palestinians teetering on the edge of mass starvation, according to Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum reporting from the ground.\u201cParents have literally started to skip meals and children are now eating spoiled food. Canned food has become a luxury,\u201d he said. Aid-supported bakeries have shut down due to severe shortages, while the World Food Programme has reportedly run out of stock, leaving soup kitchens overwhelmed and barely operational.\u201cLocals are calling for safe, sustained humanitarian corridors, but say meaningful aid can only enter when Israel permits it,\u201d he added. With the blockade now in its second month, many in Gaza feel they are not just enduring a humanitarian emergency but \u201can engineered misery\u201d that has unleashed famine on a devastating scale.Tom Fletcher, the UN\u2019s humanitarian chief, echoed those concerns on Thursday. \u201cAid, and the civilian lives it saves, should never be a bargaining chip,\u201d he said.\u201cBlocking aid kills. It inflicts cruel collective punishment.\u201d He criticised an Israeli proposal for private distribution of aid in Gaza, calling it insufficient and not aligned with basic humanitarian principles.\u201cTo the Israeli authorities, and those who can still reason with them, we say again: lift this brutal blockade. Let humanitarians save lives,\u201d he said.UN agencies, including UNRWA, said more than 3,000 aid trucks are stuck at the Gaza border, unable to deliver essential supplies. Some one million children are said to be at risk. \u201cThe siege must be lifted,\u201d UNRWA said in a post on X.Israel\u2019s obligations to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank are also the subject of a weeklong hearing at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), following a request for an advisory opinion from the UN General Assembly last year.In the fourth day of hearings on Thursday, Qatar\u2019s ambassador to the Netherlands, Mutlaq al-Qahtani, told the court Israel has continued its \u201cgenocidal war against the Palestinian people\u201d and increased settlement efforts in the occupied West Bank.Palestinians in Gaza continue to face \u201cfamine-like conditions\u201d as Israel continues to block \u201cany delivery of life-saving aid\u201d, said Mutlaq al-QahtaniIsrael has jeopardised the existence of the UN agency for Palestine refugees, UNRWA, which is the \u201cbackbone\u201d of humanitarian and development assistance in the occupied territory, added the Qatari diplomat."}

About 30 supporters gathered outside, chanting, \u201cFree our comrade!\u201d before being dispersed by riot police about 10pm (20:00 GMT).Khatib was then transferred to a nearby station. He was questioned without a lawyer and released about 5am (03:00 GMT).Khatib said he spent hours waiting in a cell before being asked for a few minutes about an incident in April 2024 during which he was attacked with a knife. There was also a brief trip to the hospital for nonurgent medication.\u201cThey were doing anything they could to keep me,\u201d Khatib told Al Jazeera.The Brussels Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office told Al Jazeera: \u201cMohammed Khatib was arrested as part of an investigation into events that took place in April 2024. He was released after questioning.\u201dA Palestinian refugee born in the Ein El Hilweh camp in Lebanon in 1990, Khatib fled to Belgium alone at age 19, claimed asylum and co-founded Samidoun one year later in 2011. Campaigning for the rights of Palestinians incarcerated in Israel is his sole occupation.Samidoun\u2019s stance on Israel-Palestine has led to Khatib being designated as a \u201cserious\u201d security threat by the Coordination Unit for Threat Analysis (CUTA), an independent body that reports to Belgium\u2019s justice and interior ministries.Khatib said officers on April 21 justified the arrest initially with the CUTA designation.It marked the second time he has been arrested. In October 2023, he was arrested at a demonstration after refusing to stop waving a Palestine flag.The latest detention was \u201cnothing in terms of what we are facing\u201d, he said, referring to efforts in some Western nations to curtail the pro-Palestine movement.Samidoun called the arrest \u201ca form of state harassment targeting a prominent leader, not only of Samidoun, but of the growing movement against the ongoing genocide in occupied Palestine\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to see it in that light,\u201d refugee and immigration lawyer Benoit Dhondt told Al Jazeera. \u201cA lot of people are living in a state of schizophrenia because of how invisible the genocide in Gaza is being made in Europe.\u201dMeanwhile, \u201cdisproportionate policing of the pro-Palestine movement makes it very difficult to understand what is actually happening,\u201d he said.The author and journalist David Cronin wrote in The Electronic Intifada: \u201cIf the Belgian authorities enjoy any success in muzzling Mohammed Khatib and Samidoun, then we have to ask: Who is next? All Palestine solidarity campaigners are at risk.\u201dIn May last year, police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse a peaceful protest outside the Israeli embassy in Brussels under instructions from Mayor Boris Dillies, who said the demonstration was unauthorised. An open letter signed by Amnesty International described the measure as \u201ccontrary to international law\u201d.Earlier that month, police had arrested about 40 protesters when a demonstration at the US embassy went overtime.In a report on the state of the right to protest published in July, Amnesty noted that administrative arrest \u201cis increasingly used to prevent people from participating in protests\u201d in Belgium.Human rights and immigration lawyer Helene Crokart told Al Jazeera that arrests \u201care not isolated incidents\u201d and \u201csometimes amount to outright intimidation\u201d.On October 15, then-State Secretary for Migration and Asylum Nicole De Moor, a Christian Democrat, announced a procedure to strip Khatib, who she called a \u201chate preacher\u201d, of asylum.\u201cEven if someone has already been recognised as a refugee but that person turns out to be an extremist, recognition can be withdrawn,\u201d she stated.On the same day, the United States and Canada blacklisted Samidoun, deeming it a \u201csham charity\u201d and accusing it of raising funds for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a designated \u201cterrorist\u201d organisation.Samidoun denied the allegation.Germany banned Samidoun in 2023, alleging it celebrated the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel. Khatib said, \u201cSome Palestinians were distributing baklava in the street. And we were there with the Samidoun flag.\u201dKhatib has also been banned from entering Switzerland for 10 years, which occurs only when an individual poses what is considered a \u201cconcrete\u201d threat to national security, according to a Swiss government spokesperson. He was not permitted to enter the Netherlands for a university talk in October.During the October 2023 attacks, 1,139 people were killed and more than 200 were taken captive into Gaza. Since then, Israel\u2019s latest war on Gaza has killed more than 52,000 people, including more than 17,000 children, in the besieged enclave. Israel has justified the onslaught as an attempt to crush Hamas.According to a CUTA spokesperson, Samidoun is classified as an \u201cextremist\u201d organisation, which \u201cis not a criminal offence\u201d.\u201cWe are more interested in keeping an eye on the leadership, the members, what they do and say, how they disrupt public order and what group they are potentially targeting,\u201d the spokesperson said.Belgium\u2019s right-wing government, appointed in February, is markedly more sympathetic to Israel than its predecessor.Prime Minister Bart De Wever of the New Flemish Alliance party said Belgium would not arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu despite an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant for his arrest on charges of crimes against humanity. Four months earlier, then-Liberal Premier Alexander De Croo stated the opposite.The coalition headed by De Wever intends to \u201cban dangerous radical organisations such as Samidoun due to their ties to terrorism or for spreading antisemitism\u201d, according to official documents.But a ban would likely take a long time to implement because Belgian positions depend on European Union and United Nations Security Council decisions.De Moor\u2019s successor, Anneleen Van Bossuyt, supports the initiative to revoke Khatib\u2019s refugee status. Such a decision is made independently by the commissioner general for refugees and stateless persons and must rely on proof of a serious crime.A decision to strip someone\u2019s status may be appealed, but once finalised, the immigration office could issue an order for a person to leave the country.The case depends on material that authorities said they are not sharing, even with Khatib.Dhondt warned of a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on freedom of expression.The government is using Khatib\u2019s case as a \u201cpropaganda tool\u201d to demonstrate strong policies on \u201cextremism\u201d, he said, even though it \u201ccan\u2019t really say why [Khatib poses any threat]\u201d.Khatib denies all allegations of hate speech.\u201cIf they had something they could use against me, I would not be sitting here. I would be in prison.\u201cThe goal of this intimidation is to silence the movement, to make an example of us and say, \u2018If you do the same, this is your future\u2019. We will fight this.\u201dKhatib has previously called for Israel to be \u201cdismantled\u201d and said, \u201cWe do not call Hamas\u2019s attack in Israel a terror attack. We call it justified resistance.\u201dSeen as hardline positions by some, mainstream activists have distanced themselves from Samidoun but urged Brussels to uphold freedom of expression.The Human Rights League, a nonprofit organisation that has criticised Belgian authorities for allowing the transit of arms to Israel, does not wholly endorse Khatib\u2019s views but \u201creiterates the need to protect freedom of expression, including for statements that \u2018offend, shock or disturb\u2019, according to the European Court of Human Rights\u201d.\u201cWhile the positions defended by Mohammed Khatib and Samidoun can undeniably be described as radical, \u2026 to our knowledge they have never been prosecuted for any criminal offence (including for anti-Semitic statements) nor have they caused any public disorder,\u201d the rights group said in a 2024 report.The group linked Khatib\u2019s case to other measures, such as local bans on keffiyehs and other pro-Palestine symbols and the temporary suspension of decisions on Palestinian asylum applications. The report concluded that the lack of a decision on revoking Khatib\u2019s refugee status suggests insufficient evidence against him.The Union of Progressive Jews in Belgium last year denounced a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against Khatib.\u201cWhatever political differences we may have, this threat is intolerable and shakes the very foundations of our democracy.\u201d"}

A video of him being led away in handcuffs has been shared widely across social media.His arrest came as part of a wider push by the Trump administration to target visa holders and permanent residents for their pro-Palestine advocacy. Trump has also pressured top universities to crack down on pro-Palestine protests, in the name of combating anti-Semitism.Critics, however, say that rationale is an excuse to exert greater control over academia and stifle opposing views.Mohsen Mahdawi was just released on bail by a federal judge in Vermont. pic.twitter.com/sgtNyfeYmU\u2014 Katherine Franke (@ProfKFranke) April 30, 2025Jamil Sbitan, a friend of Mahdawi and a doctoral student at Columbia University, expressed relief at the activist\u2019s release, describing it as a \u201cglimmer of hope in extremely dark times\u201d.\u201cMohsen was detained in order to silence his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and against the genocide in Gaza, which has been funded and abetted by the US,\u201d Sbitani told Al Jazeera. \u201cBut this goes way beyond Palestine, because the Trump administration is using Palestine as a wedge issue to silence all forms of speech which the administration disapproves of,\u201d he said.That is why the judgement on Wednesday \u201creally sets positive precedent for the Palestine movement in the US, but also for free speech at large in this country\u201d, Sbitani added.In the ruling, the judge ruled that Mahdawi posed no flight risk and could be released while the immigration case against him proceeds.This means he will be attending his graduation next month in New York City.It is possible the US government may appeal Mahdawi\u2019s release, but the judge\u2019s ruling allows him to leave the state of Vermont and fight his deportation from outside a detention facility.During the court proceedings, the Trump administration had opposed his release, arguing that Mahdawi\u2019s detention was a \u201cconstitutionally valid aspect of the deportation process\u201d.Mahdawi\u2019s lawyers have countered that his detainment treads on his constitutional rights to free speech.\u201cMohsen has committed no crime, and the government\u2019s only supposed justification for holding him in prison is the content of his speech,\u201d Lia Ernst, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who is representing Mahdawi, said in a statement following his release.The Trump administration has taken the broad position that constitutional speech protections only apply to US citizens, a question that could eventually be decided by the US Supreme Court.In court filings, government lawyers have cited the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 as the legal basis for seeking Mahdawi\u2019s deportation.A rarely used part of the law allows the US to deport foreign nationals \u201cwhose presence or activities in the United States\u201d gives the secretary of state \u201creasonable ground to believe [they] would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\u201d.Secretary of State Marco Rubio has used that provision as the basis for seeking to deport Mahdawi and other pro-Palestinian student protesters. Israel is a critical ally of the US in the Middle East.Mahdawi was arrested weeks after fellow Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, also a US permanent resident.In early March, Khalil was likewise detained by immigration officials. The pair co-founded the Palestinian Student Union at the prestigious Ivy League university.Khalil has remained in immigration custody in Louisiana since his arrest outside his apartment. Earlier this month, an immigration judge ruled Khalil was indeed deportable, siding with government lawyers.In a two-page letter submitted to the court, Secretary of State Rubio had written that the 30-year-old should be removed from the US for his role in \u201cantisemitic protests and disruptive activities, which fosters a hostile environment for Jewish students in the United States\u201d.The Trump administration has broadly portrayed nearly all forms of pro-Palestine advocacy as \u201canti-Semitic\u201d, in what critics have called an effort to silence freedom of speech.Rubio provided no further evidence backing his claims against Khalil, and the student leader has been charged with no crime. Rubio\u2019s letter nevertheless said that his department can revoke a permanent resident\u2019s legal status even where their beliefs, associations or statements are \u201cotherwise lawful\u201d.On Tuesday, a federal judge ruled that Khalil can move forward with a legal challenge to his arrest and detainment on the grounds that he was targeted for his political views.Both Mahdawi and Khalil have parallel court cases, one seeking reprieve from deportation and the other challenging the basis for their arrests.While in detention, Mahdawi was visited by US Senator Peter Welch, a Democrat who has denounced the student\u2019s arrest as \u201cunjust\u201d and antidemocratic.\u201cI\u2019m staying positive by reassuring myself in the ability of justice and the deep belief of democracy,\u201d Mahdawi said at the time, according to a video posted on Welch\u2019s X account.\u201cThis is the reason I wanted to become a citizen of this country, because I believe in the principles of this country.\u201d"}

But Hamas has insisted on an Israeli commitment to a permanent ceasefire, saying any \u201cpartial deals\u201d will allow Israel to resume the killing in Gaza.Israel then abandoned the ceasefire and resumed bombarding Gaza on March 18, killing at least 2,308 people in attacks on tents, hospitals and school-turned-shelters. The death toll since October 2023, when the war began, has crossed 52,000 people. Another 118,014 have been wounded.Amid the intensified attacks and continued blockade, the global hunger watchdog, which is known as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system, has begun an analysis of food insecurity and malnutrition in the Gaza Strip.The assessment began on April 28 and will last one week, according to the United Nations\u2019s humanitarian agency (OCHA). More than 50 trained analysts from UN agencies and aid groups, from the Gaza Strip and abroad, are taking part in the exercise, it said.The IPC had issued at least four warnings since Israel\u2019s genocidal actions on Gaza began, saying the territory could be teetering on the precipice of famine.The assessment comes days after the World Food Programme (WFP) said its stocks in the enclave have been depleted. The agency had shut all of its bakeries in the Strip earlier in the month, over a lack of flour and fuel.Most families are surviving on less than a meal a day, and are resorting to eating \u201cwhatever they can find\u201d, even if it is not safe for consumption, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).Meanwhile, the large number of dead and wounded has overwhelmed the remaining partially functioning hospitals in Gaza, and medical staff warn that many are dying due to the shortage of medical supplies, according to Al Jazeera\u2019s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City.\u201cMedical staff warn there are many more dying quietly inside emergency wards of the remaining health facilities due to the shortage of medical supplies. Medications as simple as painkillers are not available,\u201d he said.The president of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, Younis al-Khatib, called for sanctions to be imposed on Israel as it \u201cleft no space for humanity to live in Gaza\u201d.\u201cI can\u2019t see my colleagues, my friends, and my staff being killed by a state that does not respect our emblem, does not respect international law,\u201d al-Khatib told Al Jazeera.\u201cIf any other state had done it, it would have been sanctioned.\u201dMeanwhile, in The Hague in the Netherlands, the ICJ continued its hearings on what Israel must do to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, following a request for an advisory opinion from the UN General Assembly last year.The United States defended Israel on Wednesday, saying that while it must provide aid to Gaza, it does not have to work with UNRWA. Israel banned the agency from operating on its territory in January, after alleging that 19 out of approximately 13,000 staff took part in Hamas\u2019s attack in southern Israel on October 7, 2023.Joshua Simmons, a legal adviser from the US State Department, argued there was \u201cno legal requirement that an occupying power permit a specific third state or international organisation to conduct activity that would compromise its security interests\u201d.Simmons suggested other organisations could fulfil UNRWA\u2019s mission, despite the UN agency having repeatedly stated that there could be no replacement for its role as an aid provider.Similar points were raised by Hungary as it took the floor in defence of Israel.The Russian Federation, which spoke directly after the US, said that UNRWA\u2019s work was crucial for the Palestinian people and the agency was supported by the majority of the international community.\u201cThe urgency of this matter cannot be overstated. Gaza balances on the brink of famine. Hospitals lie in ruins. Millions of Palestinians in the [Gaza] Strip, as well as in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, face existential despair,\u201d Maksim Musikhin, of Russia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told the court.Al Jazeera\u2019s Rory Challands, reporting from The Hague, said other countries, including Turkiye, France, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan and Kuwait, were expected to speak against Israel\u2019s aid blockade before the end of the day.Challands said the countries that gave statements to the court in the first two days of the hearings had all been critical of Israel\u2019s actions. \u201cIt was only at the beginning of the third day that a country turned up and spoke in defence of Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that, of course, was the US.\u201d"}

He also issued decrees to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement on climate and the World Health Organization, amongst other international forums.Trump continued to double down on a series of unconventional foreign policy proposals: taking over the Panama Canal, annexing Greenland, making Canada the 51st US state and \u201cowning\u201d Gaza.And despite promising to be a \u201cpeace\u201d president, Trump has said he intends to take the US annual Pentagon budget to a record $1 trillion.He has distanced himself from neo-conservative foreign policy and does not position himself as a promoter of human rights or democracy abroad. His \u201cAmerica First\u201d stance and scepticism of NATO align with realist principles, but his impulsiveness and highly personalised diplomacy diverge from traditional realism.At the same time, he has not called for a full military or diplomatic retreat from global affairs, setting him apart from isolationists.So what exactly drives Trump\u2019s foreign policy?Experts say it is primarily fuelled by a dissatisfaction with the current global system, which he sees as unfairly disadvantaging the US with its rules and restrictions. Instead, Trump appears to want Washington to leverage its enormous military and economic power to set the rules to assert global dominance while reducing US contributions and commitments to others.\u201cThe Trump doctrine is \u2018smash and grab\u2019, take what you want from others and let your allies do the same,\u201d said Josh Ruebner, a lecturer at Georgetown University\u2019s Program on Justice and Peace.Mathew Burrows, programme lead of the Strategic Foresight Hub at the Stimson Center think tank, said Trump wants US primacy without paying the costs that come with that.\u201cHe\u2019s withdrawing the US from the rest of the world, particularly economically,\u201d Burrows, a veteran of the US Department of State and CIA, told Al Jazeera.\u201cBut at the same time, he somehow believes that the US \u2026 will be able to tell other countries to stop fighting, to do whatever the US wants,\u201d he said. \u201cHegemony just doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201dTrump appears to believe that threatening and imposing tariffs \u2013 and occasionally violence \u2013 is a way of employing US leverage to get world leaders to acquiesce to his demands.But critics say the US president discounts the power of nationalism in other countries, which prompts them to eventually fight back. Such was the case for Canada.After Trump imposed tariffs and called for Canada to become the 51st state, this led to a wave of nationalist pride in the northern neighbour and an abrupt shift from the Conservative Party to the Liberal Party.From Canada to China, foreign governments have accused Trump of \u201cbullying\u201d and blackmail.Some of Trump\u2019s Democratic rivals have rushed to accuse him of abandoning the US global role, but at the same time, the US president has been projecting American strength to pressure other countries.While not entirely isolationist, his approach marks a significant turn from that of his predecessor.The late Secretary of State Madeleine Albright famously said in 1998: \u201cWe are the indispensable nation. We stand tall and we see further than other countries into the future.\u201dThat purported power and wisdom, as Albright envisioned, put the US in a position to implement Pax Americana \u2013 the concept of a peaceful global order led by Washington.Trump does see the US as proverbially taller than other nations, but perhaps not in the way Albright meant.\u201cAmerica does not need other countries as much as other countries need us,\u201d White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier this month.Her statement, however, was to stress that other nations must negotiate with the US to avoid Trump\u2019s tariffs.In this context, Trump is seeking revenues and jobs \u2013 not an international system governed by liberal values in the way that Washington defines them.However, Burrows said the chief aim of Trump\u2019s foreign policy is to dismantle the existing global order.\u201cA big part of his world view is really his negative feelings towards the current order, where others appear to be rising,\u201d Burrows said. \u201cAnd so, a lot of this is just tearing down.\u201dMuch of the system that manages relations between different countries was put in place after World War II, with the US leading the way.The United Nations and its agencies, the articles of international law, various treaties on the environment, nuclear proliferation and trade, and formal alliances have governed global affairs for decades.Critics of Washington point out that the US violated and opted out of the system where it saw fit.For example, the US never joined the Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court in 1998. It invaded Iraq in 2003 without United Nations Security Council authorisation in an apparent breach of the UN Charter. And it has been providing unconditional support to Israel despite the US ally\u2019s well-documented abuses against Palestinians.\u201cThe United States has done a lot to stand up sort of multilateral institutions \u2013 the UN and others \u2013 that are based around these ideas,\u201d said Matthew Duss, the executive vice president at the Center for International Policy.\u201cBut the United States has always found ways to violate these norms and laws when it when it serves our purposes,\u201d he added, pointing to former US President Joe Biden\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and President George W Bush\u2019s policies after the 9/11 attacks, which included extraordinary rendition, torture, invasion and prolonged occupation.But for Trump and his administration, there are indications that the global order is not just to be worked around; it needs to go.\u201cThe post-war global order is not just obsolete, it is now a weapon being used against us,\u201d Trump\u2019s Secretary of State Marco Rubio told senators during his confirmation hearing in January.Trump recently told Time Magazine that the US has been \u201cripped off\u201d by \u201calmost every country in the world\u201d.His rhetoric on foreign policy appears to echo his statements about promising to look after \u201cAmerica\u2019s forgotten men and women\u201d who have been mistreated by the \u201celites\u201d domestically.While the modern world order has empowered US companies and left the country with immense wealth and military and diplomatic might, Americans do have major issues to complain about.Globalisation saw the outsourcing of US jobs to countries with less expensive labour. Past interventionist policies \u2013 particularly the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2013 are largely seen as strategic blunders that produced a generation of veterans with physical and mental injuries.Geoffrey Kabaservice, vice president of political studies at the Niskanen Center, a centre-right think tank in Washington, DC, noted that wages have stagnated for many Americans for decades.\u201cThe fact is that the benefits of globalisation were very maldistributed, and some people up at the top made enormous plutocratic sums of money, and very little of that flowed down to the mass of the working class,\u201d Kabaservice told Al Jazeera.For people who saw their factories closed and felt like they were living in \u201cleft-behind areas\u201d, electing Trump was \u201cretribution\u201d against the system, Kabaservice said, adding that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach has pitted the US against the rest of the world.\u201cAmerica is turning its back on the world,\u201d Kabaservice said. \u201cTrump believes that America can be self-sufficient in all things, but already the falsity of this doctrine is proving true.\u201dTrita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, a think tank that promotes diplomacy, said Trump\u2019s foreign policy, including his approach to allies, comes from \u201cthe politics of grievance\u201d.\u201cHe does believe that the United States \u2013 because of its role as world policeman, which he\u2019s not necessarily in love with \u2013 has been shouldering a lot of the security burden of the world without getting proper compensation,\u201d Parsi told Al Jazeera.The US president has been calling on NATO allies to increase their defence spending, while suggesting that Washington should be paid more for stationing troops in allied countries like Germany and South Korea.So how does Trump view the world?\u201cHe\u2019s an aggressive unilateralist, and in many ways, he\u2019s just an old-school imperialist,\u201d Duss said of Trump. \u201cHe wants to expand American territory. He wants to extract wealth from other parts of the world \u2026 This is a kind of foreign policy approach from an earlier era.\u201dHe noted that Trump\u2019s foreign policy is to act aggressively and unilaterally to achieve what he sees as US interests.Kabaservice said Trump wants the US to return to an age when it was a manufacturing powerhouse and not too involved in the affairs of the world.\u201cHe likes the idea that maybe the United States is a great power, sort of in a 19th-century model, and it lets the other great powers have their own sphere of influence,\u201d he said.Kabaservice added that Trump wants the US to have \u201cits own sphere of influence\u201d and to be \u201cexpanding in the way that optimistic forward-moving powers are\u201d.This notion of an America with its own \u201csphere of influence\u201d appeared to be supported by Rubio when he spoke earlier this year of the inevitability of \u201cmultipolar world, multi-great powers in different parts of the planet\u201d.Parsi said that Trump is seeking hemispheric hegemony above all, despite his aversion for regime change \u2013 hence his emphasis on acquiring Greenland and the Panama Canal.\u201cYou\u2019re shifting not from the politics of domination towards restraint; you\u2019re shifting from the politics of global domination to a more limited form of domination,\u201d Parsi told Al Jazeera.\u201cFocus only on your own hemisphere.\u201dThe US may have already experienced what happens when these views of nostalgia and grievance see real-world implications. Trump\u2019s erratic trade policy rocked the US stock market and sparked threats of counter-levies from Canada to the European Union to China.Eventually, Trump postponed many of his tariffs, keeping a baseline of 10 percent levies and additional importing fees on Chinese goods. Asked why he suspended the measures, the US president acknowledged that it was due to how the tariffs were received. \u201cPeople were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy,\u201d he said.Ultimately, Trump\u2019s unilateralism and unpredictability have \u201cbroken the world\u2019s trust in significant ways\u201d that will outlast his presidency, Kabaservice told Al Jazeera.\u201cIn the broad span of history, Trump will be seen as the person who committed terrible unforced errors that led to the end of the American century and the beginning of the Chinese century,\u201d he said.During his inauguration speech earlier this year, the US president said his legacy \u201cwill be that of a peacemaker and unifier\u201d.\u201cHis actual legacy will be that he has torn down the global system that the US created,\u201d said Burrows, of the Stimson Center."}

They were wearing highly reflective uniforms and were inside clearly identifiable rescue vehicles before they were shot by Israeli forces.Amid the international outcry, the Israeli military announced it would investigate what happened.It said last week that its probe had identified a series of \u201cprofessional failures\u201d. The army said its code of ethics was not violated and one soldier was dismissed.The PRCS slammed the Israeli military\u2019s findings and called for an independent and impartial investigation by a UN body.Al-Nassasra, 47, is one of two people who survived the attack.The other survivor, Munther Abed, said at the time that he had seen al-Nassasra being captured, bound and taken away.The father of six last spoke to his family on the night of the Israeli attack when he disappeared, telling them he was on his way to the PRCS headquarters to break his Ramadan fast with his colleagues, according to his son Mohamed.When the family tried to call him about dawn the next day, he didn\u2019t respond, and they found out from the PRCS that nobody could reach him or the other emergency workers.Al-Nassasra had always warned his family that whenever he headed out on a mission, he may not make it back, his son said. But the family tried not to think about that as al-Nassasra continued his work throughout Israel\u2019s 18-month war on Gaza.His colleague Ibrahim Abu al-Kass also told Al Jazeera that al-Nassasra always carried sweets to offer children to encourage them to play somewhere safe, not in the middle of the road.Israel has carried out an intensified campaign of arrests during the war. According to the Palestinian prisoner support network Addameer, at least 9,900 Palestinians are currently being held in Israeli detention facilities, including 400 children.More than 3,400 are held without charge or trial under what\u2019s known as \u201cadministrative detention\u201d, which can be renewed for six-month periods indefinitely.Al-Nassasra was released into Gaza through the Kissufim checkpoint along with the 10 other detainees before they were sent to a hospital in central Gaza\u2019s Deir el-Balah for medical checkups.Reporting from the city, Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum said the released detainees reported being tortured in \u201chorrific ways\u201d and were in a bad physical and psychological state.Israeli forces have routinely targeted first responders, humanitarian workers and journalists during the Gaza bombardment.More than 52,300 Palestinians have been killed since the war began on October 7, 2023, while at least 117,905 have been wounded, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health."}

Red lines don\u2019t turn green overnight.\u201dAmnesty also expressed concern about alleged human rights violations committed by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine and attacks on gender equality in Afghanistan and Iran.\u201cThe Taliban government criminalized the public existence of women and girls, passing so-called vice and virtue laws, denying their rights to work and education. Dozens of women protesters were forcibly disappeared or arbitrarily detained,\u201d Callamard said.\u201cIn Iran, new compulsory veiling laws intensified oppression of women and girls, imposing flogging, exorbitant fines and harsh prison sentences, while officials and vigilantes who violently attack women and girls for defying the law continued with impunity.\u201d"}

It was followed two weeks later by the collapse of a two-month ceasefire.\u201cThese are the facts. Starvation is here. Humanitarian aid is being used as a weapon of war,\u201d Hijazi said.The ICJ has been tasked by the UN with providing an advisory opinion \u201con a priority basis and with the utmost urgency\u201d.While no immediate ruling is expected, the court\u2019s advisory opinion will likely shape future international legal approaches.However, it is nonbinding, meaning its impact depends on whether states choose to enforce or ignore it.The ruling \u201cwill likely be ignored by Israel, as it has done with other judgements from the ICJ, the International Criminal Court and other international legal bodies,\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s Rory Challands said, reporting from The Hague.However, he added that \u201cthe tide of pressure is mounting\u201d on Israel as a growing list of international courts have ruled against its actions.What the UN is saying, Challands noted, is that \u201cIsrael basically has a twofold obligation here under international law. It has an obligation as an occupying power in the Palestinian territories \u2026 That includes children\u2019s education and welfare systems, medical facilities, including UN-established hospitals, and humanitarian relief operations. If it doesn\u2019t do those things, then it\u2019s in contravention of its obligations under international law.\u201d\u201cIt also has an obligation as a signatory to the UN Charter, because under that, the UN has immunities and exemptions that set it apart from other institutions and other multilateral organisations\u201d, Challands continued.The ICJ will consider the positions of both state actors and international organisations in its deliberations.However, it will not hear from Israeli representatives directly. Rather, Tel Aviv has submitted written advice and objections.Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar responded to the opening of the hearings by branding them \u201cpart of a systematic persecution and delegitimisation of Israel\u201d in comments to reporters in Jerusalem.\u201cIt is not Israel that should be on trial. It is the UN and UNRWA,\u201d he insisted, referring to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, which Israel is preventing from delivering aid to Gaza."}

That\u2019s the key point of the entire negotiations,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed, who also serves as foreign minister, said during a joint news conference.Media reports said David Barnea, director of Israel\u2019s Mossad spy agency, travelled to Doha on Thursday to meet Mohammed amid efforts to reach a new ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.The Qatari prime minister did not say which elements of the ceasefire talks had progressed in recent days but said Hamas and Israel remained at odds over the ultimate goal of negotiations.Mediator Qatar has been trying to resuscitate a truce after a previous deal collapsed when Israel pulled out of it and resumed its military operations on March 18, nearly two weeks after imposing a total siege on Gaza.For his part, Turkiye\u2019s Fidan said the \u201cethnic cleansing being practised\u201d by Israel in Gaza is against international and humanitarian law.\u201cHumanitarian aid hasn\u2019t reached Gaza in two months now.

Those that aren\u2019t being killed with bombs and bullets are slowly dying,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no justification for the denial of humanitarian assistance. And humanitarian aid should never be weaponised.\u201dAmid warnings of famine in Gaza, Israel continued its air attacks across the Palestinian territory on Sunday, killing at least 50 people, including children.At least 52,243 Palestinians have been confirmed killed and 117,639 wounded in Israel\u2019s war on Gaza since it began 18 months ago, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza.  An estimated 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks and more than 200 were taken captive.Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, described Israel\u2019s aerial and ground attacks as \u201cdevastating\u201d.\u201cIt seems that Israel and Hamas are still locked in a prolonged war of attrition, and the Israeli air strikes continue to overwhelm heavily built-up neighbourhoods,\u201d he said."}

He was imprisoned by Israel as a teenager, spending 10 years behind bars, from 1978 to 1988.During his imprisonment, he learned Hebrew, a skill that would place him in a good position to negotiate with Israel later on.When he was released, he remained with Fatah and climbed the ranks.He is the father of four daughters and two sons.In the event of Abbas\u2019s death or resignation, the deputy chair would be expected to become the acting head of the PLO and of the State of Palestine, which is recognised by nearly 150 countries.Concerns have been growing within the PLO that Israel might exploit Abbas\u2019s departure and a possible power vacuum.Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim gave al-Sheikh\u2019s appointment a frosty reception.\u201cThe Palestinian people are not a herd to have imposed upon them leaders with dubious history who have tied their present and future to the occupation,\u201d he said in a statement.\u201cLegitimacy is held only by the Palestinian people\u2026 The guardianship over our people is long gone.\u201dThe PLO is an umbrella organisation comprising several Palestinian political factions. But it excludes Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, which are currently fighting Israeli forces in Gaza and are at odds with Abbas.Founded in 1964, the PLO is empowered to negotiate and sign international treaties on behalf of the Palestinian people, while the PA is responsible for governing parts of the Palestinian territory, particularly the occupied West Bank."}

For many Palestinians in Gaza, community kitchens were their only source of nutrition after Israeli forces destroyed almost all food production facilities.WFP has appealed to the international community to put pressure on Israel to lift the blockade, saying more than 116,000 metric tonnes of food assistance \u2013 enough to feed one million people for up to four months \u2013 are already positioned for delivery \u201cas soon as borders reopen\u201d.Reporting from Deir el-Balah on Saturday, Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum said the humanitarian crisis in the besieged territory \u201chas reached a very unprecedented breaking point\u201d.\u201cCivilians are really struggling to cope with this crisis,\u201d he said.Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, said the crisis was \u201cman-made\u201d.Michael Fakhri, UN rapporteur on the right to food, said Israel is \u201cexecuting this starvation campaign with no repercussions\u201d.The World Health Organization said the situation was no different for medical supplies, with WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus pleading on X for the aid blockade to end.At least 2,062 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel resumed its deadly campaign against Hamas on March 18, and more than 50,000 since October 7, 2023.

They\u2019re already rationing supplies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the organisations, it\u2019s also families running out of supplies.\u201dIt\u2019s \u201chard to imagine\u201d how hundreds of thousands of families who have relied on daily meals provided by the WFP are \u201cgoing to get by\u201d, he added.Gaza\u2019s Government Media Office has warned the dwindling food supplies could push \u201cthousands of Palestinian families\u201d into starvation.It reported that 52 people, including 50 children, have already died due to hunger and malnutrition, while more than one million children go hungry every day.Despite the humanitarian crisis, Israel has shown no signs of reversing the blockade. Last week, Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israel would keep blocking aid, describing it as a tactic to \u201cpressure\u201d Hamas.Israel\u2019s military has repeatedly accused Hamas of exploiting aid \u2013 a claim the group denies \u2013 and argues it must keep all supplies out to prevent the fighters from getting it.However, even some of Israel\u2019s closest allies have publicly condemned the strategy. On Wednesday, Germany, France and the United Kingdom collectively called the action \u201cintolerable\u201d and warned that it is increasing the risk of \u201cstarvation, epidemic disease and death\u201d.As the food crisis deepened, Israeli attacks continued across the war-battered enclave. At least 78 people were killed in the past 24 hours, Gaza\u2019s Government Media Office said Friday. This included 15 victims of air raids on homes in Khan Younis, and a woman killed by a quadcopter attack near Jabalia refugee camp, according to local media reports.Meanwhile, efforts continued to revive stalled ceasefire talks in Cairo, where a Hamas delegation was expected to meet with Egyptian officials on Saturday.Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told AFP that the group\u2019s delegation in Cairo would be headed by Khalil al-Hayya. He reiterated that Hamas\u2019s weapons \u201care not up for negotiation\u201d.So far, the truce effort has been deadlocked, with Hamas insisting on a permanent ceasefire and Israel offering only temporary truces and demanding that Hamas disarm.But mediators have begun work on a proposal that would include a five-to-seven-year truce following the release of all captives in Gaza and an end to fighting, Reuters reported, quoting several informed sources.Since the ceasefire collapsed on March 18, Israeli attacks have killed more than 1,900 Palestinians, many of them civilians, according to health authorities in Gaza, and hundreds of thousands have been displaced as Israel seized what it calls a buffer zone.At least 51,439 people have been killed and 117,416 wounded in Israel\u2019s war on Gaza since it began in October 2023, according to Palestinian authorities."}

Yet it remains unclear who will eventually fill the post.The aim is to prevent a power struggle after Abbas vacates his post \u2013 a scenario that Israel could exploit to cause the collapse of the PA, fully annexe the occupied West Bank and ethnically cleanse Gaza, experts told Al Jazeera.Yet Dianna Buttu, a former legal adviser to the PLO, believes creating a vice president post in the PA will not avert a power struggle once Abbas is gone \u2013 rather, it could exacerbate conflict.\u201cThe more fragmented the PA becomes, the more it will create a power vacuum \u2026 and that vacuum will be filled by external actors and mainly by the Americans and Israelis,\u201d she warned.Abbas, 89, assumed control of the PLO and PA after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat died in November 2004 and has ruled without a popular mandate since dissolving parliament in 2007.His Fatah party dominates the PA and PLO. The long-defunct parliament has faded away, and critics have slammed Abbas for seeming to undermine attempts to hold elections that could revive it.In the absence of parliament, the PLO controls the succession, a task Abbas has postponed, including by decreeing last year that Rawhi Fattouh, head of the Palestinian National Council, would become interim president if the position became vacant suddenly until elections are held.\u201cAbbas has put this off out of fear that if he brought anyone forward, then they would be a rival,\u201d said Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Contemporary Arab Studies.The PA was created by the Oslo Peace Accords, signed by Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1993 and 1995.Tasked with governing the West Bank and Gaza until a Palestinian state was created alongside Israel, the PA lost credibility among Palestinians as Israel\u2019s occupation became more violent and oppressive, and land grabs for Israeli settlements continued.Since Oslo, the population of settlements, illegal under international law, built on Palestinian land has risen from about 200,000 to more than 750,000.In 2007, a violent split with Hamas in Gaza constrained the PA\u2019s authority to the parts of the occupied West Bank that it had some limited control over.The PA did manage to become the de facto Palestinian representative on the international stage, replacing the PLO.But at home, Abbas\u2019s popularity slipped as people\u2019s suffering increased and the PA continued its security coordination with Israel, which was outlined in the Oslo Accords.The PA is also seen to have failed to protect Palestinians from Israeli troops and settlers while using its authority to crack down on civil activists and opponents.This has resulted in a situation in which whoever he appoints, \u201cAbbas\u2019s handpicked successor probably won\u2019t win people over\u201d, Elgindy told Al Jazeera.The name suggested most often is Abbas\u2019s close confidant and secretary-general of the PLO Executive Committee, Hussein al-Sheikh.Al-Sheikh also heads the PA\u2019s General Authority for Civil Affairs, which issues the Israeli-approved permits that enable a few Palestinians to navigate the movement restrictions Israel has implemented in the occupied West Bank.Human rights groups and the International Court of Justice \u2013 the highest legal body in the world \u2013 see Israel\u2019s movement restrictions against Palestinians as apartheid.Sheikh\u2019s long-standing relationship with the Israeli authorities has led critics to accuse him of acting as a liaison for the occupation.\u201cNobody likes him [among Palestinians],\u201d said Omar Rahman, an expert on Israel-Palestine with the Middle East Council for Global Affairs. \u201c[Al-Sheikh] is tainted by his relationship to Israel and perceptions [that he is embroiled in] massive corruption.\u201dThe pressure on Abbas regarding succession has ebbed and flowed over the years, intensifying over recent months as Arab states push him to appoint a successor to prevent the PA from dissolving into chaos, analysts told Al Jazeera.Egypt is particularly eager to ensure succession, according to Rahman.In March, Egypt called and hosted an Arab League summit, during which it unveiled its reconstruction plan for Gaza to counter United States President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to ethnically cleanse Gaza and turn it into a \u201cMiddle East Riviera\u201d.Egypt was mentioned as one of the countries where Palestinians could be \u201cmoved to\u201d, an idea it firmly rejected and countered with its reconstruction plan.The proposal included creating a Palestinian technocratic administration, supervised by the PA, to oversee the reconstruction of the devastated enclave without displacing anyone.The path to PA administration of Gaza is not at all clear, however, as both Hamas and Israel object to it \u2013 Hamas because it administers Gaza currently, while Israel has panned the PA as ineffective.Abbas appears to have gone on the offensive, delivering angry broadsides against Hamas during the meetings and blaming the group for allowing the continuation of Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza by not handing over captives and disarming.However, many Arab states blame Abbas for failing to reconcile his Fatah faction with Hamas, making them eager to see a change of guard in the PA, according to Tahani Mustafa, an expert on Palestinian internal politics with the International Crisis GroupSince 2007, Fatah and Hamas have signed several agreements to heal their divisions after the fighting that split the Palestinian national movement.\u201cI think there has been a lot of frustration [among Arab states] that [Abbas] has been more of a spoiler and obstacle to trying to get a united Palestinian front, which has given Israel a pretext to continue doing what it has been doing in Gaza,\u201d Mustafa told Al Jazeera.Instead of creating a new political post, Buttu believes Abbas should hold elections for Fatah, the PLO and the PA.The last time voting was held was just before the conflict between Hamas and Fatah in 2006. Hamas won a huge majority in those legislative elections.The choice to create a new vice president post, she fears, won\u2019t solve the legitimacy crisis or power vacuum once Abbas is gone, given what she described as Abbas\u2019s lack of political will to revive Palestinian institutions.\u201cIn typical fashion, Abbas is doing the bare minimum to get [Arab states] off his back,\u201d she told Al Jazeera.Elections, she acknowledged, could prove technically difficult due to Israel\u2019s devastating war and genocide in Gaza as well as its violence and movement restrictions in the West Bank.However, she said Palestinians could still find ways to vote, perhaps through an online portal or process.\u201cInside Fatah itself, there is a lot of pushback on this appointment of a vice president. They are all saying there should be elections instead,\u201d Buttu told Al Jazeera.\u201c[Abbas] is putting a Band-Aid on a wound so open that it requires surgery,\u201d she said."}

While lasting just a few hours, the scene was similar to encampment protests that swept across US universities last year, often prompting crackdowns and policy changes from administrators.The next day, Yale said in a statement that the encampment had violated its policies related to the use of outdoor spaces and students who had been warned or punished in previous incidents would face \u201cimmediate disciplinary action\u201d.It added that the university was investigating \u201cconcerns \u2026 about disturbing anti-Semitic conduct at the gathering\u201d without providing any details.The administration also said the student organisation Yalies4Palestine would lose its official status for sending \u201cout calls over social media for others to join the event\u201d and for later taking credit for the event.In a statement to the student newspaper, the Yale Daily News, a group of pro-Palestine protesters denied the event was affiliated with or planned by any group.The protests then continued on Wednesday night when Ben-Gvir arrived for a speech at the Shabtai, a private Jewish society that describes itself as \u201cbased at Yale University\u201d although it is not formally affiliated with or located at a property owned by the university.Ben-Gvir briefly taunted the protesters with what his office told CNN was a \u201cvictory sign\u201d gesture as he was met with chants of \u201cshame on you\u201d, according to video of the event.His office later said a water bottle had been thrown at him from the crowd, which included students and nonstudents, and he was unharmed.Yale\u2019s latest punishment for pro-Palestine protesters comes during a wider pressure campaign on top universities by the administration of President Donald Trump.While former President Joe Biden was seen as endorsing crackdowns on pro-Palestine protests, which he broadly described in April last year as \u201canti-Semitic\u201d, the Trump administration has escalated the response.Using claims of \u201canti-Semitism\u201d, the Trump administration has sought to deport noncitizen pro-Palestine university protesters and has frozen or threatened to freeze federal funding for several top institutions, including Columbia University in New York and Harvard University in Massachusetts, if they do not agree to a series of policy changes.Throughout the protest movement, organisers have repeatedly challenged the notion that such demonstrations are anti-Semitic, noting the regular involvement of Jewish students and disavowing rare instances of anti-Jewish statements made at often publicly open demonstrations.In their statement carried by the student newspaper, pro-Palestine protesters at Yale accused administrators of coming down particularly harshly to avoid recourse from the Trump administration.\u201cAttacking students and alienating community members didn\u2019t save Harvard or Columbia. It won\u2019t save Yale,\u201d they said.Yale did not reply to Al Jazeera\u2019s request for comment on whether concerns about a Trump administration response informed its disciplinary actions or if it had any response to Ben-Gvir\u2019s visit.For her part, Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general of the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division, responded to a video on X showing protesters refusing to break a human chain to allow a student to pass through their ranks on campus.The post claimed: \u201cJewish students aren\u2019t allowed to walk through Yale\u2019s campus anymore!\u201dDhillon wrote that her office is \u201ctracking the concerning activities at Yale, and is in touch with affected students\u201d. While critics said heavy-handed responses to pro-Palestine protesters have become commonplace in the US, some observers said the dissonance on display at Yale has been particularly striking.Ben-Gvir was convicted in 2008 by an Israeli court of inciting racism and supporting a \u201cterrorist\u201d organisation, the founded Kach group, which supported the annexation and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian territories.He has called for a no-holds-barred military operation in Gaza, where UN experts already say Israel is committing \u201cgenocidal acts\u201d.He has appealed for Israel to commit what would constitute war crimes under international law in Gaza. Most recently, he posted on X that he told \u201csenior Republican officials\u201d at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida that Israel should bomb \u201cfood and aid depots\u201d.Eman Abdelhadi, a sociologist at the University of Chicago, said Yale\u2019s silence regarding Ben-Gvir speaking at an organisation that claims to be based at the university \u201cexposes the deepest contradictions in our society and in these institutions that are supposed to be dedicated towards truth seeking and critical thought\u201d.\u201c[Ben-Gvir] faces no red line,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the people protesting can face severe consequences.\u201d\u201cThis is a moment where universities are fighting for their lives and trying to argue to the American public that they are worth saving in the face of Trump\u2019s onslaught,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet they show no moral courage.\u201d"}

They are all severed and torn,\u201d Arar told Al Jazeera.Another 10 people were killed and several others wounded in a strike on a former police station in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza, according to a statement from the Indonesian Hospital, where the casualties were taken.\u201cEveryone started running and screaming, not knowing what to do from the horror and severity of the bombing,\u201d 23-year-old Abdel Qader Sabah, from Jabalia, said of the attack that hit the station that is located near a market.Israel\u2019s military said it struck what it described as a Hamas \u201ccommand and control centre\u201d in the Jabalia area, without clarifying if it was targeting the police station. The army has previously used similar justifications in attacks that hit hospitals and numerous shelters housing displaced Palestinian families.At least 26 people were killed in other Israeli attacks across the territory, according to medics and the civil defence agency.Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said there is \u201can ongoing surge in the rate of Israeli attacks on the entire Gaza Strip\u201d.He said that civil defence crews are still working to dig through the rubble at the scene of the latest attack in Jabalia.He cited one rescue worker as saying many of the victims have sustained burn wounds.Israel resumed its military assault on the Gaza Strip on March 18, ending a two-month ceasefire that had brought a temporary halt to fighting in the blockaded territory.The military is continuing to seal vital border crossings for the eighth week in a row, denying the entry of much-needed humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and fuel, worsening an already deep humanitarian crisis amid relentless bombardment.Israel\u2019s army chief, visiting troops in Gaza on Thursday, threatened a \u201clarger\u201d offensive if captives seized in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, are not freed.\u201cIf we do not see progress in the return of the hostages in the near future, we will expand our activities to a larger and more significant operation,\u201d Eyal Zamir said.The Israeli military, meanwhile, ordered Palestinians living in the northern areas of Beit Hanoon and Sheikh Zeid to evacuate in advance of an attack.The United Nations has warned that Israel\u2019s expanding evacuation orders across Gaza are resulting in the \u201cforcible transfer\u201d of people into ever-shrinking areas.Aid agencies estimate that the vast majority of Gaza\u2019s 2.4 million residents have been displaced at least once since the war began. Also on Thursday, the Gaza Health Ministry said the Durra Children\u2019s Hospital in Gaza City had become nonoperational, a day after an Israeli strike hit the upper part of the building, damaging the intensive care unit and destroying the facility\u2019s solar power panel system.Gaza\u2019s health system has been devastated by Israel\u2019s 18-month-old military campaign, putting many of the territory\u2019s hospitals out of action, killing medics, and reducing crucial supplies.Efforts by key mediators Qatar and Egypt, backed by the United States, have so far failed to produce a lasting ceasefire.Since Israel resumed its assault, at least 1,978 people have been killed in Gaza, raising the overall death toll to at least 51,355 since October 2023, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.The military said Thursday that Israeli tank fire killed a UN worker in the central Gaza city of Deir el-Balah last month, according to an investigation\u2019s initial findings.It had initially denied operating in the area where a Bulgarian employee of the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) was killed on March 19.The findings come after the military on Sunday reported on a separate probe into the killing of 15 Palestinian emergency workers in Gaza.It finally admitted that operational failures led to their deaths, and said a field commander would be dismissed."}

In February 2024, it said it also would not buy weapons from Israel. However, in the same month, the Spanish Ministry of Interior signed a deal with IMI Solutions to purchase 15 million rounds of ammunition. The ammunition was destined for the Civil Guard, Spain\u2019s semi-military police force.However, after protests from five ministers from Sumar, the Spanish government began a study to determine whether it was feasible to cancel the order.\u201cIn October 2024, a study was started into the possible ending of the contract. After the study, the ministry decided to follow the recommendation from the state attorney, who advised against the ending of the contract at that stage, so the contract was honoured,\u201d a spokesperson for the Spanish Interior Ministry told Al Jazeera, adding that ending \u201cthe contract would have involved paying \u2026 [IMI Solutions] without receiving the material.\u201dOn Wednesday, April 23, the Interior Ministry said it would go ahead with the arms deal, six months after seeking to cancelling it, to avoid paying compensation to the Israeli company.In response, Yolanda D\u00edaz, deputy prime minister and leader of Sumar, told reporters in Barcelona, \u201cThis deal must be rectified. I insist, it is a flagrant violation of the agreements when we are witnessing the live genocide of the Palestinian people.\u201dAnalysts said the row could further damage already tense relations between the Socialists and Sumar in Spain\u2019s fragile government, especially after Sanchez announced on Tuesday that his government would raise defence spending to 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to hit NATO targets, a move which angered Sumar. Under pressure from US President Donald Trump, Spain, which has the lowest NATO budget among its 32 members, rolled out a 10.5-billion-euro ($12bn) plan to meet the 2-percent goal this year.Spaniards were divided over the ammunition deal, with a poll for online newspaper 20minutos.es showing that 48.46 percent of the 7,871 people surveyed opposed it, while 46.94 percent backed the deal and 4.58 percent did not know how they felt.\u201cBuying this ammunition would have shown that Spain is not supporting Palestine. It would have been a betrayal of the [more than] 50,000 people who have died in Gaza in the genocide there,\u201d Igor Otxoa, of the Guernica Palestine organisation, a civic organisation, told Al Jazeera.In the wake of the dispute, Veronica Martinez Barbero, Sumar\u2019s parliamentary spokesperson, told Al Jazeera Spain should not go ahead with the contract.\u201cThere is a question of not completing promises. The defence minister said Spain would not buy these weapons. We want this to be rectified, and this contract not be completed,\u201d she said.But not everybody has supported the decision to cancel the contract. Astrid Barrio Lopez, a political analyst at the University of Valencia, told Al Jazeera the decision \u201cshows that there is little judicial security for companies dealing with the Spanish government and little leadership within the government\u201d.The Israeli embassy in Madrid could not be reached for comment.Late Thursday, Israel criticised Spain\u2019s decision to halt the ammunition deal and accused it of \u201csacrificing security considerations for political purposes\u201d.\u201cIsrael strongly condemns the decision by the Spanish government to unilaterally breach a contract signed with the defense company IMI Systems, and its announcement that it will refrain from future defense deals with Israeli companies,\u201d said Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry in a statement to the AFP news agency.It added, Spain \u201ccontinues to stand on the wrong side of history \u2013 against the Jewish state that is defending itself from terrorist attacks\u201d."}

The Houthis reported US strikes on the Hodeidah, Marib and Saada governorates.In Marib, the Houthis described a strike hitting telecommunications equipment, which had previously been a US target.The Houthis, in response, have stepped up their targeting of US drones flying over the country. Houthi military spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Saree said late on Tuesday that the rebels had shot down an MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemen\u2019s northwest Hajjah governorate.MQ-9 Reaper drones, which cost about $30m apiece, can fly at altitudes of more than 40,000 feet (12,100 metres) and remain in the air for more than 30 hours.The US military and CIA have flown them for years over Afghanistan, Iraq, and now Yemen.The Houthis claim to have downed 26 MQ-9s over the past decade of the Yemen war.The US military acknowledged the report of the drone being downed but said it could not comment further.The US military says it is targeting Houthi \u201cterrorists\u201d to stop attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea, a crucial global trade route, and Israel."}

Anton and the more than two million Palestinians in Gaza have often felt abandoned in the 18 months of conflict, in which more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, with hope of an end to the war still feeling remote.But the late pope, who died aged 88 in the Vatican City on Monday after a battle with illness, was in constant contact with Gaza\u2019s small Christian community. Before his illness, he held calls every evening with those sheltering at the church, and continued to reach out, on a less regular basis, even after he fell ill.Kamal remembered his most recent call on Saturday, just two days before his death. Pope Francis was greeting the members of the church for Easter.\u201cDuring his call, he prayed for peace and resilience for us in Gaza,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cHe never forgot the word \u2018peace\u2019 in any of his calls with us throughout the war. His support included all of us \u2013 Christians and Muslims alike. He prayed daily for our safety.\u201dA deep sense of grief and sorrow permeates the Holy Family Church, where approximately 550 displaced Palestinian Christians continue to seek shelter.Israel has attacked the church and its neighbouring school several times during the war, including a July 2024 attack in which four people were killed. Another church, St Porphyrios Greek Orthodox Church, has also been bombed.But the Holy Family Church is still a refuge. People gather inside the church every day, piano music accompanies hymns during prayer, and people greet Father Gabriel Romanelli. He\u2019s the parish priest, an Argentinian who came to Gaza to lead the church 15 years ago.After the death of the pope, those in the church have largely dressed in black, the colour of mourning.The loss of the leader of their church was a solemn enough event, but Palestinian Christians know they have also lost one of their greatest defenders \u2013 a world leader who has long backed the Palestinian cause, and has earned the anger of Israel on a number of occasions for his defence of Palestinians.In his final public speech delivered on his behalf on Easter, Francis called for peace in Gaza and urged the warring sides to \u201cagree to a ceasefire, release the hostages, and provide aid to a starving people longing for a peaceful future\u201d.Father Romanelli told Al Jazeera that the loss of Pope Francis was a tragedy for Christians around the world, and particularly in Gaza.He recalled that Saturday phone call with the pope.\u201cHe said he was praying for us, supporting us, and thanked us for our prayers,\u201d Romanelli said. \u201cPeople at the church waited for his call daily. He would speak to the children and reassure them. He was deeply human and incredibly supportive, especially during the war.\u201dKamal noted that support from Pope Francis was also material, in the form of aid arriving in Gaza until Israel blocked all entry of goods into Gaza in March, just before it unilaterally broke a ceasefire.\u201cEveryone in Gaza knows how much the Vatican supported us,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cWe always shared that aid with our Muslim neighbours too.\u201dKamal\u2019s fellow Palestinian Christian, 74-year-old Maher Terzi, is also in mourning.Maher, who has been displaced since the first week of the war, had just sat in the mourning hall when he spoke to Al Jazeera.\u201cHe gave us strength,\u201d Maher said. \u201cHe told us not to be afraid, that he was with us and would never abandon us, no matter what.\u201d\u201cHe encouraged us to hold on to our land, and promised to help us rebuild our destroyed homes,\u201d Maher added. \u201cHis death is a catastrophe and a shock for us during such a difficult time.\u201d"}

One body had been found a few days before.The army said it had \u201cshrouded\u201d the bodies with cloth and sand to protect them until humanitarian organisations could retrieve them.Israel had blocked access to the site for days, later insisting it was not an attempt to cover up the attack.Here\u2019s what to know about the attack, Israel\u2019s claims and how the investigation stacks up against other evidence:A video found on the phone of slain paramedic Rifaat Radwan shows the team\u2019s final moments.The video, filmed from inside one of the last two ambulances to head out, shows a firetruck and ambulances driving ahead through the night.All vehicles were clearly identified with emergency lights flashing.The vehicles stopped when they see an ambulance and bodies by the roadside, and first responders in reflective uniforms exit the vehicles. Moments later, intense gunfire erupts.As the gunfire continues, Radwan can be heard asking his mother for forgiveness and reciting the Islamic declaration of faith, the Shahada, before he dies.After a review, the Israeli military described the killings as \u201cprofessional failures\u201d and a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d. Nobody has been charged.It dismissed a deputy commander for \u201cproviding an incomplete report\u201d and reprimanded a commanding officer.Major General Yoav Har-Even, who conducted the review, said two responders were killed in an initial incident, 12 people were killed in a second shooting and another person was killed in a third incident.\u201cThe fire in the first two incidents resulted from an operational misunderstanding by the troops, who believed they faced a tangible threat from enemy forces. The third incident involved a breach of orders during a combat setting,\u201d the military statement said.Troops bulldozed over the bodies and their mangled vehicles, but the investigation said that was not an attempt to conceal the attack.The Military Advocate General\u2019s Corps, meant to be an independent body under Israel\u2019s attorney general and Supreme Court, can now decide whether to file civil charges.The investigative report said soldiers did not recognise the ambulances due to \u201cpoor night visibility\u201d and because flashing lights are less visible on night-vision drones and goggles.It also blamed the now-dismissed deputy commander, saying he mistakenly thought the ambulance was being used by Hamas and opened fire first.Israel has tried to justify previous attacks on protected entities by saying Hamas hides among civilians and uses ambulances to carry out operations.Har-Even told reporters that one of the humanitarian workers at the scene was questioned over suspected Hamas links. The man, Munther Abed, was released the next day.Before the video of the attack was found, Israel\u2019s military had said the ambulances had been \u201cadvancing suspiciously\u201d towards its soldiers \u201cwithout headlights or emergency signals\u201d.The first responders were \u201cin their uniforms, still wearing gloves\u201d when they were killed, said Jonathan Whittall, the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the Palestinian territory.Gaza Civil Defence spokesperson Mahmoud Bassal said several team members were found with their hands and feet bound and bullet wounds to the head and torso, indicating they were executed at close range after being identified as humanitarian workers.Without offering proof, the Israeli investigative report said six of those killed were \u201cHamas members\u201d although no Palestinian fighters were reported found in the mass grave.Har-Even told reporters that no paramedic was armed and no weapons were found in any vehicle.An Israeli military official said the bodies had been covered \u201cin sand and cloth\u201d to preserve them until their retrieval could be coordinated with international organisations.The army also said it has found \u201cno evidence to support claims of execution\u201d and \u201csuch claims are blood libels and false accusations against [Israeli] soldiers\u201d.Human rights groups and international legal experts said Israel\u2019s self-reviews often lack independence and transparency.Israel said it reviews its military\u2019s conduct through internal probes led by its military advocate general, who decides whether to pursue criminal investigations.But the military has a track record of denying wrongdoing, contradicting itself or blaming low-ranking individuals without broader repercussions for the armed forces.In 2022, it claimed Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed by Palestinian fire until several media investigations debunked that. Israel later admitted it may have shot her \u201caccidentally\u201d but ruled out a criminal probe.In January, the International Criminal Court\u2019s top prosecutor defended seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, citing Israel\u2019s failure to genuinely investigate allegations of war crimes.The PRCS and the Israeli rights organisation Breaking the Silence have rejected the findings of the Israeli probe.\u201cIt is incomprehensible why the occupation soldiers buried the bodies of the paramedics,\u201d PRCS President Younis al-Khatib told Al Araby TV.He said evidence such as the video proved \u201cthe falsehood of the occupation\u2019s narrative\u201d, adding that the Israeli army communicated with the paramedics before killing them."}

More innocent lives taken, with no accountability.\u201dBut far-right voices in the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believe the army is going too far in punishing the soldiers.Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel\u2019s ultranationalist national security minister, said the decision to dismiss the deputy commander was a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d that must be reversed.\u201cOur combat soldiers, who are sacrificing their lives in Gaza, deserve our full support,\u201d he said.Human rights lawyer Geoffrey Nice told Al Jazeera that the findings of the probe raise questions about the Israeli military\u2019s conduct in Gaza and the thoroughness of the investigative process.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty surprising document. It\u2019s also a document that invites many questions that it will be difficult, I suspect, for the [Israeli military] to answer,\u201d Nice said in a television interview.\u201cFor example, [there is] the proposition that six of these people were Hamas, presumably members of Hamas on active [military] service, not people who might have been associated with Hamas in some way. No documentary evidence at all is identified [for that].\u201dIsrael has a track record of denying accusations of wrongdoing and contradicting its own earlier statements.Past investigations have exonerated the armed forces or placed the blame on a single individual without broader repercussions.The UN accused the Israeli military of being responsible for the killing of the 15 aid workers, along with the killing of a Bulgarian UN staff member and wounding of six other foreign staff in Gaza\u2019s Deir el-Balah last month.The organisation has been forced to significantly cut its staff in Gaza as the war\u2019s death toll continues to mount."}

But they pledged to resume strikes after Israel renewed its assault on the besieged enclave last month.The Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah or \u201csupporters of God\u201d, emerged in the 1990s but rose to prominence in 2014 when they seized Sanaa and forced President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee the country."}

Israel said it was targeting \u201cterrorists\u201d.That attack killed at least 18 displaced Palestinians who had sought refuge in the church. More than 51,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army since the start of the war.During a brief appearance before thousands of Catholic pilgrims gathered in St Peter\u2019s Square for the Vatican\u2019s open-air Easter Mass, Pope Francis renewed his call for a ceasefire in Gaza.He also called on the Palestinian armed group Hamas and other groups to release the remaining captives held in Gaza.Israeli authorities prevented many Christians, including Palestinians, from accessing holy sites for Easter in the occupied West Bank.Israeli police clashed with Christian worshippers and even a priest as they tried to access the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in occupied East Jerusalem.The Old City of Jerusalem was in effect turned by Israeli authorities into a military outpost, said Fathi Nimer, Palestine policy fellow at the Al-Shabaka think tank.\u201cSome would say that there are now more soldiers, security and police officers than worshippers around the Holy Sepulchre,\u201d he told Al Jazeera from Ramallah in the West Bank on Sunday.\u201cThere are dozens of checkpoints within the city, and these limitations have not only impacted Palestinian Christians from the West Bank but also from Jerusalem itself and within the 1948 territories.\u201dNimer said people were beaten, and Israeli officers and onlookers directed insults and slurs towards Christians.Only about 6,000 Palestinians from the West Bank received permits to attend Easter services this year, and even the representative of the Vatican in Palestine was denied entry into the church.Nimer said a tightening Israeli chokehold over holy places in the past few years has led to a dwindling number of worshippers of Palestinian origin.\u201cThis is all part of the wider war on Palestinian culture and identity. Israel is basically saying they have an exclusive claim to Jerusalem and all of Palestine,\u201d he said.Mitri Raheb, a Palestinian pastor and theologian and founder and president of Dar al-Kalima University in Bethlehem, concurred that current Israeli restrictions are among the toughest.\u201cI myself as a pastor don\u2019t have a permit to go for the Holy Week, which is the most important week for Christians throughout the year because Jesus was crucified and risen in Jerusalem,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\u201cThe Palestinian-Christian community that has been there for 2,000 years cannot go there to celebrate and mark this where it all happened.\u201dRaheb said incitement against Palestinian Christians, especially clergy members, has also been on the rise with dozens of incidents of Israeli settler attacks reported this year.\u201cOne of the first things you read about in church about Jesus is that he was like a lamb led to the slaughter. But when you hear this today as Palestinian Christians, you think it\u2019s our whole people being led to slaughter, considering what is happening in Gaza.\u201dIsraeli settlers and politicians, backed by armed police and soldiers, have also been increasingly storming the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound to perform Talmudic rituals and challenge its status quo.Non-Muslims are not allowed to worship at the compound of Islam\u2019s third holiest site, which is located in East Jerusalem, as part of the status quo agreement that the Israeli government claims it remains committed to.Pope Tawadros II, head of Egypt\u2019s Coptic Orthodox Church, strongly condemned the Israeli onslaught on Gaza.\u201cPalestinians are subject to the most horrific forms of injustice in their daily lives amid the destruction of their homeland,\u201d he told state television during Easter celebrations."}

The pope then wrote a letter to US bishops and said: \u2018No, you need to think about everyone,\u2019\u201d said Bays."}

It said the air strikes are aimed at forcing the Houthis to stop threatening ships sailing on the Red Sea on a route crucial to international trade.Since November 2023, the group has reportedly launched more than 100 attacks on vessels it says are linked to Israel in response to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and in solidarity with Palestinians.On Friday, Houthi official Mohammed Nasser al-Atifi told Al Masirah that the \u201cAmerican enemy\u2019s crimes\u201d will not deter the Yemeni people from supporting Gaza, but \u201crather will strengthen their steadfastness and resilience\u201d.The Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah or \u201csupporters of God\u201d, are an armed group that controls most parts of Yemen, including Sanaa. The group emerged in the 1990s but rose to prominence in 2014 when it seized Sanaa and forced President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee the country.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres \u201cis gravely concerned about the airstrikes conducted by the United States over the course of 17 and 18 April in and around Yemen\u2019s port of Ra\u2019s Isa, which reportedly resulted in scores of civilian casualties, including five humanitarian workers injured,\u201d Guterres spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement on Saturday.Guterres expressed fears of damage to the port and \u201cpossible oil leaks into the Red Sea\u201d, Dujarric added.The strikes on Ras Isa aimed to cut off supplies and funds for the Houthis, the US military said. It was the deadliest attack of Washington\u2019s 15-month campaign against the Iran-aligned group.About 70 percent of Yemen\u2019s imports and 80 percent of its humanitarian assistance pass through the ports of Ras Isa, Hodeidah and as-Salif.Ras Isa also is the terminus of Yemen\u2019s main oil pipeline, which, along with its port, are \u201ccritical and irreplaceable infrastructure\u201d in Yemen, according to the UN Development Programme."}

The official added there was no protest at the time and police were investigating whether the killing was politically motivated or for some other reason.In Lahore, police said they were ramping up security at 27 KFC outlets after two attacks took place and five were prevented.\u201cWe are investigating the role of different individuals and groups in these attacks,\u201d Faisal Kamran, a senior Lahore police officer told the Reuters news agency, adding that 11 people, including a member of the Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), have been arrested in the city. He added the protests were not officially organised by the TLP.TLP spokesman Rehan Mohsin Khan said the group \u201chas urged Muslims to boycott Israeli products, but it has not given any call for protest outside KFC\u201d.\u201cIf any other person claiming to be a TLP leader or activist has indulged in such activity, it should be taken as his personal act which has nothing to do with the party\u2019s policy,\u201d Khan said.Western brands have been hit by boycotts and other forms of protests in Pakistan, other Muslim-majority countries and several Western nations over Israel\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip.In February last year, McDonald\u2019s cited boycott campaigns in the Middle East, Indonesia and Malaysia for sales growing just 0.7 percent during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with 16.5 percent growth in the same quarter the previous year.Unilever \u2013 which produces Dove soap, Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream and Knorr stock cubes \u2013 also said sales in Indonesia in the same quarter had experienced a double-digit decline as a result of \u201cgeopolitically focused, consumer-facing campaigns\u201d.A KFC restaurant in the Pakistan-administered region of Kashmir was also set on fire in March last year as protesters chanted \u201cFree Palestine.\u201dMore than 51,900 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel\u2019s war, which began 18 months ago.At least 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks of October 7, 2023, and more than 200 were taken captive.KFC and its parent company Yum Brands have not yet responded to news of the arrests in Pakistan."}

The armed group has flatly refused the demand and insists a permanent ceasefire must be part of any deal.At least 15 children, hit during an overnight air raid on tents in Khan Younis, were among the casualties, according to the statement.

It is administered by Jordan, but access to the site itself is controlled by Israeli soldiers. It is also considered an important site by Jews, who believe it to be the site of the First and Second Temples, the latter destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.Earlier this week, an Al-generated video depicting the destruction of the mosque and construction of the \u201cThird Temple\u201d under the title \u201cNext Year in Jerusalem\u201d was published on the platforms.In a statement published on X, the ministry said it considers the posts on social media a \u201csystematic incitement to escalate the targeting of Christian and Islamic holy sites in occupied Jerusalem\u201d.\u201cThe Ministry calls on the international community and its relevant UN institutions to deal with this incitement with utmost seriousness, and to take the measures required by international law,\u201d it said.Al-Aqsa has become a regular target of visits by right-wing Israeli politicians and Israeli settlers, who have stormed the compound on an almost weekly basis and performed religious rituals under the protection of Israeli forces.Under the decades-old status quo maintained by Israeli authorities, Jews and other non-Muslims are allowed to visit the compound in occupied East Jerusalem during specified hours, but they are not permitted to pray there or display religious symbols.Last August, right-wing Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir caused outrage by saying he would build a Jewish synagogue at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to the Jews as the Temple Mount.Once considered a fringe movement, the campaign to build a \u201cThird Temple\u201d on Al-Aqsa is growing in Israel, and many Palestinians see parallels with what has happened in Hebron, where the Ibrahimi Mosque, also known as the Cave of the Patriarchs, was partitioned.Since taking office in December 2022, Ben-Gvir, as national security minister, has visited the holy site at least six times, drawing severe condemnation."}

Supporters say she was targeted over an op-ed she co-authored last year, criticising Tufts University for dismissing a student government resolution that called on the school to divest from Israeli companies.For these claims to be assessed, Sessions wrote, Ozturk\u2019s case needs to be heard in court.\u201cThe Court concludes that this case will continue in this Court with Ms Ozturk physically present for the remainder of the proceedings,\u201d he wrote.The judge gave the government until May 1 to transfer Ozturk and set a bond hearing on May 9 for her to argue for a temporary release.Ozturk was sent to a detention facility in Louisiana, in what critics say is part of a government effort to keep detainees away from their supporters and lawyers \u2013 and place them in conservative-leaning legal districts. The Tufts University student was arrested near her home in Massachusetts on March 30. Surveillance footage of the incident shows masked immigration officers, who did not identify themselves as law enforcement, approaching her on the street and grabbing her hands.Critics have described the incident as an abduction.Her student visa has been revoked as part of a massive crackdown by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration on foreign students who have protested or criticised Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.Sessions confirmed that the only identifiable evidence that the US government is using to detain and deport Ozturk is the op-ed.\u201cHer evidence supports her argument that the government\u2019s motivation or purpose for her detention is to punish her for co-authoring an op-ed in a campus newspaper which criticized the Tufts University administration, and to chill the political speech of others,\u201d Sessions said.\u201cThe government has so far offered no evidence to support an alternative, lawful motivation or purpose for Ms Ozturk\u2019s detention.\u201dHe also stressed that the First Amendment, which protects free speech, \u201chas long extended\u201d to non-citizens living in the US.The case Sessions is overseeing is known as a habeas corpus petition. It challenges Ozturk\u2019s detention, not the broader push to deport her.Deportation matters are reviewed through a separate system, where non-citizens bring their cases in front of an immigration judge who works within the executive branch. It is not a separate part of the government, as the independent judiciary is.Advocates say immigration judges often \u201crubber-stamp\u201d the decisions of the executive branch under which they work. An immigration judge in Louisiana denied Ozturk\u2019s release on bail earlier this week.Immigration cases can be appealed to a board of immigration appeals, an administrative body. As a last resort, immigrants can petition to bring their case in front of a court of appeals that is part of the regular judicial system.The Trump administration has been stressing that the law gives it leeway over immigration issues \u2013 and that, in turn, offers the presidency broad powers that supersede concerns about free speech and due process.To authorise the deportations, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has invoked a rarely used provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that grants him the authority to remove non-citizens whom he deems to \u201chave serious adverse foreign policy consequences\u201d for the US.But part of Friday\u2019s ruling could have sweeping implications for Ozturk and other students facing deportation.Sessions dismissed the notion that detained immigrants can have their constitutional rights ignored because of an administrative process.The judge said the government is arguing that an immigration law \u201cgrants practically limitless, unreviewable power to detain individuals for weeks or months, even if the detention is patently unconstitutional\u201d."}

Israeli authorities, however, require them to acquire permits to travel to Jerusalem, making it difficult for many to join those celebrations.Moreover, Israeli settlers and the military also attacked Palestinian people on their land in the town of Biddya, in the Salfit governorate in the occupied West Bank, according to Al Jazeera Arabic on Friday, tempering the celebrations.The Palestine Red Crescent said that a Palestinian was injured in the attack.Local sources also told Al Jazeera Arabic that dozens of settlers stormed Jabal al-Urma, a hill in the town of Beita in the Nablus governorate, under the protection of the Israeli army.Settlers are Israeli citizens who live illegally on private Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.Israeli settler and military violence has soared across the West Bank \u2013 particularly in the north of the territory \u2013 since the war on Gaza began in October 2023. The United Nations has said this violence has displaced roughly 40,000 Palestinians since Israel began a new military operation in the occupied West Bank in January."}

But I found myself on the ground, exhausted, and wondering what had happened,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.In reality, one arm \u201cflew off, and one flew and fell right beside me\u201d, he added.Still unaware that he had sustained serious wounds \u2013 wounds that mutilated his entire body \u2013 Ajjour said he looked around and saw his arms.

I was very sad, and my mental state was very bad.\u201dHis mental health deteriorated further when he, like many others in Gaza, had to undergo surgery without anaesthetics due to a severe lack of medical supplies.

Baby formula is largely missing from the markets and pharmacies,\u201d Mahmoud said. \u201cGaza is quickly running out of all necessities.\u201dOutside Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah, Palestinians told Al Jazeera they are losing their children to malnutrition.Fadi Ahmed, who lost his son, said hospital staff discovered \u201cmassive infections in the boy\u2019s lungs, which led to a severe lack of oxygen in his blood\u201d.\u201cThe boy\u2019s weakness and severe malnutrition led to his inability to resist and then to his death \u2026 after spending one week at the hospital.\u201dIntisar Hamdan, a grandmother, said she lost her grandson because his parents could not find any milk for three days.\u201cChildren are suffering from not just malnutrition, but also serious medical complications and diseases that cannot be easily treated and require medical supplies that are scarce,\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum reported.According to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, at least 60,000 children are considered malnourished in the Palestinian territory.The aid groups said Gaza holds the record of being \u201cthe deadliest place on earth for humanitarian workers\u201d, making it even more difficult to deliver services to children.Since October 2023, more than 400 aid workers and 1,300 health workers have been killed in Gaza, despite the requirement under international humanitarian law for humanitarian and health workers to be protected.\u201cThe recent killing of 15 Palestinian paramedics and rescue workers, whose bodies were found buried in a mass grave, triggered global outrage, but many violations and attacks go unreported,\u201d it added.The aid groups are calling on Israel and the Palestinian armed group to guarantee the safety of their staff and to allow the safe, \u201cunfettered access of aid into and across Gaza\u201d, and for world leaders to oppose further aid restrictions."}

The president has also taken the fight to universities themselves, which have been the site of major protests since the war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023.Trump\u2019s latest battle is with Harvard University. The president froze more than $2bn in federal funding to the university, after it refused to make policy changes requested by his administration.They include repealing affirmative action in the admissions process, screening for students who may be \u201chostile to American values and institutions\u201d, and addressing anti-Semitism on campus.Earlier this week, the Department of Homeland Security said Harvard may be ineligible to host international students over its \u201cradical ideology\u201d and supporting \u201cforeign visa-holding rioters and faculty [who] have spewed anti-semitic hate\u201d."}

She now takes photos of badly wounded Palestinians based in Doha.\u201cThis is a quiet photo that speaks loudly.

According to the Harvard Crimson student newspaper, the letter from the Department of Homeland Security also accused the prestigious university of creating a \u201chostile learning environment\u201d for Jewish students, and reminded that it was \u201ca privilege to have foreign students attend Harvard University, not a guarantee\u201d.Noem also announced the cancellation of more than $2.7m in grants to the university, declaring the Ivy League school unfit to be entrusted with taxpayer dollars and accusing it of undermining American values and security.\u201cHarvard bending the knee to anti-Semitism \u2013 driven by its spineless leadership \u2013 fuels a cesspool of extremist riots and threatens our national security,\u201d Noem said.President Trump is furious at the storied university, which has produced 162 Nobel Prize winners, for rejecting his demand to submit to government supervision on admissions, hiring and political stance.The Trump administration has already frozen or cancelled some funding for universities such as Columbia, Princeton, Brown, Cornell and Northwestern, in his ongoing crackdown on pro-Palestinian activities among faculty and students across the US.Harvard has rejected numerous demands by the Trump administration that it said would cede control to the government. The Trump administration subsequently said it was freezing $2.3bn in funding.On Tuesday, Trump threatened to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status and CNN reported on Wednesday the US Internal Revenue Service was making plans to rescind the tax-exempt status of Harvard and that a final decision was expected soon.Reuters news agency quoted a Harvard spokesperson as saying that the university was aware of the Department of Homeland Security letter \u201cregarding grant cancellations and scrutiny of foreign student visas,\u201d but that the university stood by its statement earlier in the week not to cede control to the government.Harvard also said there was no legal basis to rescind its tax-exempt status, saying such an action would be unprecedented, would diminish its financial aid for students and would lead to the abandonment of some critical medical research programmes.Human rights advocates have raised free speech and academic freedom concerns over Trump\u2019s crackdown."}

It was later designated to honour all Palestinian prisoners and highlight Israel\u2019s ongoing detention of Palestinians and violation of their rights.There are currently nearly 10,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails in Israel and the occupied territory, according to prisoners\u2019 rights group Addameer. To Palestinians, they are political prisoners who must be freed.Of those in detention:Administrative detainees, including women and children, can be held by the military for renewable six-month periods based on \u201csecret evidence\u201d that neither the detainee nor their lawyer is allowed to see.Israel is the only country in the world that tries children in military courts, often denying them their basic rights.According to Defense for Children Palestine, about 500 to 700 Palestinian children are detained and prosecuted in the Israeli military court system each year \u2013 some as young as 12.The most common charge is throwing stones, a crime punishable under military law by up to 20 years in prison.Currently, 400 Palestinian children remain in Israeli prisons, most are in pre-trial detention and have not been convicted of any offence.One of the most harrowing child prisoner cases is that of Ahmad Manasra, who was arrested at the age of 13, brutally interrogated and then sentenced.Ahmad was with his cousin Hassan, who allegedly stabbed two Israeli settlers near an illegal Israeli settlement in occupied East Jerusalem in 2015.Hassan, who was 15 at the time, was shot and killed by an Israeli civilian, while Ahmad was severely beaten by an Israeli mob and run over by a car.He suffered fractures to his skull and internal bleeding.At the time, Israeli law stated that children under 14 could not be held criminally responsible.To circumvent this, Israeli authorities waited until Manasra turned 14 to sentence him. The law was changed in August 2016 to allow the prosecution of younger children.Ahmad was charged with attempted murder and sentenced to 12 years in prison. The sentence was later reduced to 9.5 years.Ahmad has long suffered from mental health issues. At the end of 2021, a psychiatrist from Doctors Without Borders (MSF) was allowed to visit him and diagnosed him with schizophrenia. This was the first time an external doctor was allowed to see him.On April 10, 2025, after spending more than nine years behind bars, Ahmad was finally released.From October 2023, when Hamas led an attack on southern Israel and Israel then began its war on Gaza, to April 2025, the number of Palestinian political prisoners doubled, rising from 5,250 to nearly 10,000.Since October 7, Israel has detained about 30,000 Palestinians. During the prisoner-captive exchanges with Hamas, Israel has released just more than 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.That means, for every person released, 15 others were apprehended.During the most recent ceasefire exchange earlier this year, 739 Palestinians from Gaza were freed, that\u2019s out of 15,000 that had been detained. While in the occupied West Bank, 652 were released, but nearly 14,500 have been detained.During the nearly two-month ceasefire earlier this year, Israel released 1,793 Palestinian political prisoners, while Hamas freed 38 Israeli captives, including eight bodies.The majority of those released were from Gaza, with 739 freed \u2013 337 from North Gaza, 227 from Gaza City, and 151 from Khan Younis, some of the war\u2019s hardest-hit areas. In the occupied West Bank, at least 652 prisoners were released, with most coming from Ramallah (118), Hebron (111), and Nablus (79).Israel\u2019s detention policies have deeply affected Palestinian life for decades. According to the Palestinian Commission of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs, since 1967, Israeli forces have detained an estimated one million Palestinians, or approximately 20 percent of the Palestinian population. Statistically, this means one out of every five Palestinians has been imprisoned at some point in their life.For many families, arrest has become an inevitability. This systemic practice has fragmented communities, perpetuated cycles of trauma, and generated widespread resentment.As Israel\u2019s arrest campaign continues, many Palestinians fear that mass imprisonment is not just a byproduct of occupation but a deliberate tool of control. For the thousands currently behind bars, freedom remains uncertain, just as it has for generations before them. "}

Such an agreement would need to include guarantees that have so far proven non-starters, including a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.Under the previous six-week ceasefire agreement, Hamas released a total of 33 captives held in Gaza in exchange for an increase in humanitarian aid into the enclave and the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.A second phase, agreed to in principle, was meant to see the release of all remaining captives held in Gaza in exchange for a permanent end to fighting. A third phase was meant to see the release of all the bodies of captives and the implementation of a reconstruction plan.But negotiations broke down following the completion of the first phase of the agreement, with Israel immediately renewing attacks. Beyond those killed, the United Nations has said at least 500,000 Palestinians have been newly displaced in the latest round of fighting.Earlier this week, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said the military had completed creating a \u201csecurity zone\u201d between the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis. He added that the Israeli military would \u201cvigorously\u201d expand its operation in Gaza.Israel has estimated that 24 living captives remain in Gaza, all believed to be male soldiers. The bodies of 35 other captives are also believed to still be in the Palestinian enclave.Boehler, who held direct talks with Hamas officials in March, spoke to Al Jazeera after Hamas rejected a new Israeli ceasefire proposal calling for the group to fully disarm the day before.Hamas also claimed on Tuesday that it had lost contact with the group holding Israeli-American captive Edan Alexander after \u201cdirect Israeli bombardment\u201d targeted the area where he was being held.Boehler dismissed the claim, saying he was certain Alexander was in a safe place and that Hamas would be \u201cstupid\u201d to harm him.If anything were to happen to Alexander, it\u2019s \u201cnot going to be pretty\u201d, he added, without elaborating."}

Israeli strikes in Lebanon have killed more than 70 civilians since the ceasefire took effect in November.Israel also established several military posts inside Syrian territory, including on the summit of Mount Hermon, after warplanes launched hundreds of strikes in the aftermath of the ousting of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.The Israeli government immediately revealed its position towards the new Syrian government led by the former opposition group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), calling it \u201ca terror group from Idlib that took Damascus by force\u201d, and has since refused to withdraw from the territories it seized.Katz said in a statement on X that Israel\u2019s policy was \u201cclear\u201d.\u201cNo humanitarian aid will be allowed into Gaza,\u201d the defence minister said on Wednesday.Preventing humanitarian aid from entering the Gaza Strip \u201cis one of the main pressure tools that stops Hamas from using this means against the population,\u201d he added.\u201cIn the current reality, no one is going to allow any humanitarian aid into Gaza, and no preparations are being made to allow any aid of this kind.\u201dIsraeli Culture Minister Miki Zohar echoed this position, saying, \u201cthe despicable murderers in Gaza deserve no humanitarian assistance from any civilian or military mechanism.\u201d\u201cOnly hellfire should be poured on the makers of terrorism until the last hostage returns from Gaza,\u201d Zohar said on X.Israeli authorities have blocked all aid from entering Gaza for more than six weeks, worsening the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza.The United Nations on Wednesday rejected a new authorisation mechanism that purported to introduce greater control over aid delivery in Gaza by Israeli forces, stating that aid organisations already had a mechanism in place to ensure that aid is not diverted to Hamas.\u201cAid delivery into Gaza has for too long been obstructed,\u201d the UN said, adding its teams were \u201cready to deliver assistance to those most in need based on humanitarian principles\u201d.Meanwhile, Israeli air raids continued on Wednesday, with at least 35 people killed in attacks across Gaza, medical sources told Al Jazeera. Palestinian journalist Fatima Hassouneh and 10 members of her family were killed in an Israeli air strike that targeted their home in Gaza City."}

MSF teams have had to leave many facilities, while others continue operating with staff and patients trapped inside, unable to leave safely for hours at a time, the charity said.\u201cWith nowhere safe for Palestinians or those trying to help them, the humanitarian response is severely struggling under the weight of insecurity and critical supply shortages, leaving people with few, if any, options for accessing care,\u201d Bazerolle said.Israel resumed aerial bombardment and ground operations in the Palestinian territory in March after it reneged on a two-month-old ceasefire. Thousands of people have since been killed, with many more displaced. Israel has also blocked humanitarian aid from entering Gaza since March 2.Medical supplies, fuel, water and other essentials are in short supply, the United Nations says.On Wednesday, Defence Minister Israel Katz said Israel\u2019s \u201cpolicy is clear and no humanitarian aid will be allowed into Gaza\u201d as it is \u201cone of the main pressure tools\u201d against Hamas.\u201cIn the current reality, no one is going to allow any humanitarian aid into Gaza, and no preparations are being made to allow any aid of this kind,\u201d he said.Israeli forces \u201cwill remain in the security zones as a buffer between the enemy and [Israeli] communities in any temporary or permanent situation in Gaza\u201d, he said.Al Jazeera\u2019s Nour Odeh, reporting from Jordan\u2019s capital, Amman, said the ongoing mediated efforts to get Israel and Hamas to agree on a new ceasefire seem to have reached \u201ca dead end\u201d.\u201cIsrael is trying to extort a temporary ceasefire deal in exchange for allowing critically needed aid back to Gaza. Israel will also only promise to discuss ending its genocidal war on Gaza if Hamas agrees to disarm and exile up to 200 of its members from the Strip,\u201d she said.\u201cHamas has shown flexibility on many issues, but the movement says laying down its arms without ending the occupation is a red line. But Hamas is running out of options. Gaza is in ruins. People are running out of hope and patience,\u201d Odeh added.Israeli forces have taken over large areas of Gaza in recent weeks. Together with the blockade, continued fighting has worsened the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza.At least 51,000 people, most of them children and women, have been killed in Israeli attacks since October 2023."}

Alleged war crimes from October 7, 2023, to May 31 are documented in the file, which is based on open-source material and witness testimonies.Al Jazeera interviewed Mansfield about the landmark case, his views on Israel\u2019s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and why he believes legal efforts against those involved in the onslaught remain important, even as critical rulings are ignored by those in power and mass killings continue unabated.Al Jazeera: What can you tell us about the case?Michael Mansfield: The reason I can\u2019t talk about the detail of it is perhaps obvious: \u2026 The people [accused] would immediately know who they were.If a UK national commits any serious crime abroad, \u2026 you are liable to be and are investigated, arrested, charged and tried here in the United Kingdom. This is nothing out of the ordinary in that sense.The out-of-the-ordinary bit, of course, is that it is linked to war crimes and crimes against humanity, which are international crimes.The United Kingdom can obviously investigate themselves, or the International Criminal Court can investigate and charge and so forth.Nobody can be unaware of the extent of the devastation, particularly in Gaza, although that\u2019s not the only place in the world where such things are happening. And in relation to those matters, the public are asking, \u201cWhat are we doing about it? What can we do about it?\u201dThe international institutions of justice and conventions on human rights were established just after the Second World War in order to prevent this happening, if at all possible, by intervening.[But] the United Nations\u2019s ability to intervene has been emasculated by the major nations \u2013 Russia and America nearly always opposing each other. On top of that, the United Kingdom sitting on the fence and abstaining on most of these issues.Slowly but surely, all the principles to do with the rule of law and rules-based democracy have been, essentially, denuded from practicality.The court finds it very difficult to do anything because the countries [allegedly behind war crimes] are seemingly immune. They don\u2019t mind what the international courts may think \u2013 either the International Criminal Court [or the] International Court of Justice.Al Jazeera: As most monitors and observers are unable to enter Gaza presently due to the Israeli siege, how did the researchers and lawyers behind the report identify those accused?Mansfield: Linking the individual [to the alleged crimes] is the problem. You\u2019ve got to be able to provide investigators with at least enough evidence for them to say this is worth investigating.They might say, \u201cWe can\u2019t do this. It\u2019s too difficult.\u201d Then they might hand it over to the International Criminal Court, which has more resources.There\u2019s something called the Berkeley Protocol, which is focused on how you would gather evidence from publicly available sources.Publicly available sources could be Al Jazeera [footage]. It could be somebody doing a selfie on their own phone.The research has already been done to ensure that the material on these 10 is sufficient for the police to take a decision whether they can do more or not.Al Jazeera: This month, Hungary withdrew from the International Criminal Court, which has issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu, ahead of a visit by the Israeli premier. If the global institutions that are meant to uphold human rights laws are under threat, decisions are sidestepped, and massacres continue in places like Gaza, what impact can legal efforts like yours have?Mansfield: I think they do make a difference for those of us who care.I mean, they don\u2019t make a difference to the perpetrators. They never have. And that\u2019s why they had the Nuremberg trials at the end of the Second World War.As a lawyer, I can\u2019t just sit back and say I\u2019ve wasted 55 years of my career. I\u2019ve got to be able to say I have strived hard to get a situation in which people are made accountable.The law has been unable to deliver. The law is there, the institutions are there, but until governments \u2026 start paying respect to the rule of law and not ignoring it, there are lots of different ways in which people can be made accountable. As lawyers and as thinking members of the public, we have to be at the ready to get the authorities to actually do their job because if we don\u2019t, no one else will, and it\u2019ll just get worse.The basic freedoms you and I enjoy when we can \u2013 freedom of association, movement, speech and so on \u2013 they\u2019re not divisible. What I mean by that is you might live on the other side of the world, but if it\u2019s your rights being attacked in this way, it\u2019s me as well. Make no mistake, when it\u2019s happening there, it could be you next.That sort of approach to human rights is not a sort of woke topic that just a few liberal lawyers think of. It\u2019s been fought hard for by other people. Lawyers in the past have fought very hard to set it all up.Al Jazeera: Do you classify what\u2019s happening in Gaza as a genocide?I do, yes, no question.In this particular instance, if you\u2019re attacked personally in the domestic sense or in any other, you\u2019re entitled to defend yourself but only up to a point.If you\u2019re attacked with somebody holding a wooden spoon, you can\u2019t use a machinegun to kill them. \u2026 This has gone far beyond self-defence.Of course, they [aggressors, in this case Israel] will always justify it and say that it\u2019s self-defence, but you only have to see what they\u2019ve done.A lot of the victims are women and babies and children and doctors and journalists. \u2026 They are protected individuals under the law. If they\u2019re not combatants, they\u2019re not to be annihilated in this way.In my view, it\u2019s clearly a genocide because they\u2019ve [Israeli officials] made it very clear in various statements. They\u2019re talking about a bigger Israel. There\u2019s a political ambition that lies behind the whole thing, not for all, you know, members of the [Israeli military] and so on, but I think a sizeable proportion.[They] obviously are adhering to that principle that they want to see Gaza wiped off the map, and yes, they would like it reinstated as a Riviera resort of the Trump empire.It\u2019s gone beyond plausible.[Note: The International Court of Justice said in January 2024 that it was plausible that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.]Al Jazeera: How will the world look back on this moment in history?Mansfield: I hope it will bring about change of some kind in people\u2019s hearts and minds.The leaders of the world have the right to do something about it, and I think that our own prime minister [UK Premier Keir Starmer] should do more than he\u2019s doing.Originally, we [the UK] objected to the issue of arrest warrants. However, that was the previous [Conservative] government and when [Labour\u2019s] Starmer was elected, he changed that. He withdrew his objections on behalf of the United Kingdom, so that was one step in the right direction.I think we\u2019ll look back and say, actually, thousands turn out for marches. Thousands of people are globally angry, upset and feeling hopeless, which is why keeping the law alive in the way the chief prosecutors tried to do, not just for Israel, but for other perpetrators as well, including [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and Russia and Ukraine.We\u2019ve got to keep the caring alive. You can\u2019t get away from it. You can\u2019t hide in your bedroom and think, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t start this.\u201d No, you didn\u2019t, but if you\u2019re a member of the human race, I\u2019m afraid you have a responsibility.If I don\u2019t spend every waking hour trying hard to keep what others set up in the first place [the rule of law], I feel I will have failed.You can\u2019t just back away from it and hope that it\u2019ll blow away because, well, that\u2019s what the politicians hope, that we\u2019ll all give up. I think it\u2019s [about] creating a well of public opinion, so that the politicians realise there\u2019s nowhere to go because actually they\u2019re not supported.You\u2019ve got to connect, engage and then do as much as you can. That\u2019s all that can be expected. Once you do that, you\u2019ll find hundreds and thousands of others doing the same, and then eventually politicians go, \u201cOh, right, there are votes here. We better do the right thing.\u201dIt\u2019s moving opinion all the time and keeping the flame alive.Al Jazeera: How would you summarise the ongoing atrocities?Mansfield: I would describe it as a mass assault and destruction of humanity. It doesn\u2019t get worse than that.Al Jazeera: You\u2019ve worked on high-profile cases, such as representing the family of Stephen Lawrence, the Black British teenager stabbed to death in a racist attack, and the Birmingham Six, the group of Irishmen wrongfully arrested for bombings in 1974. What binds the work you\u2019ve done together?Mansfield: It\u2019s the effect and impact on a community. Now the Lawrence case, as it turned out and as it was at the time, had a huge impact on a community. It represented a much bigger issue than, you know, the stabbing of Stephen Lawrence, which was horrific.Although it wasn\u2019t on your TV screens like Gaza and you didn\u2019t see destruction of the kind you see in Gaza, it had a similar effect on people.And there have been other cases like that. It\u2019s not about whether it\u2019s just one individual or thousands. It\u2019s about the impact on the principle of fairness.Note: This interview was edited for clarity and brevity."}

The group\u2019s armed wing later released a video warning families of the captives that their \u201cchildren will return in black coffins with their bodies torn apart from shrapnel from your army\u201d.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City, said Palestinians across the enclave believe that the US \u201chas an interest\u201d in securing Alexander\u2019s release in a negotiated deal.\u201cThey believe this will increase pressure on the Israeli government to speed up the process and come to an agreement,\u201d Mahmoud said. \u201cIf it is confirmed that Alexander has been killed, then the Palestinian groups will lose what they hoped would be a lever of pressure against the Netanyahu government to get him to sign a ceasefire agreement.\u201dHamas has previously blamed Israel for the deaths of captives held in Gaza, including as a direct result of bombardment, while also acknowledging on at least one occasion that a captive was killed by a guard. It said the guard had acted against instructions.Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff told reporters at the White House in March that securing the release of Alexander, believed to be the last living US hostage held by Hamas in Gaza, was a \u201ctop priority for us\u201d.The potential release of Alexander was at the centre of earlier talks held between Hamas leaders and US negotiator Adam Boehler last month.The announcement comes as Netanyahu said Israel would press on with its military offensive in Gaza to secure the release of captives and praised troops during a visit to the devastated north of the territory.\u201cThey are striking the enemy and Hamas will continue to suffer blow after blow. We insist that they release our hostages, and we insist on achieving all of our war objectives,\u201d Netanyahu told soldiers in Gaza, according to a statement from his office.In a phone call with Netanyahu, France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron said he told Israel\u2019s leader that the suffering of the people in Gaza \u201cmust end\u201d, and that only a ceasefire could free the remaining Israeli captives.Hamas released 38 captives under the last truce agreement that began on January 19. In mid-March, Israel\u2019s military resumed its ground and aerial offensive on Gaza, abandoning the ceasefire and reimposing a total blockade of Gaza.Hamas decried the ongoing blockade, saying Israel has been preventing the entry of \u201call essential items necessary for life, including food supplies, medicine and fuel\u201d.The United Nations has also warned that Gaza\u2019s humanitarian crisis is spiralling out of control.\u201cThe humanitarian situation is now likely the worst it has been in the 18 months since the outbreak of hostilities,\u201d said the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).Israeli forces continued to bombard areas across Gaza on Tuesday, killing at least 21 people, according to Gaza\u2019s civil defence.Since Israel\u2019s assault began in October 2023, more than 51,000 Palestinians have been killed, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.Israeli officials say that the offensive will continue until the remaining 59 captives are freed and until Hamas is demilitarised. Hamas insists it will free hostages only as part of a deal to end the war permanently, and has repeatedly rejected demands to lay down its arms.Israel issued a truce proposal to Egyptian and Qatari mediators on Monday, offering a 45-day temporary ceasefire in exchange for Hamas disarming and releasing 11 Israeli captives still held in Gaza.Hamas said in a statement it was \u201cstudying\u201d the proposal, but senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Al Jazeera prior to the release of the official statement that Hamas would not accept any demand to disarm."}

In this letter, they claimed \u201cHarvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment.\u201dThis was followed by a list of demands for the university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to fulfil. Key among them were:Harvard was given a deadline of August to implement these changes. This is the second letter issued by the Trump administration to Harvard. The first one was issued on April 3 and called on Harvard to ban face masks and reform academic departments that it alleged were guilty of anti-Semitic bias. Charges of anti-Semitism have been levelled against numerous US universities and colleges since widespread campus protests were held against the war in Gaza.Harvard\u2019s lawyers responded to the Trump administration by saying the university rejected the demands, arguing they violated its First Amendment rights and freedoms recognised by the US Supreme Court. The US Constitution\u2019s First Amendment upholds the rights to free speech, expression and assembly.The university said Harvard strongly opposes anti-Semitism and continues to make structural changes to ensure that the institution is a welcoming and supportive learning environment for all students.The university also published a separate letter online signed by President Alan Garber on Monday. In the letter, Garber said federal grants have led to research and innovation in fields pertaining to science and medicine. \u201cThese innovations have made countless people in our country and throughout the world healthier and safer,\u201d he wrote.The letter then referred to how the government had threatened to pull federal funding from several universities, including Harvard, over allegations of anti-Semitism on campus. The letter said the government retreating from its funding agreements with higher education institutions \u201crisks not only the health and well-being of millions of individuals but also the economic security and vitality of our nation\u201d.The Harvard letter said that while some of the government\u2019s demands are aimed at combating anti-Semitism, \u201cthe majority represent direct governmental regulation of the \u2018intellectual conditions\u2019 at Harvard.\u201d\u201cThe University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,\u201d Garber added.The Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors filed a lawsuit on Friday in a federal court in Boston, accusing the Trump administration of \u201cunlawful and unprecedented misuse of federal funding and civil rights enforcement authority to undermine academic freedom and free speech on a university campus\u201d.In his latest online post, Trump wrote, \u201cperhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting \u2018Sickness?\u2019 Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!\u201dIn January 2024, Garber had set up presidential task forces on campus to combat anti-Semitism and fight bias against Muslims and Arabs as Israel\u2019s war on Gaza raged, igniting tensions on campuses around the world, including in the US.In April 2024, pro-Palestine protesters set up an encampment on the Harvard campus, called Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine (HOOP). The protesters demanded that Harvard divest from weapons companies and companies associated with Israel.At that time, Garber said HOOP had disrupted educational activities on campus. In May, the university and protesters said they had reached an agreement to end the encampment, but the two parties gave different accounts about the terms of this agreement.While the student protesters said Harvard had agreed to their demands, the university said it had only opened itself to dialogue on the demands. For example, pertaining to the students\u2019 demand for the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel, Harvard said it had agreed to be more transparent with its students about how its endowment works.On Monday, hours after Harvard\u2019s response, a task force created by the US Department of Education to tackle anti-Semitism released a statement announcing that  $2.3bn in federal funding to the university had been frozen.\u201cHarvard\u2019s statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation\u2019s most prestigious universities and colleges \u2013 that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws,\u201d the statement said. The frozen federal funds to Harvard include $2.2bn in grants and $60m in contracts, the statement added.However, more money is at stake \u2013 about $9bn. On March 31, the Education Department, Department of Health and Human Services and the General Services Administration released a statement warning they would review $255.6m in contracts between the federal government and Harvard and its affiliates. The statement added that they would also review more than $8.7bn in multiyear grant commitments to Harvard and its affiliates.Harvard\u2019s endowment amounted to $53.2bn in the 2024 fiscal year \u2014 the largest of any university. However, donors decide which programmes, departments and purposes 70 percent of the annual endowment distribution is spent on. Endowment donations also dropped by $151m in 2024 as several billionaire donors stopped funding the institution over its response to concerns over anti-Semitism on campus, the university\u2019s student-run newspaper, the Harvard Crimson, reported in October.While Harvard is the first university to reject the Trump administration\u2019s demands, it is not the first Ivy League school to be targeted.Last year, Columbia University in New York emerged as the epicentre of pro-Palestine campus protests. Protesters occupied a campus building, Hamilton Hall, on April 30. The university called in the New York Police Department to crack down on student protesters.In February, the Trump administration pulled back Columbia\u2019s federal funding, worth $400m, citing the institution\u2019s \u201cfailure to protect Jewish students from anti-Semitic harassment\u201d. In March, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a recent Columbia graduate and protest leader who had negotiated with the university during the campus demonstrations. Days earlier, the US Department of State revoked the visa of Ranjani Srinivasan, who was an urban planning doctoral candidate at Columbia. Soon after, Columbia unenrolled Srinivasan, who flew to Canada before she could be deported.On March 13, the government\u2019s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism issued a letter to Columbia with nine demands for negotiations to restore the funding that was pulled. On March 18, Columbia accepted the government\u2019s demands, listed in a new memo. The memo said protesting students will have to present university identification if prompted. It added that face masks would be banned if they are being used to conceal a person\u2019s identity. However, face coverings are still allowed for religious or medical reasons. The memo also added that Columbia had hired 36 security officers who have special powers to arrest students, and the university continues to rely on New York police for additional security assistance.Over the past few weeks, the Trump administration has suspended or frozen funding for Princeton, Cornell and Northwestern universities. The universities have responded by expressing frustration and highlighting how federal funding is important for critical research.On April 11, the US Department of Energy, which funds research at many universities, announced a universal cap on the indirect costs it would finance for projects it supports. The agency said this would save the government $405m a year.Nine universities and three bodies representing higher education institutions have since filed a lawsuit challenging that cap. The plaintiffs in the case include the Association of American Universities, American Council on Education, Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities, Brown University, California Institute of Technology, Cornell University, Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the regents of the University of Michigan, Board of Trustees of Michigan State University, the trustees of Princeton University and the University of Rochester.Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders congratulated Harvard on X on Monday \u201cfor refusing to relinquish its constitutional rights to Trump\u2019s authoritarianism\u201d.Congratulations to Harvard for refusing to relinquish its constitutional rights to Trump\u2019s authoritarianism.Other universities should follow their lead.And instead of doing pro bono work for Trump, cowardly law firms should be defending those who believe in the rule of law.\u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 14, 2025Former US President Barack Obama posted on Tuesday: \u201cHarvard has set an example for other higher-ed institutions \u2013 rejecting an unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom.\u201dHarvard has set an example for other higher-ed institutions \u2013 rejecting an unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom, while taking concrete steps to make sure all students at Harvard can benefit from an environment of intellectual inquiry, rigorous debate and\u2026 https://t.co/gAu9UUqgjF\u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) April 15, 2025Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey posted a statement on X congratulating Harvard for \u201cstanding against the Trump Administration\u2019s brazen attempt to bully schools and weaponize the US Department of Justice under the false pretext of civil rights\u201d.My statement on @Harvard\u2019s response to demands from the Trump Administration. pic.twitter.com/IYa7LSG7iX\u2014 Maura Healey (@MassGovernor) April 14, 2025"}

The arrest is the latest in a controversial crackdown by the administration of President Donald Trump on immigrant student protesters.Shortly after Mahdawi\u2019s detention, District Judge William Sessions ordered that he must not be taken from the state of Vermont or the US.Senator Bernie Sanders and others from Vermont\u2019s congressional delegation labelled Mahdawi\u2019s detention \u201cimmoral, inhumane, and illegal\u201d, insisting that he must be afforded due process and released immediately.\u201cThe Trump administration detained Mohsen Mahdawi in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian,\u201d said his lawyer, Luna Droubi, who has submitted a court filing seeking his release and a halt to deportation proceedings.\u201cHis detention is an attempt to silence those who speak out against the atrocities in Gaza. It is unconstitutional.\u201dReporting from New York, Al Jazeera\u2019s Kristen Saloomey said the Trump administration appeared to be applying \u201cthe same rationale\u201d used in the detention of fellow Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, targeting \u201canyone deemed a threat to US foreign policy interests\u201d.Claire Finkelstein, a professor of national security law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, told Al Jazeera that Mahdawi\u2019s future remains uncertain.\u201cWe do not know, as of right now \u2026 whether or not the deportation is proceeding and whether or not the administration is actually going to listen to the court order,\u201d she said.Mahdawi is the co-founder of a Palestinian student group at Columbia University, alongside Khalil.A US immigration judge in Louisiana ruled on Friday that Khalil can be deported, setting a precedent for the administration to proceed with its efforts to deport dissenting foreign students, despite them being in the country legally and not being charged with any crime.In particular, foreign students involved in last year\u2019s campus protests across the US against Israel\u2019s war on Gaza have been targeted, with authorities accusing them of anti-Semitism.According to the website Insidehighered.com, the State Department has now revoked the student visas of more than 1,000 people at 170 colleges and universities.In other high-profile cases, immigration officers have detained and sought to deport Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student from Turkiye, and Columbia student Yunseo Chung, who is a US permanent resident originally from South Korea.U.S. immigration authorities summoned Columbia student leader Mohsen Mahdawi to a citizenship interview in Vermont \u2013 and then detained him without charge. He now faces deportation to the occupied West Bank. pic.twitter.com/LMmhpl3jnG\u2014 AJ+ (@ajplus) April 14, 2025Raised in a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, philosophy student Mahdawi was set to graduate next month, and planned to go on to attend a Columbia master\u2019s program, his lawyers said.Al Jazeera\u2019s Saloomey recalled Mahdawi telling Al Jazeera last year about previous attempts to intimidate him for his activism.On one occasion, a \u201ccounter-protester\u201d had approached him, saying: \u201cI\u2019m going to take your life. I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201dSpeaking of his experience growing up in the occupied West Bank, Mahdawi had recalled how his uncle was \u201cassassinated\u201d by the Israeli army and how he had collected the \u201cbody parts\u201d of seven Palestinians killed in his camp in the middle of the night."}

Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health says at least 50,983 Palestinians are confirmed dead and 116,274 wounded in Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.Hundreds of thousands of people have again been displaced since Israel resumed its campaign as well as imposed a total blockade on Gaza, forcing the territory into a state of siege and starvation."}

Washington says its campaign aims to stop Houthi attacks against Israel as well as shipping lanes in the Red Sea.However, the Yemeni group has pledged to continue its military operations until Israel ends its war and siege on Gaza in solidarity with Palestinians.Trump has been suggesting that the Houthi group \u2013 also known as Ansar Allah \u2013 has been severely weakened. But the Yemeni group says the US offensive has proven to be a failure and is only targeting civil officials and civilian infrastructure.On Sunday, a US strike targeted a ceramic factory in Sanaa province, killing six people and injuring 30 others, according to the Health Ministry.\u201cWe hold the American administration fully responsible for its continuing crimes and massacres against civilian dignitaries and civilians and its direct and repeated bombardment of infrastructure, industrial facilities and civil officials,\u201d the ministry said.On Monday, the Houthi-affiliated Al Masirah TV reported more US attacks, including 15 strikes in the Marib governorate.Despite the US campaign, the Iran-aligned Houthis \u2013 who present themselves as Yemen\u2019s official armed forces \u2013 said on Sunday that they fired two missiles at Israel and launched a separate drone attack against a \u201cvital\u201d target on the Israeli coast.\u201cThe Israeli enemy, along with the Americans, must realise that beloved Yemen \u2013 its leadership, people, and army \u2013 will not back down from its steadfast position in supporting and backing the oppressed Palestinian people \u2026 regardless of the repercussions and the outcomes,\u201d the Yemeni group said in a statement.The Houthi attack triggered sirens in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv on Sunday, but the Israeli army said it detected and intercepted one missile, not two.Hamas praised the latest attack, with the spokesperson of its military branch, Abu Obeida, saying that Palestinians will not forget the \u201chonourable\u201d stance of the Yemeni group.\u201cThe honest brothers in Yemen continue to insist on paralysing the heart of the Zionist entity, standing by Gaza, which is being subjected to a fierce genocide, despite paying a heavy price with their precious blood and their country\u2019s resources,\u201d Abu Obeida said in a statement."}

Thousands more have gone missing and are presumed to be dead under the rubble.The Gaza Ministry of Health said at least 38 people were killed by Israeli attacks on Sunday.United Nations experts and leading rights groups have accused Israel of carrying out a genocide against Palestinians.The Gaza Government Media Office on Monday accused Israel of imposing a policy of \u201csystemic starvation\u201d against Palestinians and rejected plans for Israel to control the distribution of humanitarian assistance \u2013 a task currently undertaken by aid groups and United Nations agencies.\u201cWe warn against the plan that the Israeli occupation is trying to pursue by establishing or using security companies and suspicious parties to distribute humanitarian aid,\u201d the office said.It added that the plan aims to advance Israel\u2019s \u201ccolonial agenda\u201d under the guise of humanitarian aid.Last year, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza, including using starvation as a weapon of war."}

Since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, tensions have flared as officials have moved to ban protests and cancel events while cultural institutes have distanced themselves from artists who raise awareness about the Palestinian cause.Here\u2019s what you should know:The four activists received initial letters in the post in January informing them they had lost the right of freedom of movement.Two months later, their lawyers received deportation letters from Berlin\u2019s state migration authority on behalf of their clients in which they were told to leave by April 21 or be forcibly removed.The activists are: Cooper Longbottom, a 27-year-old US citizen and university student, and cultural workers Kasia Wlaszczyk, a 35-year-old Polish national; Shane O\u2019Brien, 29; and Roberta Murray, 31. O\u2019Brien and Murray are Irish citizens.All four allegedly participated in a sit-in at the Free University of Berlin.On Friday in an emergency injunction, Berlin\u2019s state administrative court ruled that O\u2019Brien may remain until a full hearing is held. The temporary measure is one of interim relief when a court or legal authority acts to protect someone\u2019s rights or interests while a case is still being decided.The court said the migration authority failed to \u201cfulfil sufficiently its official duty of investigation\u201d when deciding to withdraw his European Union freedom of movement rights, according to The Irish Times.In a police report seen by Al Jazeera, incidents are listed from October last year onwards. German authorities said the activists have spread \u201canti-Semitic hatred and incitement\u201d as well as \u201canti-Israeli hatred\u201d.The four are accused of criminal acts such as resisting arrest, property damage and disturbing the peace.The document also refers to insulting remarks, alleging that some of the activists called a police officer a \u201cfascist\u201d. In Germany, insulting someone is classified as a defamation of honour offence and can be subject to legal punishment. Two were initially accused of this. One \u2013 O\u2019Brien \u2013 has since been acquitted.In a statement provided to Al Jazeera, the Berlin Senate Department for the Interior and Sport referred to an incident in question.\u201cA group of masked individuals willing to use violence forced their way into a university building. This led to significant property damage inside the building, including graffiti related to the Israel-Palestine conflict, as well as other criminal offences. As far as we are aware, the legal proceedings are still ongoing. No further details can be provided due to data protection regulations,\u201d it said.They have also been accused of supporting Hamas, but police have provided no evidence of this.The Intercept first broke the story, triggering a round of condemnation towards Germany from critics.The activists\u2019 legal team argued the charges are being used as a pretext to suppress political speech and assembly rights, particularly concerning Palestine.\u201cThe decisions to deport our clients have no valid legal basis,\u201d said lawyer Benjamin Dusberg, a member of the five-person legal team representing the activists. \u201cThis purely political justification is in no way compatible with the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. Not a word is mentioned that our clients protested against the genocide in Gaza and its support through German arms deliveries.\u201dWlaszczyk said the allegations are unfounded.\u201cI refuse to engage in dishonest accusations of anti-Semitism and falling into the trap of defending myself against this gross abuse of the term being thrown around by police, journalists and the state to slander and criminalise the pro-Palestinian movement,\u201d he told Al Jazeera. \u201cBy now, we all know that accusations of anti-Semitism have been turned by the German state into an authoritarian dog whistle and a racist tool which predominantly targets the Palestinian and Arab communities in Germany.\u201dThe deportation orders were issued as Germany faces accusations of a broader national clampdown on pro-Palestinian activism.These allegations have grown during Israel\u2019s latest war on Gaza, but they have haunted Germany even before October 2023.Since the Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, during which 1,139 people were killed and more than 200 were taken captive, Israel has killed more than 50,983 people in Gaza, including tens of thousands of children.In a statement, the four activists painted a bleak picture of Berlin over the past 18 months.\u201cRampant unrestrained police violence goes hand in hand with this repressive use of immigration law to silence pro-Palestinian voices and political dissent. Arbitrary arrests made at protests, combined with false charges, are used as pretexts to justify extrajudicial deportation measures, circumventing any notion of independent judicial process and the rule of law,\u201d they said.In recent years, Berlin authorities have banned pro-Palestinian demonstrations and national symbols associated with Palestinian identity.Germany said protests have been banned because of concerns about the potential for hate speech. Administrative courts have said they pose an \u201cimminent danger to public safety and order\u201d.Berlin has given schools a green light to ban the wearing of Palestinian keffiyeh scarves on the grounds that they may threaten \u201cschool peace\u201d.Additionally, chanting slogans like \u201cFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\u201d has been banned in certain contexts because they are seen as denying Israel\u2019s right to exist. In August, a protester was fined about $650 over the chant, which German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has described as a pro-Hamas slogan.Cultural institutions have lost public funding over ties to pro-Palestinian advocacy, raising concerns about artistic freedom and political repression in the country.President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on November 8, 2023, called on Arab communities in Germany to distance themselves from Hamas, a comment that saw him accused of discrimination.Furthermore, according to amendments to Germany\u2019s citizenship laws, applicants seeking naturalisation will be required to affirm Israel\u2019s right to exist.In the case of the activists, German authorities have cited the principle of \u201cStaatsrason\u201d \u2013 or reason of state \u2013 as a basis for the deportation orders.Israel\u2019s security is seen by Germany as its reason of state, given Nazi Germany\u2019s role in systematically murdering six million Jews during the Holocaust.\u201cThe immigration authorities themselves initially considered the deportation decisions to be illegal as none of our clients had a criminal record. But then they were instructed to do so by the Berlin Senate,\u201d Dusberg said.Internal emails reviewed by Al Jazeera confirm that Federal Foreign Office employees challenged the legality of the Berlin Senate\u2019s deportation request, but their objections were unsuccessful.\u201cIn the reasons for the decisions, direct reference is then made in the police report to the so-called Staatsrason. According to this report, our clients have acted in conflict with the reason of state,\u201d Dusberg added.While not codified into law, Staatsrason has shaped public discourse as a guiding state doctrine. Observers argued it fosters censorship, pitting democratic values like free speech and freedom of assembly against Germany\u2019s unwavering solidarity with Israel.In March last year, the Financial Times\u2019s Berlin bureau chief, Guy Chazan, wrote: \u201cAny criticism of Israel is now seen by some people in power as antisemitic. It is an approach that is tying Germans up in knots, inflaming social tensions and undermining the country\u2019s credibility in the Global South.\u201dAdding to the controversy surrounding Berlin\u2019s foreign policy as Israel\u2019s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza continues unabated, Friedrich Merz, the likely next German chancellor, recently invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Germany despite an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for the Israeli leader for alleged war crimes."}

Neither attack resulted in any injuries as warnings were sent in advance.Hellenic Train, the operator of passenger and cargo train services, was once a subsidiary of state-owned Hellenic Railways.In February, Greece\u2019s Air and Rail Accident Investigation Authority (HARSIA) said the 2023 accident was due to chronic safety gaps and that they still needed to be addressed to prevent a repeat.Christos Papadimitriou, the head of HARSIA, resigned on Wednesday, a move expected to further stall efforts to shed light on the country\u2019s worst rail disaster.A judicial investigation is expected to conclude this year."}

In unbearable conditions, its heroic doctors and nurses have cared for civilians who have endured 18 months of devastating violence\u201d.\u201cFor the only Christian hospital in Gaza to be attacked on Palm Sunday is especially appalling.

Diplomacy not more bloodshed is how we will achieve a lasting peace,\u201d Lammy wrote on X.Qatar said the attack on the last functioning hospital in northern Gaza was a \u201chorrific massacre and a heinous crime against civilians\u201d that constituted a grave violation of international humanitarian law.The Foreign Ministry warned about the expansion of the cycle of violence across the region and said the international community must assume its responsibilities in protecting civilians.Jordan also condemned the attack as well as Israel\u2019s systematic targeting of civilians in Gaza and the destruction of vital facilities that provide essential services to its population.Egypt, too, issued a statement, calling the attack a grave violation of international humanitarian law and international norms and appealing for the international community\u2019s intervention in halting the attacks.Branding it a \u201cheinous crime \u2026 [and] flagrant violation of all international laws and norms,\u201d Saudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the attack in the \u201cstrongest terms\u201d.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock questioned the modalities of the strike but stopped short of condemning the attack. \u201cThe cruel Hamas terror must be combated. But international humanitarian law applies, with a special obligation to protect civilian areas. How can a hospital be evacuated in less than 20 minutes?\u201d she asked in a post on X."}

He scooped up his five-year-old son, Mohammad, and he and Iman ran towards the gate.Mohammad has severe injuries across his body, including third-degree burns on his back and legs, but Yousef had to keep running with him.\u201cI was carrying my son, whose body was burned, and running while he screamed,\u201d Yousef said. \u201cHis back was bleeding \u2013 his wounds were bleeding heavily \u2013 and he was screaming in agony.\u201c[So many people\u2019s] injuries reopened from the sudden movement. I saw the family of a girl with spinal injuries trying to pull her bed, but it was stuck in the debris.\u201cJust seconds after we left the hospital, it was struck by two missiles that shook the entire place. I told my wife: \u2018Imagine if we had been a minute later. We\u2019d be dead.'\u201dYousef and his wife were in the street with everyone else from the hospital.\u201cIt was around 2am, and I had no idea where to take my injured son. He was in pain and bleeding. There were no clinics or hospitals, and the tent we live in is very far and completely unsuitable for his condition.\u201dMohammad had been injured in an Israeli air strike on a block of homes in Gaza\u2019s Shujayea neighbourhood, which killed more than 20 people and wounded dozens.An hour after the hospital was bombed, Yousef and his wife decided there was nothing they could do other than take Mohammad back to al-Ahli.\u201cThe place was pitch-black, and it reeked of gunpowder and dust. I went to the surgery building at the far end of the hospital, where I found a nurse who took pity on Mohammad\u2019s condition, treated his wounds and admitted him.\u201dBombing a hospital like this, Yousef said, is a stain on humanity\u2019s conscience.\u201cThey bomb our homes over our heads and then bomb hospitals while patients and the wounded are inside. Where are we supposed to go?\u201cIsn\u2019t all this grief and suffering enough?\u201dSuhaib Hamed, 20, was asleep in another tent ward, right next to the hospital\u2019s emergency building, which was hit.Hamed was injured when he went to fetch flour for his starving family on February 29, 2024 \u2013 a day known as the \u201cFlour Massacre\u201c, during which Israel killed 109 Palestinians and wounded dozens while they waited for food aid.He was shot in the leg by Israeli tanks, damaging his bones and tissue to the point that he needed metal implants and has been in the orthopaedic department since then.\u201cMy brother, who usually stays with me, wasn\u2019t there. I don\u2019t even know how I managed to stand on my injured leg, grab my crutches and flee,\u201d Suhaib told Al Jazeera as he exited the surgery department after having the wounds to his leg cleaned and checked.\u201cI forgot my pain because of what I saw around me. Everyone was screaming in terror and fear, just trying to survive. It felt like the Day of Judgement.\u201dSuhaib also managed to get out of the hospital minutes before two Israeli missiles landed.\u201cMy leg couldn\u2019t handle it any more, and my wound reopened and started bleeding again.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t keep walking, so he stopped and called his brother, who came and supported him to their home in the Zeitoun neighbourhood, a half-hour\u2019s walk for a healthy person on undamaged roads.The pain in his leg kept Suhaib up, but he was also worried about the hospital being forced to close.\u201cI\u2019ve been staying in the hospital [for more than a year] because of my condition,\u201d he said. Suhaib has a medical referral to travel outside Gaza for treatment but has been waiting to leave for a year.\u201cIsn\u2019t the closure and banning of our travel enough? They even target the hospital that was still treating us with the little that\u2019s available.\u201dThe Israeli strike on al-Ahli has exacerbated an already catastrophic situation for Gaza\u2019s healthcare system, which has been collapsing as Israeli bombardments and a blockade on medicines, medical supplies and fuel continues.In the panic that ensued because Israel did not give hospital staff even the bare minimum of time to evacuate patients, a child died due to lack of oxygen, Fadel Naeem, director of al-Ahli, told Al Jazeera.Israel destroyed the vital emergency, radiology, laboratory and central pharmacy departments, the doctor continued.\u201cWe\u2019ll need weeks or months to resume operations,\u201d he noted. \u201cThis hospital is a hub for services and includes all essential facilities, including the only CT scan machine available.\u201cThe fate of patients and the wounded is now unknown. We\u2019ll have to distribute them to other hospitals, but no hospital is equipped to provide full services.\u201d"}

In the days leading up to the incident, the hospital director reportedly received warnings from Israel. Israel attributed the explosion at the facility to a misfired rocket launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an allegation denied by the armed group.An ambulance convoy was destroyed by an Israeli air attack outside al-Shifa Hospital, resulting in many Palestinian deaths.An air raid on al-Awda Hospital killed Dr Mahmoud Abu Nujaila and Dr Ahmad al-Sahar of Doctors Without Borders (MSF), and another doctor, Ziad al-Tatari.Several people were killed while sheltering about 150 metres (about 500 feet) from the entrance of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. Evacuees sheltering in the area suffered due to fighting and forced evacuation orders.The Israeli military said it killed 90 people in its raid on al-Shifa Hospital during a siege as displaced Palestinians sheltering in the facility described long detentions and abuse. Hamas condemned the \u201cbloody massacre\u201d in the hospital and said civilians, patients and displaced people were among those killed.Many people were killed and injured in an air raid on the yard of Al-Aqsa Hospital, just outside the emergency room where many internally displaced people were sheltering.A 14-day siege of al-Shifa Hospital, the largest hospital in the enclave, by Israeli forces saw hundreds of people killed, including medical staff, and mass arrests of its staff and others.An Israeli air attack on Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah killed five people and wounded 65. Tents of displaced people caught fire while people were sleeping.The Israeli army arrested Dr Hussam Abu Safia, the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, after refusing to follow orders to abandon one of the last functioning hospitals in northern Gaza. His arrest came a day after the military killed approximately 20 Palestinians and apprehended about 240 in a raid inside the hospital, which was one of the \u201clargest operations\u201d conducted in the territory until that time.Israeli forces laid siege to the Indonesia Hospital in Beit Lahiya for days. The Israeli forces left the hospital in ruins, with charred and decomposing bodies piling up in corners.The Indonesian Hospital in north Gaza was put out of service following repeated attacks by Israeli forces, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health.Israeli forces reportedly shot 15 Palestinian medics, working for the Palestine Red Crescent Society, dead during a rescue mission in Rafah\u2019s Tal as-Sultan neighbourhood. A video recovered from the mobile phone of one of the killed Palestinian medics showed Israeli forces\u2019 involvement, igniting widespread outrage."}

The attack also resulted in other collateral damage to the surrounding buildings, including the church building of St. Philip\u2019s, it added.\u201cThe Diocese of Jerusalem is appalled at the bombing of the hospital now for the fifth time since the beginning of the war in 2023 \u2013 and this time on the morning of Palm Sunday and the beginning of Holy Week,\u201d the statement said.In October 2023, Palestinian health officials said nearly 500 people had been killed in an Israeli air attack on the al-Ahli Hospital. Israel attributed the explosion at the facility to a misfired rocket launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an allegation denied by the armed group.Israel has repeatedly attacked hospitals in the Palestinian enclave with impunity throughout its devastating war \u2013 according to the Government Media Office in Gaza, Israel has targeted 36 hospitals since October 2023.In a statement later on Sunday, the Israeli military said the hospital was targeted because it was being used as a \u201ccommand and control\u201d centre by the \u201cterrorist organization Hamas\u201d. In a post on X, it said that \u201csteps were taken to reduce the chance of harm to civilians and the hospital, including providing early warning in the area.\u201dIsrael has in the past claimed that attacks on civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, are necessary to target armed fighters. It has, however, not provided proof to back its claims.The Government Media Office in Gaza described the attack as a \u201cflagrant violation of all international charters and the Geneva Conventions prohibiting the targeting of medical facilities\u201d.It said in a statement that al-Ahli Hospital was \u201cone of the oldest and most important health institutions\u201d in Gaza, describing the bombing as a \u201cheinous\u201d and \u201cterrible\u201d crime.Hamas called the attack on the hospital as a \u201cnew war crime\u201d, and said the Israeli military had no regard for humanitarian laws and norms. It held the United States, Israel\u2019s main ally, responsible for the \u201cbrutal crime\u201d.Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, said the bombing had left \u201ccritically ill patients, including those in the surgical and emergency units, are now left without shelter or oxygen\u201d.He added there were fears some patients could die because of the loss of medical care.Razan al-Nahhas, an emergency doctor who previously worked at al-Ahli Hospital, told Al Jazeera at least three people, including a 12-year-old boy with a head injury, have been reported dead following the forced evacuation.\u201cHe was on oxygen, as were the two other patients, and the family basically walked with them to a nearby hospital, a very small facility with no capacity for the number of patients heading their way. And they [the patients] arrived dead,\u201d said al-Nahhas, who is in the city of Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza.The attack came after Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health said Israeli attacks have killed at least 1,560 people since Israel broke a fragile ceasefire with Hamas on March 18. According to Palestinian Civil Defence spokesperson Mahmoud Basal, at least 500 children are among the dead since Israel resumed its offensive.In its latest update on Sunday, the Health Ministry in Gaza said at least 50,944 Palestinians have now been confirmed and 116,156 wounded since the start of the war. Israel began attacking Gaza after an estimated 1,139 people were killed during a Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on October 7, 2023, with more than 200 also taken captive.On Saturday, the Israeli military said it had encircled Rafah, in the south of Gaza, cutting it off from the rest of the territory. It also ordered residents in Khan Younis and Nuseirat to leave immediately, warning of imminent attacks \u201cwith great force\u201d.The forced displacement orders came as Hamas said it had fired three rockets from the Gaza Strip towards Israeli territory. The Israeli military said its air force intercepted all three rockets. No casualties were reported."}

The world accepts it, but Netanyahu rejects it,\u201d it said.\u201cThe blood of Gaza\u2019s children and the occupation\u2019s prisoners are victims of Netanyahu\u2019s ambitions to remain in power and to escape prosecution\u201d.Al Jazeera\u2019s Nour Odeh, reporting from Jordan\u2019s capital Amman, said the Israeli defence minister had given Palestinians an ultimatum. \u201cTopple Hamas and deliver the Israeli captives, Katz said, that\u2019s the only way to end the war,\u201d Odeh said.About 2.1 million Palestinians are now squeezed into about one-third of Gaza and no trucks carrying aid, food, cooking gas, or fuel have entered the Strip since Israel reimposed a blockade last month. Katz has publicly stated that, since breaking the ceasefire with Hamas on March 18, Israel\u2019s goal has been to apply pressure on the civilian population, the correspondent added.Robert Geist Pinfold, a lecturer in international security at King\u2019s College London, told Al Jazeera that while Israel says the creation of the Morag Corridor is purely operational and meant to constrain Hamas, it appears to be part of a longer-term Israeli strategy to control Gaza from afar.\u201cIsrael has always sought to control the Gaza Strip, particularly to oversee what comes in and what comes out and \u2018security\u2019 over the territories, as Israel would call it,\u201d he said.\u201cThese [Morag, Netzarim and Philadelphi] corridors are named after settlements, and the settlements did not appear there randomly. They were put there for this specific purpose: to cut off Gaza\u2019s urban areas and give Israel the ability to squeeze the territory when and if it desires.\u201d"}

Hundreds of them were children, according to rescuers.A total of 50,933 people have been killed and 116,045 wounded since the start of the war in October 2023, the ministry added in its latest daily update.On Saturday, an Israeli attack on Gaza\u2019s Tuffah neighbourhood killed at least people and wounded two children. Two other Palestinians were killed in al-Atatra district of Beit Lahiya, in the northern part of Gaza, with another killed in an Israeli drone attack on the Qizan an-Najjar area, south of Khan Younis.Several casualties were also reported following Israeli air raids on the tent shelters of civilians in the al-Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis, which Israel had designated a so-called \u201csafe zone\u201d.Reporting from outside al-Ahli Hospital in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, Al Jazeera\u2019s Hind Khoudary said a newborn named Sham had succumbed to her wounds after her family was hit in an attack.\u201cShe was in very critical condition where her arm was amputated and she died a couple of hours later, because her injury was very critical and doctors were unable to help her situation,\u201d she said.Khoudary reported that the ambulances arriving daily to the hospital have mostly been carrying children and women.\u201cDue to the lack of medical supplies, most of these Palestinian children and women are witnessing a very deteriorating situation,\u201d she added.On Friday, Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, reported that 36 of the 224 documented Israeli strikes in Gaza, between March 18 and April 9, involved killings of women and children.In a statement, the Palestinian rights group Al-Haq said the findings by the UN further confirmed a pattern it previously identified.\u201cSuch a calculated effort to exterminate women, boys, girls & even infants, has not been witnessed in any other modern conflict,\u201d Al-Haq said in a post on social media.In an interview with Al Jazeera\u2019s Upfront, UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) chief Philippe Lazzarini described the situation in Gaza as a \u201cpost-apocalyptic\u201d killing zone.Speaking at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum in Turkiye on Friday, Lazzarini also reiterated that Israel has been preventing the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other vital humanitarian supplies into Gaza since early March, contravening international law.In a separate post on X on Saturday, UNRWA Director of Communications Juliette Touma warned that all basic supplies \u201care running out\u201d in Gaza.\u201cIt means babies, children are going to bed hungry.\u201dIsrael has pledged to press on with its military offensive, with officials in recent days outlining plans to seize new swaths of territory in southern Gaza and issuing a series of forced displacement orders.\u201cPalestinians do not know where to go,\u201d Khoudary said, after the latest Israeli orders on Saturday for Shujayea and Khan Younis.According to UNRWA, some 400,000 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced across Gaza since the fragile ceasefire that took effect in January collapsed almost a month ago."}

But the judge\u2019s decision is not the final say over whether Khalil will be deported.In a separate case in New Jersey federal court, US District Judge Michael Farbiarz has blocked deportation while he considers Khalil\u2019s claim that his arrest was made in violation of the US Constitution\u2019s First Amendment protections for freedom of speech.Over the past several weeks, US immigration authorities have also cracked down on several international students who have taken part in pro-Palestinian protests or spoken out in defence of Palestinians in Gaza."}

If the publication is true, these are shocking and condemnable words coming from someone who will be the one to decide the fate of the kidnapped men and women,\u201d the forum said in a statement on Friday.\u201cAppointing a Shin Bet chief who puts Netanyahu\u2019s war before the abduction of the kidnapped is tantamount to committing a crime and doing injustice to the entire people of Israel,\u201d the group said.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, says Netanyahu\u2019s new appointment \u201cwants military pressure and escalation in the war on Gaza, and that\u2019s why he was chosen\u201d.\u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of pressure on Netanyahu internationally in the last couple of weeks to try to get Israel to end the blockade of Gaza and stop the war altogether, and the expanding military operations. The military says all the brigades called up are now operating inside Gaza, she continued.\u201cFamily members say the intensified attacks will only kill the remaining captives. But Netanyahu is part of the most right-wing Israeli government in Israel\u2019s history \u2013 people who have largely been against any ceasefire deal, largely against any end to the war\u201d, she added.Netanyahu\u2019s decision to appoint Zini came just one day after Israel\u2019s Supreme Court found his attempt to fire outgoing Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar to be \u201cunlawful\u201d, citing a conflict of interest tied to Netanyahu\u2019s ongoing corruption trial.Despite the court ruling that Netanyahu could not appoint a replacement, he proceeded with the appointment of Zini anyway.The attorney general later warned that the prime minister had defied legal guidance and tainted the appointment process.The criticism comes as Netanyahu still faces an international arrest warrant request from the International Criminal Court over war crimes committed during the Gaza war."}

At least 53,822 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since October 7, 2023 and more than 122,382 others wounded \u2013 most of them women and children.Israel claims about 300 trucks have entered Gaza since Monday through the Karem Abu Salem crossing, known as Kerem Shalom to Israelis, but the UN says only a third of those deliveries have reached warehouses inside the enclave due to security constraints and chaos on the ground.The figure is far short of the more than 500 trucks that entered Gaza daily before the start of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza in October 2023.A new United States-backed delivery mechanism \u2013 run by the newly established Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) \u2013 is expected to take over aid distribution by the end of the month. Under the plan, private contractors would escort supplies to secure hubs, where civilian teams would handle distribution.But the UN has refused to participate, saying the scheme does not meet basic humanitarian standards.\u201cThe United Nations has been clear: we will not take part in any scheme that fails to respect international law and the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality,\u201d Guterres said.He stressed that the UN already has the infrastructure to respond. \u201cThe supplies \u2013 160,000 pallets, enough to fill nearly 9,000 trucks \u2013 are waiting,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is my appeal for life-saving aid for the long-suffering people of Gaza: let\u2019s do it right.

Together, they represent part of a small but increasingly visible groundswell of resistance in Israel to a war that, for a variety of reasons, many Israelis are turning their backs on.\u201cSome people are protesting because they see it as a political war,\u201d Green, who also serves as national co-director of the activist group Standing Together, said of the growing sense in Israel that the war on Gaza only serves to sustain Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing coalition.\u201cSome are tired of fighting, some want the hostages [to be released from Gaza] , and some [are protesting against] what we\u2019re doing to Palestinians. All are welcome,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou want to resist the government? You\u2019re welcome. You don\u2019t want to enlist? You\u2019re welcome. You supported the war until just recently? You\u2019re welcome.\u201dPolls in Israel show that the majority now favour a deal that would secure the release of the captives held in Gaza, even if that means an end to the war on Gaza. Nevertheless, the war has continued.\u201cI don\u2019t know if popular pressure\u2019s going to ever stop the war,\u201d said Green. \u201cI mean, its supporters have been in a minority for a year. Refusing [to answer the call up] is our most powerful weapon: no soldiers, no occupation. We need more and more people to refuse.\u201dAll the antiwar activists Al Jazeera spoke to talked of an uptick in interest in their movement following the Israeli government\u2019s unilateral decision in mid-March to collapse the ceasefire it had previously agreed to after months of negotiation.Others spoke of a dramatic increase in support when, after 11 weeks of unremitting siege on Gaza, Israel announced its latest mass ground operation in the devastated Palestinian territory on May 17, intended, according to one Israeli official, to lead to \u201cthe conquest of the Gaza Strip and the holding of the territories\u201d.Before its latest offensive, Israel called up what it said were \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of reservists to bolster its numbers in Gaza.Speaking after the announcement of the latest military attack on Gaza, Israel\u2019s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was clear in what he saw as the aims of the offensive, saying that, within months, Gaza would be \u201ctotally destroyed\u201d and what remains of its pre-war population of more than two million would be exiled to a narrow strip of land along the Egyptian border.However, despite the new offensive to recapture ground already largely destroyed by the Israeli military, dissent is gaining ground.Open letters protesting the war from military units and reservists publicly refusing to turn up for service are becoming more frequent. In April, more than a thousand of Israel\u2019s current and former pilots, generally regarded as an elite unit, wrote an open letter protesting a war they said served the \u201cpolitical and personal interests\u201d of Netanyahu, \u201cand not security ones\u201d.There are no official numbers for how many reservists have not turned up for duty. But, according to Israeli media reports, the number may be as high as 100,000. Those numbers are in addition to those refusing their initial period of mandatory military service.Most of those are \u201cgrey\u201d refusals, activists say. That is, people who gave no political reason for refusing to serve, officially refusing for other reasons, such as declining on medical grounds.But Sofia Orr, a 19-year-old from Pardes Hannah in northern Israel, is one of a growing number of conscripts refusing their mandatory service and making that refusal as public as possible.Orr refused to serve three times after first being called up on February 24, 2024. Her first and second refusals each netted her 20 days in military prison. Her third cost her 45 days.\u201cI\u2019d already decided to refuse when I was 15,\u201d Orr told Al Jazeera. \u201cI asked myself, \u2018If I go and serve in the military, what cause am I serving, does it align with my values, who am I actually helping?\u2019\u201d she said.\u201cIf I enlist, am I just entering the cycle of bloodshed that occupies and bloodily oppresses Palestinians daily?\u201d she said of defying what she described as hardwired societal expectations of Israeli life.\u201cI wanted to challenge that, so it wasn\u2019t just about refusing, but doing so as publicly and loudly as possible. I needed people to see it and know that we exist, that they could do the same, to bring Palestinian suffering into Israeli society and for Palestinians to see it and know they were not alone,\u201d she said.Orr is a member of \u201cMesarvot\u201d, an Israeli organisation that has been supporting conscientious objectors in the face of calls from prominent politicians for refusers to be arrested and prosecuted, including from cabinet member and former Israeli military spokesperson Miri Regev.\u201cThere\u2019s been a steady growth of refusers since October 7,\u201d Nimrod Flaschenberg, a political analyst and spokesperson for Mesarvot said, referring to the 2023 attack on southern Israel that led to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been seeing an exponential increase of 16-, 17-year-olds refusing to serve recently. There are around a hundred circulating an open letter, all refusing service and explaining why.\u201dOf the wider movement, Flaschenberg said, some refused to serve in a war they had come to regard as political, others because they felt it risked the lives of the captives and a minority out of revulsion for the mass killing in Gaza and the West Bank that they were being asked to participate in.\u201cThere\u2019s still an Israeli public taboo over showing any public sympathy for Palestinians,\u201d Flaschenberg said of the low prominence given to Gaza in the reasons given by most refusers, contrasting that with the widespread outrage that greeted ex-General and leader of Israel\u2019s Democrats party, Yair Golan, because he warned that Israel risked becoming regarded as a \u201cpariah state\u201d that killed Palestinian babies \u201cas a hobby\u201d if it didn\u2019t \u201creturn to sanity\u201d.\u201cThat really demonstrates the level of ignorance we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Flaschenberg said. \u201cOf course, Israel is killing babies, but Israelis just can\u2019t accept that.\u201dHowever, while growing international condemnation of Israel concentrates on vilifying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to Orr, it risks overlooking a harsher reality.\u201cFor many people here, it\u2019s Israelis who are the real victims, the first, the last and only victims in all of this,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t even see Palestinians as people, just as a threat.\u201dGreen, who immediately rejoined the protest on the Gaza border after his overnight release from house arrest was over, was equally fatalistic.\u201cI\u2019m not confident we\u2019ll succeed. The government has represented a minority of Israelis for around a year, and the war\u2019s continued,\u201d he said.But, despite that, he was not ready to give up on calling for Israelis to wake up.\u201cThings are already bad enough,\u201d Green added. \u201cWe\u2019ve destroyed nearly every building in Gaza, we\u2019ve killed 18,000 babies, and about 53,000 people. This is something we\u2019re going to have to live with.\u201d\u201cDo we really want to live with any more?\u201d"}

Her injunction is set to last for approximately two weeks, and she set hearing dates on May 27 and 29.Friday\u2019s lawsuit against the Trump administration is Harvard\u2019s second in less than two months.The latest is a response to a decision on Thursday announced by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Her department oversees the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, and she said she is revoking Harvard\u2019s privilege to use the system based on its failure to address Trump administration concerns.\u201cThis administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,\u201d she wrote on social media.The revocation means that Harvard can no longer accept foreign students. Those already enrolled will need to transfer to another school.The move represents a major escalation in Trump\u2019s pressure campaign against Harvard and other top US universities. He has accused schools of allowing anti-Semitism to fester, promoting \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d diversity programmes, and pushing ideological slants.But in Friday\u2019s lawsuit, Harvard called the Trump administration\u2019s actions a \u201cblatant violation\u201d of the US Constitution and other federal laws.Barring the prestigious Ivy League school from enrolling its international students would have an \u201cimmediate and devastating effect\u201d on the university and the more than 7,000 visa holders in its student body, it argued.\u201cWith the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard\u2019s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cWithout its international students, Harvard is not Harvard.\u201dTrump\u2019s current battle against higher education can be largely traced back to the pro-Palestine protests that broke out on US campuses last year, in response to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Trump made cracking down on the antiwar protests a centrepiece of his 2024 re-election campaign.While there have been instances of harassment from participants on both sides of the issue, protest organisers have rejected claims of widespread anti-Jewish sentiment. Some campus protests have even been spearheaded by Jewish students and organisations, including Jewish Voice for Peace.Earlier this year, task forces at Harvard itself issued two reports, warning about instances of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias, as well as anti-Semitism.Harvard has said it is working to address these concerns. Nevertheless, in April, Harvard became the latest school to receive a list of demands from the Trump administration.The list included reforming its hiring and admissions practices, refusing to admit students deemed \u201chostile to the American values and institutions\u201d, doing away with diversity programmes, and auditing academic programmes and centres, including several related to the Middle East.Harvard rejected the demands and immediately faced a freeze in $2.2bn in multi-year grants and $60m in multi-year contracts. Several federal agencies have since frozen tens of millions of dollars more in grants to Harvard.The university responded to Trump\u2019s funding freezes with a lawsuit in April, saying the administration was violating the First Amendment of the US Constitution with its \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d cuts.Trump has also floated revoking Harvard\u2019s tax exempt status, and in April, Noem sent a letter to Harvard first threatening to revoke its Student and Exchange Visitor Program approval if administrators did not send information on any foreign students\u2019 \u201cillegal and violent activities\u201d.At the end of April, Harvard said it had provided all legally required information, without providing further details.Friday\u2019s lawsuit seeks immediate relief from the Trump administration\u2019s decision to de-certify Harvard\u2019s ability to register foreign students, citing \u201cirreparable harm inflicted by this lawless action\u201d.In response to the complaint, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson accused the school of doing too little to address the Trump administration\u2019s concerns.\u201cIf only Harvard cared this much about ending the scourge of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators on their campus, they wouldn\u2019t be in this situation to begin with,\u201d Jackson said.\u201cHarvard should spend their time and resources on creating a safe campus environment instead of filing frivolous lawsuits,\u201d she added.In a letter to the Harvard community, school President Alan Garber framed Trump\u2019s attack on Harvard\u2019s foreign student body as part of \u201ca series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence\u201d.Garber described the de-certification as evidence of the \u201cfederal government\u2019s illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body\u201d.In its complaint, Harvard said the de-certification has thrown \u201ccountless\u201d academic programmes, clinics, courses and research laboratories into disarray.Harvard enrolled nearly 6,800 international students in its current school year, equal to 27 percent of its total enrolment.On Thursday, Noem also said Harvard could avoid the move if it turned over more information on foreign students, including video or audio of their protest activity over the past five years.Harvard has maintained it has already met the legal requirements in its disclosures."}

There has been heavy, deadly bombardment in the area daily.The al-Najjar children were among dozens killed in Israel\u2019s attacks on Friday and Saturday.According to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, the bodies of 79 people killed in Israeli attacks were brought to hospitals between Friday and midday Saturday. That count does not include facilities in the north of the enclave that are inaccessible, it said.The ministry puts the overall death toll in Gaza since October 2023 at 53,901, with 122,593 injured."}

At least 53,822 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since October 7, 2023 and more than 122,382 others wounded \u2013 most of them women and children.Israel claims about 300 trucks have entered Gaza since Monday through the Karem Abu Salem crossing, known as Kerem Shalom to Israelis, but the UN says only a third of those deliveries have reached warehouses inside the enclave due to security constraints and chaos on the ground.The figure is far short of the more than 500 trucks that entered Gaza daily before the start of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza in October 2023.A new United States-backed delivery mechanism \u2013 run by the newly established Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) \u2013 is expected to take over aid distribution by the end of the month. Under the plan, private contractors would escort supplies to secure hubs, where civilian teams would handle distribution.But the UN has refused to participate, saying the scheme does not meet basic humanitarian standards.\u201cThe United Nations has been clear: we will not take part in any scheme that fails to respect international law and the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality,\u201d Guterres said.He stressed that the UN already has the infrastructure to respond. \u201cThe supplies \u2013 160,000 pallets, enough to fill nearly 9,000 trucks \u2013 are waiting,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is my appeal for life-saving aid for the long-suffering people of Gaza: let\u2019s do it right.

Together, they represent part of a small but increasingly visible groundswell of resistance in Israel to a war that, for a variety of reasons, many Israelis are turning their backs on.\u201cSome people are protesting because they see it as a political war,\u201d Green, who also serves as national co-director of the activist group Standing Together, said of the growing sense in Israel that the war on Gaza only serves to sustain Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing coalition.\u201cSome are tired of fighting, some want the hostages [to be released from Gaza] , and some [are protesting against] what we\u2019re doing to Palestinians. All are welcome,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou want to resist the government? You\u2019re welcome. You don\u2019t want to enlist? You\u2019re welcome. You supported the war until just recently? You\u2019re welcome.\u201dPolls in Israel show that the majority now favour a deal that would secure the release of the captives held in Gaza, even if that means an end to the war on Gaza. Nevertheless, the war has continued.\u201cI don\u2019t know if popular pressure\u2019s going to ever stop the war,\u201d said Green. \u201cI mean, its supporters have been in a minority for a year. Refusing [to answer the call up] is our most powerful weapon: no soldiers, no occupation. We need more and more people to refuse.\u201dAll the antiwar activists Al Jazeera spoke to talked of an uptick in interest in their movement following the Israeli government\u2019s unilateral decision in mid-March to collapse the ceasefire it had previously agreed to after months of negotiation.Others spoke of a dramatic increase in support when, after 11 weeks of unremitting siege on Gaza, Israel announced its latest mass ground operation in the devastated Palestinian territory on May 17, intended, according to one Israeli official, to lead to \u201cthe conquest of the Gaza Strip and the holding of the territories\u201d.Before its latest offensive, Israel called up what it said were \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of reservists to bolster its numbers in Gaza.Speaking after the announcement of the latest military attack on Gaza, Israel\u2019s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was clear in what he saw as the aims of the offensive, saying that, within months, Gaza would be \u201ctotally destroyed\u201d and what remains of its pre-war population of more than two million would be exiled to a narrow strip of land along the Egyptian border.However, despite the new offensive to recapture ground already largely destroyed by the Israeli military, dissent is gaining ground.Open letters protesting the war from military units and reservists publicly refusing to turn up for service are becoming more frequent. In April, more than a thousand of Israel\u2019s current and former pilots, generally regarded as an elite unit, wrote an open letter protesting a war they said served the \u201cpolitical and personal interests\u201d of Netanyahu, \u201cand not security ones\u201d.There are no official numbers for how many reservists have not turned up for duty. But, according to Israeli media reports, the number may be as high as 100,000. Those numbers are in addition to those refusing their initial period of mandatory military service.Most of those are \u201cgrey\u201d refusals, activists say. That is, people who gave no political reason for refusing to serve, officially refusing for other reasons, such as declining on medical grounds.But Sofia Orr, a 19-year-old from Pardes Hannah in northern Israel, is one of a growing number of conscripts refusing their mandatory service and making that refusal as public as possible.Orr refused to serve three times after first being called up on February 24, 2024. Her first and second refusals each netted her 20 days in military prison. Her third cost her 45 days.\u201cI\u2019d already decided to refuse when I was 15,\u201d Orr told Al Jazeera. \u201cI asked myself, \u2018If I go and serve in the military, what cause am I serving, does it align with my values, who am I actually helping?\u2019\u201d she said.\u201cIf I enlist, am I just entering the cycle of bloodshed that occupies and bloodily oppresses Palestinians daily?\u201d she said of defying what she described as hardwired societal expectations of Israeli life.\u201cI wanted to challenge that, so it wasn\u2019t just about refusing, but doing so as publicly and loudly as possible. I needed people to see it and know that we exist, that they could do the same, to bring Palestinian suffering into Israeli society and for Palestinians to see it and know they were not alone,\u201d she said.Orr is a member of \u201cMesarvot\u201d, an Israeli organisation that has been supporting conscientious objectors in the face of calls from prominent politicians for refusers to be arrested and prosecuted, including from cabinet member and former Israeli military spokesperson Miri Regev.\u201cThere\u2019s been a steady growth of refusers since October 7,\u201d Nimrod Flaschenberg, a political analyst and spokesperson for Mesarvot said, referring to the 2023 attack on southern Israel that led to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been seeing an exponential increase of 16-, 17-year-olds refusing to serve recently. There are around a hundred circulating an open letter, all refusing service and explaining why.\u201dOf the wider movement, Flaschenberg said, some refused to serve in a war they had come to regard as political, others because they felt it risked the lives of the captives and a minority out of revulsion for the mass killing in Gaza and the West Bank that they were being asked to participate in.\u201cThere\u2019s still an Israeli public taboo over showing any public sympathy for Palestinians,\u201d Flaschenberg said of the low prominence given to Gaza in the reasons given by most refusers, contrasting that with the widespread outrage that greeted ex-General and leader of Israel\u2019s Democrats party, Yair Golan, because he warned that Israel risked becoming regarded as a \u201cpariah state\u201d that killed Palestinian babies \u201cas a hobby\u201d if it didn\u2019t \u201creturn to sanity\u201d.\u201cThat really demonstrates the level of ignorance we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Flaschenberg said. \u201cOf course, Israel is killing babies, but Israelis just can\u2019t accept that.\u201dHowever, while growing international condemnation of Israel concentrates on vilifying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to Orr, it risks overlooking a harsher reality.\u201cFor many people here, it\u2019s Israelis who are the real victims, the first, the last and only victims in all of this,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t even see Palestinians as people, just as a threat.\u201dGreen, who immediately rejoined the protest on the Gaza border after his overnight release from house arrest was over, was equally fatalistic.\u201cI\u2019m not confident we\u2019ll succeed. The government has represented a minority of Israelis for around a year, and the war\u2019s continued,\u201d he said.But, despite that, he was not ready to give up on calling for Israelis to wake up.\u201cThings are already bad enough,\u201d Green added. \u201cWe\u2019ve destroyed nearly every building in Gaza, we\u2019ve killed 18,000 babies, and about 53,000 people. This is something we\u2019re going to have to live with.\u201d\u201cDo we really want to live with any more?\u201d"}

Her injunction is set to last for approximately two weeks, and she set hearing dates on May 27 and 29.Friday\u2019s lawsuit against the Trump administration is Harvard\u2019s second in less than two months.The latest is a response to a decision on Thursday announced by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Her department oversees the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, and she said she is revoking Harvard\u2019s privilege to use the system based on its failure to address Trump administration concerns.\u201cThis administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,\u201d she wrote on social media.The revocation means that Harvard can no longer accept foreign students. Those already enrolled will need to transfer to another school.The move represents a major escalation in Trump\u2019s pressure campaign against Harvard and other top US universities. He has accused schools of allowing anti-Semitism to fester, promoting \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d diversity programmes, and pushing ideological slants.But in Friday\u2019s lawsuit, Harvard called the Trump administration\u2019s actions a \u201cblatant violation\u201d of the US Constitution and other federal laws.Barring the prestigious Ivy League school from enrolling its international students would have an \u201cimmediate and devastating effect\u201d on the university and the more than 7,000 visa holders in its student body, it argued.\u201cWith the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard\u2019s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cWithout its international students, Harvard is not Harvard.\u201dTrump\u2019s current battle against higher education can be largely traced back to the pro-Palestine protests that broke out on US campuses last year, in response to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Trump made cracking down on the antiwar protests a centrepiece of his 2024 re-election campaign.While there have been instances of harassment from participants on both sides of the issue, protest organisers have rejected claims of widespread anti-Jewish sentiment. Some campus protests have even been spearheaded by Jewish students and organisations, including Jewish Voice for Peace.Earlier this year, task forces at Harvard itself issued two reports, warning about instances of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias, as well as anti-Semitism.Harvard has said it is working to address these concerns. Nevertheless, in April, Harvard became the latest school to receive a list of demands from the Trump administration.The list included reforming its hiring and admissions practices, refusing to admit students deemed \u201chostile to the American values and institutions\u201d, doing away with diversity programmes, and auditing academic programmes and centres, including several related to the Middle East.Harvard rejected the demands and immediately faced a freeze in $2.2bn in multi-year grants and $60m in multi-year contracts. Several federal agencies have since frozen tens of millions of dollars more in grants to Harvard.The university responded to Trump\u2019s funding freezes with a lawsuit in April, saying the administration was violating the First Amendment of the US Constitution with its \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d cuts.Trump has also floated revoking Harvard\u2019s tax exempt status, and in April, Noem sent a letter to Harvard first threatening to revoke its Student and Exchange Visitor Program approval if administrators did not send information on any foreign students\u2019 \u201cillegal and violent activities\u201d.At the end of April, Harvard said it had provided all legally required information, without providing further details.Friday\u2019s lawsuit seeks immediate relief from the Trump administration\u2019s decision to de-certify Harvard\u2019s ability to register foreign students, citing \u201cirreparable harm inflicted by this lawless action\u201d.In response to the complaint, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson accused the school of doing too little to address the Trump administration\u2019s concerns.\u201cIf only Harvard cared this much about ending the scourge of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators on their campus, they wouldn\u2019t be in this situation to begin with,\u201d Jackson said.\u201cHarvard should spend their time and resources on creating a safe campus environment instead of filing frivolous lawsuits,\u201d she added.In a letter to the Harvard community, school President Alan Garber framed Trump\u2019s attack on Harvard\u2019s foreign student body as part of \u201ca series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence\u201d.Garber described the de-certification as evidence of the \u201cfederal government\u2019s illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body\u201d.In its complaint, Harvard said the de-certification has thrown \u201ccountless\u201d academic programmes, clinics, courses and research laboratories into disarray.Harvard enrolled nearly 6,800 international students in its current school year, equal to 27 percent of its total enrolment.On Thursday, Noem also said Harvard could avoid the move if it turned over more information on foreign students, including video or audio of their protest activity over the past five years.Harvard has maintained it has already met the legal requirements in its disclosures."}

Since Monday\u2019s announcement, only 300 trucks have made it in, including Thursday\u2019s convoy, according to COGAT.Aid agencies also state that even the aid that is being allowed into Gaza is not reaching people.\u201cSignificant challenges in loading and dispatching goods remain due to insecurity, the risk of looting, delays in coordination approvals and inappropriate routes being provided by Israeli forces that are not viable for the movement of cargo,\u201d the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said.Hamas officials said on Friday that Israeli air strikes had killed at least six Palestinians guarding aid trucks against looters.An umbrella network of Palestinian aid groups said that just 119 aid trucks have entered Gaza since Israel eased its blockade on Monday, and that distribution has been hampered by looting, including by armed groups of men.\u201cThey stole food meant for children and families suffering from severe hunger,\u201d the network said in a statement.The UN\u2019s World Food Programme said on Friday that 15 of its trucks were looted in southern Gaza while en route to WFP-supported bakeries.Inside Gaza, the situation continues to deteriorate.Dr Ahmed al-Farrah of Nasser Hospital told Al Jazeera that the health system is overwhelmed.\u201cMost people now live off food scraps of what they had in stock,\u201d he said. \u201cI predict there will be many victims because of food insecurity.\u201dPalestinian Health Ministry officials said on Thursday that at least 29 children and elderly people have died in recent days from starvation-related causes, with thousands more at risk.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019s  spokesperson said aid is being distributed via UN mechanisms, but stressed the amount reaching Gaza \u201cis not enough\u201d.The leaders of Britain, France and Canada warned Israel on Monday their countries would take action, including possible sanctions, if Israel did not lift aid restrictions.\u201cThe Israeli Government\u2019s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable and risks breaching International Humanitarian Law,\u201d a joint statement released by the British government said.\u201cWe will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions,\u201d it added.In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office accused the trio of being \u201con the wrong side of history\u201d and \u201csupporting \u201cmass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers\u201d."}

Foreign students already enrolled at the college must now transfer to another school or lose their legal status in the US.The government\u2019s move, announced on Thursday, is the latest in escalating tensions between Harvard University and the Trump administration.Here is what we know about the move and its impact.In a letter to Harvard President Alan Garber, Homeland Security Secretary Noem announced that Harvard\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification would be revoked, \u201ceffective immediately\u201d.This means Harvard can no longer enrol any new students on \u201cF-\u201d or \u201cJ-\u201d visas which are typically required to attend a US university as a non-immigrant. Students already at Harvard on these visas will be required to transfer to another school if they want to remain in the US legally.Noem accused the university of \u201cfostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party\u201d.In an earlier letter on April 16, the DHS had threatened to revoke Harvard\u2019s eligibility to enrol international students unless it submits information on international students\u2019 disciplinary records and protest participation.Tensions have been mounting with Harvard since student protests against Israel\u2019s war on Gaza swept campuses last year.The Trump administration accused Harvard of creating an \u201cunsafe and hostile\u201d campus, specifically citing antisemitic incidents and a failure to curb \u201cpro-Hamas activism\u201d. Officials also criticised the university\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies as discriminatory, and raised suspicions over alleged ties to Chinese institutions, though no direct evidence has been made public.In April, the Trump administration froze nearly $2.3bn in federal funding to Harvard over what it claimed was its failure to tackle rampant anti-Semitism on campus.The administration announced the freeze after Harvard rejected a series of demands that it said would subject the university to undue government control, including that it accede to external audits of faculty and students to ensure \u201cviewpoint diversity\u201d. The DHS also demanded detailed records on international students, including any disciplinary actions and potential security concerns.In May, US Education Department Secretary Linda McMahon wrote to Harvard, saying the elite university had made a \u201cmockery\u201d of higher education and should no longer seek federal grants, \u201csince none will be provided\u201d.\u201cHarvard will cease to be a publicly funded institution, and can instead operate as a privately-funded institution, drawing on its colossal endowment, and raising money from its large base of wealthy alumni,\u201d McMahon wrote in the letter.Thursday\u2019s decision to revoke Harvard\u2019s SEVP certification is widely viewed as retaliation for the university\u2019s refusal to fully comply with the federal requests. It is unclear if the Trump administration will reinstate Harvard\u2019s SEVP certification if the university provides the requested information now.The US government has two main ways of barring a university from enrolling international students.First, it can revoke the school\u2019s SEVP certification which allows schools to accept foreign students. Without it, Harvard can no longer issue the Form I-20 document that students need to apply for F-1 or J-1 student visas. This is the step the government took on Thursday.Second, the government can deny student visas outright. The US Department of State reviews visa applications, and if a student says they\u2019re planning to attend a school that doesn\u2019t have SEVP certification \u2013 like Harvard now \u2013 their visa can be denied. That means students would not be allowed to enter the US to study at Harvard, even if they have already been accepted.The move to block enrolment of overseas students affects approximately 6,800 foreign students currently studying at Harvard, constituting about 27 percent of the total student body. These students must now find places to study at other universities in the US or risk having the leave the country.Overseas students at Harvard came from 146 countries as of September 2024. Students from China, Canada and India made up the largest number, collectively accounting for 40 percent of the international cohort.The number of foreign students at the university has risen by 26.75 percent over the past four years.F-1 students usually have 60 days, and J-1 students 30 days, to leave the US after completing their studies. However, if their student status is terminated due to a violation, they may have to leave immediately. In Harvard\u2019s case, it\u2019s unclear how much time international students will be given to transfer or depart.Most international students at Harvard pay full tuition, which is $59,320 for the 2024-25 academic year, either by making direct payments or via scholarships. Room and Board and other mandatory fees amount to an additional $27,606 per student. That makes a total of $86,926 per year.Precise revenue figures for Harvard are not publicly disclosed, but if all 6,800 foreign students are paying full tuition fees and extras, that would amount to just over $591m in annual revenues.International students also have a broader economic impact in the US. They contributed approximately $43.8bn to the US economy during the 2023 \u2013 2024 academic year through tuition and fees and living expenses, according to the NAFSA Association of International Educators.States with the largest economic activity derived from international students were California, New York, Massachusetts, Texas and Illinois.Harvard has pushed back against the DHS decision, calling the move both \u201cunlawful\u201d and \u201cdeeply damaging\u201d to its academic mission.In a public statement, the school said it is fully committed to supporting its global community. \u201cHarvard remains dedicated to supporting our international students and scholars, who contribute immensely to our learning environment,\u201d the statement said.The university\u2019s legal team is reportedly reviewing the implications of the government\u2019s actions and preparing for a possible lawsuit if the certification is not reinstated.In the meantime, Harvard has set up dedicated advisory resources to help students understand their rights and explore transfer options."}

Both were pronounced dead at the scene.Israeli embassy staff have said that the young couple were set to be engaged in the coming days.\u201cA young couple \u2014 at the beginning of their life\u2019s journey, about to be engaged, in another country \u2014 had their bodies removed in the cold of the night, in a foreign city, in a body bag. We are not going to tolerate that anymore,\u201d said Pirro, appearing to allude primarily to Lischinsky\u2019s foreign roots.\u201cThis is the kind of case that picks at old sores and old scars, because these kinds of cases remind us of what has happened in the past that we can never and must never forget.\u201dShe pointed out that the Wednesday night attack took place at a museum that includes one of Washington\u2019s oldest synagogues in the centre of the city.Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said that the suspect chanted, \u201cFree Palestine! Free Palestine!\u201d after the shooting. Rodriguez, who hailed from Chicago, appears to have identified himself to police and was arrested shortly after the shooting.An affidavit from the Federal Bureau of Investigation notes that Rodriguez told police, \u201cI did it for Palestine. I did it for Gaza.\u201dThe shooting, which has been widely condemned, comes as Israel faces growing global anger over its war on Gaza, where a blockade has left millions of Palestinians without food or basic supplies.Experts at human rights organisations and the United Nations have compared the war, which has killed at least 53,000 people, to ethnic cleansing and genocide.Since the war began on October 7, 2023, Jewish, Muslim and Arab communities have all reported upticks in harassment and racism.In the aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s shooting, officials spoke out against anti-Semitism, and the administration of President Donald Trump promised to pursue every legal avenue against the suspect.\u201cThe Department of Justice will be prosecuting the perpetrator responsible for this to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday. \u201cHatred has no place in the United States of America under President Donald Trump.\u201dShe went on to compare antiwar protests at US universities, which have been largely peaceful, to \u201c\u200aanti-Semitic illegal behaviour\u201d. Protest leaders, however, have largely disavowed anti-Jewish hate.In the wake of the shooting, one US Congress member told Fox News that the \u201cPalestinian cause\u201d was \u201cevil\u201d. Republican Representative Randy Fine continued by suggesting the Gaza war should end like World War II did, with the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.\u201cWe nuked the Japanese twice in order to get unconditional surrender,\u201d he said. \u201cThat needs to be the same here. There is something deeply, deeply wrong with this culture, and it needs to be defeated.\u201dSeparately, the Israeli government denounced the shooting as an attack against its state.\u201cWe are witness to the terrible cost of the antisemitism and wild incitement against the State of Israel,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement."}

He accuses Harvard of \u201cpushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting \u2018Sickness\u2019\u201d.April 16, 2025: The Department of Homeland Security calls on Harvard to turn over records on any foreign students\u2019 \u201cillegal and violent activities\u201d, while threatening to revoke the university\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor Program approval. The certification is required for it to enrol foreign students.

No action is immediately taken.May 5, 2025: The Trump administration says it is cutting all new federal grants to Harvard.May 13, 2025: The US Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announces another $450m in federal funding from eight federal agencies.May 19, 2025: The DOJ announces it will use the False Claims Act, typically used to punish federal funding recipients accused of corruption, to crack down on universities like Harvard over DEI policies. The Department of Health and Human Services also says it is terminating $60m in federal grants to Harvard.May 22, 2025: Noem announces revocation of Harvard\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor Program, blocking it from enrolling new foreign students and saying current students will need to transfer to continue their studies.Harvard responds: \u201cWe are fully committed to maintaining Harvard\u2019s ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the university \u2013 and this nation \u2013 immeasurably.\u201d"}
{"website": "aljazeera", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/22/israeli-speculation-mounts-over-potential-rift-between-trump-and-netanyahu", "title": "Israeli speculation mounts over potential rift between Trump and Netanyahu", "date": "22 May 2025", "media_type": "news", "link": null, "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has often tried to paint himself as a close friend of United States President Donald Trump, but the relationship has rarely been as straightforward as the Israeli premier has portrayed it.And recently, speculation across the Israeli media that the relationship between the two leaders, and by extension, their countries, has begun to unravel is becoming unavoidable.Some idea of the gap was apparent in Trump\u2019s recent Middle East trip, which saw him visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates but not Israel, the state that has typically been the US\u2019s closest ally within the region.Likewise, US negotiations with two of Israel\u2019s fiercest regional opponents, Iran and the Houthi rebels in Yemen, have been taking place without any apparent input from Israel, a country that has always regarded itself as central to such matters. Lastly, against a growing chorus of international condemnation over Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, there was the decision of US Vice President JD Vance to cancel a planned visit to Israel for apparently \u201clogistical\u201d reasons.Appearing on national television earlier this month, Israeli commentator Dana Fahn Luzon put it succinctly: \u201cTrump is signalling to Netanyahu, \u2018Honey, I\u2019ve had enough of you.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a total breakdown of everything that might be of benefit to Israel,\u201d Mitchell Barak, an Israeli pollster and former political aide to several senior Israeli political figures, including Netanyahu, told Al Jazeera. \u201cAmerica was once our closest ally; now we don\u2019t seem to have a seat at the table. This should be of concern to every single Israeli.\u201d\u2018Many Israelis blame Netanyahu for this,\u201d Barak continued. \u201cHe always presented Trump as somehow being in his pocket, and it\u2019s pretty clear Trump didn\u2019t like that. Netanyahu crossed a line.\u201dWhile concern over a potential rift may be growing within Israel, prominent voices in the US administration are stressing the strength of their alliance.Last Sunday, President Trump\u2019s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said that, while the US was keen to avert what he called a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d in Gaza, he didn\u2019t think there was \u201cany daylight between President Trump\u2019s position and Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s position\u201d.Also doubling down on the US\u2019s commitment to Israel was White House National Security Council spokesperson James Hewitt, who dismissed reports that the Trump administration was preparing to \u201cabandon\u201d Israel if it continues with its war on Gaza, telling Israeli media that \u201cIsrael has had no better friend in its history than President Trump\u201d.The Trump administration has also been active in shutting down criticism of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza in public spheres and specifically on US college campuses.Several international students have also been arrested and deported for their support of Palestine, including Rumeysa Ozturk, whose arrest as she was walking on a street in a Boston suburb for an opinion piece co-authored in a student newspaper was described by Human Rights Watch as \u201cchilling\u201d.Those policies have made it clear that the Trump administration sits firmly in Israel\u2019s corner. And looking back at Trump\u2019s policies in his first presidential term, that is not surprising.Trump fulfilled many of the Israeli right\u2019s dreams in that term, between 2017 and 2021, including recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, despite its eastern half being occupied Palestinian territory, recognising the annexation of the Golan Heights, despite it being occupied Syrian territory, and pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal.But those actions are partly to blame for the bumpy relationship between Trump and Netanyahu, with the US president reportedly resentful of what he saw as a lack of gratitude for those pro-Israel policies.Trump was also furious after Netanyahu congratulated former US President Joe Biden following his 2020 election victory over Trump, which the current president still disputes.\u201cThe first person that congratulated [Biden] was Bibi [Benjamin] Netanyahu, the man that I did more for than any other person I dealt with. \u2026 Bibi could have stayed quiet. He has made a terrible mistake,\u201d Trump said in an interview in 2021.Nevertheless, in the build-up to the 2024 US election, Netanyahu and his allies actively courted candidate Trump, believing him to be the best means of fulfilling their agenda and continuing their war on Gaza, analysts said.\u201cNetanyahu had really campaigned for Trump before the election, emphasising how bad Biden was,\u201d Yossi Mekelberg, an Associate Fellow at Chatham House, said.\u201cNow they don\u2019t know which way Trump\u2019s going to go because he\u2019s so contractual. He\u2019s all about the win,\u201d Mekelberg added, referring to the series of victories the president claimed during his recent Gulf tour, adding, \u201cbut there\u2019s no win in Palestine\u201d.Across the Israeli press and media, a consensus is taking hold that Trump has simply tired of trying to secure a \u201cwin\u201d or an end to the war on Gaza that Netanyahu and his allies on the Israeli hard right have no interest in pursuing.Israeli Army Radio has even carried reports that Trump has blocked direct contact from Netanyahu over concerns that the Israeli prime minister may be trying to manipulate him.Quoting an unnamed Israeli official, Yanir Cozin, a reporter with Israeli Army Radio, wrote on X: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing Trump hates more than being portrayed as a sucker and someone being played, so he decided to cut off contact.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a sense in Israel that Trump\u2019s turned on Netanyahu,\u201d political analyst Nimrod Flaschenberg said from Tel Aviv. \u201cSupporters of Netanyahu are panicking, as they all previously thought that Trump\u2019s backing was unlimited.\u201dA break in relations between Netanyahu and Trump might not mean an automatic break between Israel and the US, Flaschenberg cautioned, with all factions across the Israeli political spectrum speculating on what the future may hold under a realigned relationship with the US.US financial, military and diplomatic support for Israel has been a bedrock of both countries\u2019 foreign policy for decades, Mekelberg said. Moreover, whatever Trump\u2019s current misgivings about his relationship with Netanyahu, support for Israel, while diminishing, remains hardwired into much of his Republican base, analysts and polls have noted, and particularly among Republican \u2013 and Democratic \u2013 donors.\u201cThose opposed to Netanyahu and the war are hoping that the US may now apply a lasting ceasefire,\u201d Flaschenberg said, with reference to Israeli reliance upon US patronage. \u201cThat\u2019s not because of any great faith in Trump, but more the extent of their dismay in the current government.\u201dHowever, equally present are those on the hard right, such as Israel\u2019s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who Mekelberg speculated may also hope to take advantage of whatever direction US policy towards Israel heads in.\u201cBen-Gvir, Smotrich and their backers could take advantage of American disinterest, depending upon what shape it takes,\u201d Mekelberg told Al Jazeera. \u201cIf the US continues to provide weapons and diplomatic cover in the UN while letting [Israel] get on with it, then that\u2019s their dream,\u201d he said of Smotrich, who has reassured his backers that allowing minimal aid into the besieged enclave did not mean that Israel would stop \u201cdestroying everything that\u2019s left of the Gaza Strip\u201d.However, where Netanyahu may figure in this is uncertain.Accusations that the Israeli prime minister has become reliant upon the war to sustain the political coalition he needs to remain in office and avoid both a legal reckoning in his corruption trial, as well as a political reckoning over his government\u2019s failures ahead of the October 7, 2023 attack, are both widespread and longstanding.\u201cI don\u2019t know if Netanyahu can come back from this,\u201d Barak said, still uncertain about whether the prime minister can demonstrate his survival skills once again. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Netanyahu being at the end of his line. I don\u2019t know. They\u2019ve been saying that for years, and he\u2019s still here. They were saying that when I was his aide, but I can\u2019t see any more magic tricks that are available to him.\u201d"}

It refused.\u201dIn a letter to the university\u2019s administration, Noem said the university\u2019s Student Exchange Visitor Program certification has been revoked. The programme is overseen by the US Homeland Security Investigations unit, which falls under the agency Noem leads.The move means that not only will Harvard not be able to accept foreign students on its campus, but current students will need to \u201ctransfer to another university in order to maintain their non-immigrant status\u201d, the letter said.In a statement, Harvard called the move \u201cunlawful\u201d and a \u201cretaliatory action\u201d.\u201cWe are fully committed to maintaining Harvard\u2019s ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the university \u2013 and this nation \u2013 immeasurably,\u201d the university said.The action marks an escalation amid a wider standoff between the university \u2013 which has refused to agree to a list of demands related to its diversity programmes and response to pro-Palestine protests \u2013 and the Trump administration.The administration has responded with three rounds of federal funding and grant cuts, totalling more than $2.6bn. The most recent was on Monday. Harvard is currently pursuing a lawsuit accusing the administration of defying the US Constitution in its actions.Earlier this week, Harvard President Alan Garber called on alumni to throw their support \u2013 and donations \u2013 behind the university.\u201cThe institution entrusted to us now faces challenges unlike any others in our long history,\u201d Garber wrote in an email, in which he launched the Presidential Priorities Fund and the Presidential Fund for Research. Both funds are meant to address gaps left by the funding cuts.According to immigration lawyer Leon Fresco, the move by the Trump administration would be a financial blow for the school and a \u201cmajor problem\u201d for the students.\u201cIf the foreign students cannot attend the university, they get their tuition payments back that they\u2019ve already paid to the university for this upcoming semester,\u201d he told Al Jazeera, adding that Harvard was relying on that money for the coming year.Fresco noted that there is a clear legal recourse to fight against the revocation of its foreign exchange programme.\u201cThe revocation regulation is very specific \u2013 there has to be a notice of intention to revoke that is given. There has to be reasons related to non-compliance with the student exchange visitor program,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a politically ideologically based revocation, that doesn\u2019t exist in the regulations.\u201dNoem, in April, first threatened to revoke Harvard\u2019s Student Exchange Visitor Program certification, which is required by educational institutions to host students on several visa types.She gave the university administration an April 30 deadline to provide detailed records on what she called the \u201cillegal and violent activities\u201d of foreign students on campus, pointing to a federal law that requires disclosures of academics, enrolment and disciplinary action.The university later said it had provided the requested information to the agency, the Harvard Crimson reported, although it did not reveal further details.The threat came amid a wider crackdown by the Trump administration on pro-Palestine protests at universities across the US, which federal officials have broadly portrayed as \u201canti-Semitic\u201d, a label rejected by organisers,  Al Jazeera\u2019s Kimberly Halkett reported.\u201cThe Trump administration has been clamping down hard on Harvard and other colleges, including Columbia University, over what the administration says is \u2018anti-Semitism\u2019 that exists on the campuses, and that really seems to be the spark that kind of ignited this,\u201d Halkett reported from Washington, DC.\u201cThe president put in place a joint task force at the start of his administration to address this, but opponents say this task force evolved to include everything from clamping down on hiring practices to curriculum changes at universities,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump himself has accused universities of fomenting \u2018anti-Trump\u2019 ideology.\u201dThere were 7,417 total schools approved for the Student Exchange Visitor Program in the US in 2023, according to federal data. The agency maintains that under federal law, it can review approved schools at any time."}

The violations in question, Van Der Hout said, include the lack of a warrant at the time of the arrest and claims that Khalil proved to be a flight risk.The hearing could be the most consequential turn yet in a series of cases in which US students have challenged being targeted by the Trump administration for their pro-Palestine advocacy or statements. It comes after three other students \u2013 Rumeysa Ozturk, Mohsen Mahdawi, and Badar Khan Suri \u2013 successfully challenged their detentions.Ozturk, Mahdawi, and Khan Suri have since been ordered released on bail as their parallel challenges in federal court and their deportation cases in immigration court proceed. Lawyers for the students say their rights, including freedom of speech, have been violated by the Trump administration.Despite Khalil also challenging his arrest in a federal case in New Jersey, a judge there has yet to make a ruling on whether he should be released. He has remained in detention in Louisiana.Khalil\u2019s lawyers have accused the Trump administration of trying to slow roll his federal challenge to his arrest and detention, while fast-tracking the immigration proceedings. Judges in immigration courts, which fall under the executive branch, are typically viewed as less independent than life-tenured federal district judges.\u201cThe bigger picture is that the government would like to slow down Mahmoud\u2019s habeas corpus case in federal court before an independent judge who has life tenure,\u201d Ramzi Kassem, a lawyer with the City University of New York\u2019s Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility (CLEAR) project, told reporters.\u201cAnd they\u2019d like to accelerate as much as possible these immigration proceedings, as they have so far, in front of a government employee who is subject to government pressure,\u201d he said.Immigration Judge Jamee Comans had previously sided with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s claim that Khalil is deportable under an obscure provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act because his presence in the US poses \u201cadverse foreign policy consequences\u201d.Rubio has broadly portrayed Khalil\u2019s involvement in pro-Palestine protests at Columbia University as \u201canti-Semitic\u201d, but has not provided any further evidence to the court supporting the claim.Khalil and his legal team have firmly denied that his advocacy contained any anti-Jewish sentiment, and no evidence of such conduct has emerged.Thursday\u2019s hearing not hinge on the government\u2019s motivation for targeting Khalil, but instead focus on procedural missteps by immigration agents.Those agents had initially claimed that they had a warrant to detain Khalil when they confronted him in the lobby of his Manhattan apartment building. They later admitted they did not have a warrant, but arrested Khalil because they said his actions and statements indicated he was a flight risk.Surveillance footage of the encounter contradicts that statement, Khalil\u2019s lawyers maintain.\u201cWe filed, over the last probably 48 hours, new evidence, including a video surveillance from Columbia that we got through a subpoena that clearly shows there was no attempt to flee whatsoever,\u201d Van Der Hout said.Lawyers for Khalil also separately argued that he is eligible for asylum. They say the unfounded claims made by the Trump administration that Khalil is a \u201cHamas supporter\u201d would put him at risk if he were to be deported to his birthplace of Syria, or to Algeria, where he has citizenship.Ahead of the hearing, officials from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) denied a meeting between Khalil, his wife, Noor Abdalla, and their son, who was born while Khalil remained in detention.A federal judge later ordered that Khalil must be allowed an in-person meeting with his wife, with Khalil holding his son for the first time on Thursday."}

More essential food is needed to push back the risk of famine. Bread alone is not enough for people to survive,\u201d the agency said in a post on X. The president of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), Younis al-Khatib, had earlier said many Palestinians had yet to receive any supplies so far. \u201cNo civilian has received anything yet,\u201d al-Khatib told reporters.He said most of the aid trucks are still at the Karem Abu Salem crossing, known as Kerem Shalom to Israelis, in southern Gaza.As limited deliveries enter the Strip, the Israeli military has continued to launch attacks across the enclave, with medical sources telling Al Jazeera that at least 51 Palestinians have been killed since dawn on Thursday.At least 53,655 Palestinians have been killed and more than 121,000 others injured since Israel\u2019s war on Gaza began in October 2023, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee also announced new forced evacuation orders for Palestinians in Jabalia and Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza. He said in a post on X that the army will \u201csignificantly expand its military activity\u201d in the area.Reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum said that while Palestinians have welcomed the influx of aid, it is a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d compared with the population\u2019s needs.\u201cFive hundred aid trucks are needed on a daily basis in order to avert the current food crisis in the territory,\u201d Abu Azzoum explained.Still, Gaza resident Ahmed Abed al-Daym said the aid trucks were a \u201cpositive sign\u201d amid dire conditions.\u201cOur homes are empty \u2013 there is no bread, and our children are going hungry,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\u201cIn many households, bread has completely disappeared. What people urgently need is a steady and sufficient flow of flour and other essentials. Unfortunately, the limited aid that has entered so far falls far short of meeting our needs.\u201dAnother resident, Reem Zidiah, said that due to the mass starvation that Gaza is enduring, no one is safe in the besieged enclave.\u201cAll of us here in Gaza, we don\u2019t think about tomorrow because we don\u2019t know what will happen tomorrow \u2013 whether we\u2019re going to live or die,\u201d Zidiah told Al Jazeera.Meanwhile, Action Against Hunger teams on the ground in southern Gaza warned that there was less than a seven-days\u2019 supply of food to prevent acute malnutrition in children.Natalia Anguera, the humanitarian group\u2019s head of Middle East operations, said \u201cflour has come in and some bakeries in the south have resumed operations\u201d.However, she stressed that \u201cspecific nutritional supplies reserves for children under five are about to run out\u201d."}

At least 53,655 have been killed since Israel launched its assault on Gaza in October 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities."}

On Thursday, he appeared in court in Washington, DC, for his arraignment. A preliminary hearing has been set for June 18. Rodriguez is the only suspect.President Donald Trump condemned the shooting as \u201chorrible\u201d, stating there was no place for \u201chatred\u201d in the US. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by what had unfolded in the US capital.\u201cThis is a despicable act of hatred, of anti-Semitism, which has claimed the lives of two young employees of the Israeli embassy,\u201d he said.Kristi Noem, secretary of Homeland Security, said federal authorities were investigating the incident and would bring its \u201cdepraved perpetrator\u201d to justice. Jeanine Pirro, the interim US attorney for Washington, DC, said the killings were being investigated as a \u201chate crime and a crime of terrorism\u201d.Here is what we know so far:Officers responded to multiple calls about a shooting near the Capital Jewish Museum at about 9pm on Wednesday (01:00 GMT Thursday).The victims, a man and a woman, were leaving an event at the museum, which is in the area of 3rd and F streets in Northwest, Washington, DC, close to an FBI field office and the US attorney general\u2019s office, when the suspect approached a group of four people and opened fire, Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said at a news conference.First responders found the victims unconscious and not breathing. Despite life-saving efforts, both were pronounced dead.According to police, the suspect entered the museum after the shooting and was detained by security personnel at the event.\u201cOnce in handcuffs, the suspect identified where he discarded the weapon, and that weapon has been recovered, and he implied that he committed the offence,\u201d Smith said.The two were named by the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim.Lischinsky was Israeli. A German diplomatic source told the AFP news agency that Lischinsky also held a German passport.Milgrim was an American citizen. Both worked at the Israeli embassy.The Israeli ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, told reporters the young staffers were a couple \u201cabout to be engaged\u201d.\u201cThe young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem,\u201d Leiter revealed.The suspect has been identified as 31-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, Illinois. Following his arrest, his home was searched by police.Rodriguez has been charged with two counts of murder, causing death with a firearm and discharging a firearm in a crime of violence.Jeanine Pirro, the interim US Attorney who was recently appointed by President Donald Trump as federal prosecutor in Washington, told reporters the charges against Ridriguez constitute a \u201cdeath penalty-eligible case\u201d.\u201cWe are going to continue to investigate this as a hate crime and as a crime of terrorism,\u201d Pirro said.Reporting from close to the site of the shooting, Al Jazeera\u2019s Heidi Zhou-Castro said the suspect was not previously on the radar of local authorities.\u201cHe was not a known entity. There was no heightened alert prior to this happening,\u201d she said.So far, the police have not confirmed any motive.Speaking on Thursday, Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, blamed a \u201ctoxic anti-Semitic incitement against Israel and Jews around the world\u201d since the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023.When the suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was taken into custody, he began chanting: \u201cFree, free Palestine,\u201d Police Chief Smith said.Mohamad Elmasry, professor of media studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, said the attacks were \u201cawful\u201d and were rightfully being condemned regardless of political ideology.He said: \u201cYou have the Trump administration, Israel and some of their supporters coming out and saying that this is an act of anti-Semitism \u2026 and that could be the case, that it is just an act of naked anti-Jewish hatred, which obviously should be condemned,\u201d Elmasry told Al Jazeera.\u201cBut it\u2019s also possible that Mr Rodriguez carried this act of vigilante violence out against the State of Israel, or that he\u2019s taking out his frustrations over the genocide [in Gaza] or Israel\u2019s apartheid policies, on these embassy staffers. That\u2019s an important distinction, because if that\u2019s the motive, then it requires a different course of action.\u201d\u201cThese horrible DC killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW!\u201d President Trump posted on social media early Thursday.\u201cHatred and radicalism have no place in the USA. Condolences to the families of the victims. So sad that such things as this can happen! God bless you all!\u201dLater, Trump\u2019s Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated the president\u2019s outrage and warned of dire consequences.\u201cThe evil of anti-Semitism must be eradicated from our society,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Department of Justice will be prosecuting the perpetrator responsible for this to the fullest extent of the law.\u201dShe also tied the shooting to Trump\u2019s crackdown on anti-Semitism, which has largely focused on antiwar student protesters demonstrating against Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.\u201cSecretary of State Marco Rubio has revoked thousands of student visas from campuses where these pro-Hamas terrorist campus agitators and violent protests took place,\u201d Leavitt explained.\u201cWe\u2019ve also withheld funding from those varied campuses as well in an effort to combat anti-Semitism. So the president has made it very clear that such hatred will have no place in our country.\u201dIsraeli officials also strongly condemned the incident, describing it as a \u201cdespicable act of hatred\u201d. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after the shooting: \u201cWe are witnessing the terrible price of anti-Semitism and the wild incitement against the State of Israel.\u201cI have instructed to enhance security arrangements at Israeli missions around the world and to increase protection for state representatives,\u201d Netanyahu said.On Thursday, reactions and condolences poured in from other countries as well.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called the shooting a \u201cheinous act\u201d in a post on X, adding that at the moment \u201cwe must assume there was an anti-Semitic motive\u201d.Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, said: \u201cShocked by the shooting of two Israeli embassy staff in Washington DC. There is and should be no place in our societies for hatred, extremism, or antisemitism. I extend my condolences to the families of the victims and the people of Israel.\u201dIn the United Kingdom, Foreign Secretary of State David Lammy said: \u201cHorrified by the killing of two Israeli Embassy staff in DC. We condemn this appalling, antisemitic crime. Our thoughts are with the victims, their families and colleagues at this awful time.\u201dFrance\u2019s foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: \u201cThe murder of two members of the Israeli embassy near the Jewish Museum in Washington is an abhorrent act of antisemitic barbarity. Nothing can justify such violence. My thoughts go to their loved ones, their colleagues, and the State of Israel.\u201dIn Ireland, the prime minister, Micheal Martin, said: \u201cI strongly condemn the horrific gun attack that killed two Israeli embassy staff in Washington DC last night. My deepest sympathies go to the family and friends of the couple, and the Israeli people. There can be absolutely no place for violence or hate.\u201dAntonio Tajani, the Italian foreign minister, said: \u201cI stand with the State of Israel for the tragic murder of two young employees of the Israeli embassy in Washington. Scenes of terror and violence to be strongly condemned. antisemitism born of hatred against Jews must be stopped, the horrors of the past can never return.\u201dOn Thursday, federal prosecutors announced an opening volley of charges against the suspect, Rodriguez, with promises to potentially unveil more.Rodriguez was charged with first-degree murder, murdering foreign officials, causing death with a firearm and discharging a firearm in a crime of violence.Pirro, a former Fox News host whom Trump only recently appointed as the interim US attorney for the District of Columbia, said that Rodriguez could face further charges in coming days.\u201cThis is a horrific crime, and these crimes are not going to be tolerated by me and by this office,\u201d Pirro said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to investigate this as a hate crime and a crime of terrorism, and we will add additional charges as the evidence warrants.\u201dInvestigations continue into Rodriguez\u2019s background and motives. Police cordoned off his home in Chicago, Illinois, as their probe continues.Police Chief Smith said law enforcement did not believe there was an ongoing threat to the community at present.FBI Director Kash Patel said he and his team had been briefed on the shooting.\u201cWhile we\u2019re working with [the Metropolitan Police Department] to respond and learn more, in the immediate, please pray for the victims and their families,\u201d he wrote on X.Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters her administration would not tolerate \u201cviolence or hate in our city\u201d.\u201cWe will not tolerate any acts of terrorism, and we\u2019re going to stand together as a community in the coming days and weeks to send a clear message that we will not tolerate anti-Semitism,\u201d Bowser said.Across the Atlantic, in France, the country\u2019s interior minister told police to \u201cstep up surveillance at sites linked to the Jewish community\u201d. Security measures must be \u201cvisible and dissuasive\u201d, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said in a message seen by AFP news agency.Saar said that Israeli flags at the ministry headquarters and at missions around the world would be flown at half-mast on Thursday.The shooting comes as Israel has launched a new military campaign in Gaza to control all of the Strip while continuing to impose an 11-week aid blockade that has been widely condemned.Many world leaders, including allies, have demanded that Israel end the war and let aid into the war-ravaged territory or face punitive actions."}

The main products imported from the UK included machinery such as jet engines, electrical equipment, pharmaceuticals and vehicles.Conversely, the UK was Israel\u2019s eighth largest export destination, receiving Israeli exports valued at about $1.57bn, primarily of diamonds, chemical products, machinery and electronics.Israel\u2019s global trade in 2024 consisted of $91.5bn in imports and $61.7bn in exports.Some of Israel\u2019s top imports include:Some of Israel\u2019s top exports include:Israel\u2019s electronics sector is a key engine of its export economy, led by significant players like Intel, which runs large-scale chip fabrication facilities, as well as companies such as Elbit Systems and Orbotech, known for their expertise in military electronics and advanced manufacturing.Israel is a major exporter of pharmaceuticals, driven by companies such as Teva Pharmaceuticals, one of the world\u2019s largest generic drug manufacturers.Israel is also a global leader in the diamond trade, importing billions of dollars worth of rough diamonds which are then cut, polished and processed domestically before being exported.Israel sold $61.7bn worth of goods in 2024. The biggest importers of Israeli products were the United States with $17.3bn, Ireland with $3.2bn and China with $2.8bn.

We expect a full investigation and we expect an immediate explanation of what happened. It\u2019s totally unacceptable, it\u2019s some of many things that are totally unacceptable that\u2019s going on in the region.We demand the launch of a full investigation so that similar incidents do not happen again.Today\u2019s events in Jenin are unacceptable. I have spoken to our diplomats who were affected. Civilians must always be protected, and diplomats allowed to do their jobs. There must be a full investigation, and those responsible should be held accountable.I am deeply shocked and horrified that the [Israeli forces] today opened fire on a group of diplomats visiting the town of Jenin. Thankfully, nobody was killed or injured.I unreservedly condemn this aggressive, intimidatory and violent act. This is not and must never be a normal way to behave.We ask the government of Israel to immediately clarify what happened. The threats against diplomats are unacceptable.Diplomats should be able to do their work, and threatening them is unacceptable. I have called the Dutch representative in the Palestinian territories and our ambassador to Israel and am relieved that the delegation is unharmed. We condemn the shooting, have requested clarification from the Israeli authorities and are considering further steps.A visit to Jenin, in which one of our diplomats was participating, was fired upon by Israeli soldiers. This is unacceptable. The Israeli ambassador will be summoned to explain. Full support to our agents on site and their remarkable work in trying conditions.This is a very serious and condemnable incident. I have spoken with the Finnish diplomat who was present at the situation. We demand an explanation from Israel about the situation.It is unacceptable that Israel has fired shots near foreign diplomats. It has no place anywhere and is completely unacceptable.The Danish head of mission in Ramallah was among the diplomats and is fortunately safe. In light of the seriousness of the situation, I have asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to summon the Israeli ambassador so that we can get an official explanation.I was shocked to learn that the Israeli army opened fire on 20 diplomats today, including a Belgian colleague. Fortunately, he is fine. These diplomats were on an official visit to Jenin, coordinated with the Israeli army, in a convoy of 20 clearly recognisable vehicles. Belgium is asking Israel for a convincing explanation.I condemn the attacks by [the Israeli military] against a group of diplomats in Jenin today. Diplomatic and consular staff enjoy a special status under international law and must be protected. These actions constitute a clear violation of international law and are deeply unacceptable.Portugal condemns the attack by the Israeli army on the diplomatic delegation in the Jenin refugee camp, West Bank. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs \u2026 expressed its solidarity with the Portuguese ambassador who was part of the delegation and will take the appropriate diplomatic measures.The Federal Foreign Office strongly condemns this unprovoked fire. We can count ourselves lucky that nothing more serious occurred.The group was travelling in the West Bank in the course of its diplomatic work and in coordination with the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli army. The role of diplomats as independent observers on the ground is indispensable and in no way represents a threat to Israeli security interests.The Israeli government must immediately investigate the circumstances and respect the inviolability of diplomats.Slovenia joins EU partners in condemning the gunfire that threatened foreign diplomats at Jenin camp.Such intimidation violates the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations and is utterly unacceptable. We expect a prompt, transparent Israeli investigation, full accountability and guarantees of safe, unhindered access for all diplomatic missions.This is a clear violation of international law and international humanitarian law, and a crime that contravenes all diplomatic norms.The Ministry\u2019s official spokesperson, Ambassador Dr Sufyan Qudah, affirmed the kingdom\u2019s absolute rejection and strong condemnation of this targeting, which constitutes a violation of diplomatic agreements and norms, particularly the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which defines the procedures and controls governing diplomatic work and grants immunities to diplomatic missions.The state of Qatar strongly condemns the Israeli occupation forces for opening fire on an international diplomatic delegation during its visit to the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, and considered as a violation of international laws, conventions, and diplomatic norms.We condemn in the strongest terms the opening of fire by Israeli soldiers on a group of diplomats, including an official from the Turkish Consulate General in Jerusalem, during their visit to the city of Jenin.This attack, which endangered the lives of diplomats, is yet another demonstration of Israel\u2019s systematic disregard for international law and human rights. The targeting of diplomats constitutes a grave threat not only to individual safety but also to the mutual respect and trust that form the foundation of inter-state relations.The Arab Republic of Egypt emphasises its absolute rejection of this incident, which violates all diplomatic norms, and calls upon the Israeli side to provide the necessary clarifications regarding the circumstances of this incident.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has summoned the Israeli ambassador in Montevideo to clarify the incident.Uruguay urges the Israeli government to investigate this incident and take the necessary measures to ensure the protection and allow the operations of diplomatic personnel accredited to the State of Palestine.The Israeli military justified the action by stating that the diplomatic delegation had invaded an \u2018unauthorised area\u2019. However, there is no record of this occurring or of any officer approaching the delegation to verbally warn them in a timely manner.What happened violates the provisions of Article 29 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which establishes the inviolability of diplomatic agents. All States Parties to the aforementioned Convention, including Israel, are obliged to respect it.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will request the Israeli embassy in Mexico to provide the clarifications warranted by the case."}

This is the first time Trump\u2019s plan has been mentioned by Netanyahu as one of the conditions to halt fighting. Multiple nations and rights groups have called the plan ethnic cleansing.Netanyahu said Israel should avoid a \u201chumanitarian crisis to preserve our freedom of operational action\u201d, referring to Israel\u2019s decision to allow a very limited number of humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza. He also referenced a much-criticised plan \u201cdeveloped with the US\u201d to distribute food in the enclave without Hamas taking control of it. The Palestinian group denies it takes aid. Israel has come under international pressure to halt its punishing total blockade on Gaza, which had prevented any food or aid trucks from entering the territory since March 2.That has exacerbated the already dire humanitarian catastrophe inside the enclave. A United Nations-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification assessment found more than 93 percent of children in Gaza, or about 930,000, are on the brink of famine.On Wednesday, the Israeli army said it allowed 100 aid trucks carrying flour, baby food and medical equipment into Gaza. Yet UN officials said distribution problems had meant no aid had so far reached people in need.\u201cThe limited supplies finally being allowed to enter Kerem Shalom [in Arabic, the Karem Abu Salem border crossing] are nowhere near enough to meet the needs in Gaza, which are vast, which are tremendous. Much, much more aid needs to get in,\u201d said Stephane Dujarric, the UN chief\u2019s spokesperson.Aid groups have said the amount of aid that Israel is allowing is not nearly enough, calling Netanyahu\u2019s efforts a \u201csmokescreen to pretend the siege is over\u201d.\u201cThe Israeli authorities\u2019 decision to allow a ridiculously inadequate amount of aid into Gaza after months of an air-tight siege signals their intention to avoid the accusation of starving people in Gaza while, in fact, keeping them barely surviving,\u201d said Pascale Coissard, the emergency coordinator in Khan Younis for Doctors Without Borders.Critics were swift in reacting to Netanyahu\u2019s news conference. His \u201cwords today mean the occupation of Gaza for many years and waking up every day to the death of soldiers\u201d, opposition leader Yair Lapid said, adding that the country\u2019s international standing would collapse and the economy would be severely damaged.\u201cI saw a presentation by a pressured, obsessed, lying man who takes no responsibility for anything,\u201d the Democrats party leader Yair Golan said after the news conference. \u201cI will sue you for defamation because of the lies you spread about me, and we will defeat you in the elections very soon and send you to the pages of history.\u201dNetanyahu had slammed Golan on Tuesday after the opposition leader had said, \u201cA sane country \u2026 does not kill babies as a hobby.\u201d Netanyahu called the comment \u201cappalling\u201d."}

The band says they have been targets of a smear campaign for calling out Israel\u2019s genocidal war.KNEECAP STATEMENT:Since our statements at Coachella \u2014 exposing the ongoing genocide against the Palestinian people \u2014 we have faced a coordinated smear campaign.For over a year, we have used our shows to call out the British and Irish governments' complicity in war crimes.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/mBojb5QBOP\u2014 KNEECAP (@KNEECAPCEOL) April 25, 2025The Belfast trio is also well known for its political and satirical lyrics and use of symbolism associated with the Irish Republican movement, which seeks to unite Northern Ireland, currently part of the UK, with the Republic of Ireland.More than 3,600 people were killed during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland during \u201cThe Troubles\u201d involving the Irish Republican Army (IRA), pro-British Loyalist militias and the UK security forces.Kneecap takes its name from a brutal punishment, which involved being shot in the kneecaps, that was meted out by paramilitary groups to informers and drug dealers.The band has been praised for invigorating the Irish-language cultural scene in Northern Ireland, where the status of the language remains a contested political issue in a society still split between Protestant British Unionists and Catholic Irish Nationalist communities.It has also been criticised for lyrics laden with expletives and drug references.Kneecap came under intense scrutiny and criticism last month during their performance at the music festival Coachella in California when they projected the words \u201cF*** Israel. Free Palestine.\u201d on stage.\u201cThe Irish not so long ago were persecuted by the Brits, but we were never bombed from the f****** skies with nowhere to go! The Palestinians have nowhere to go \u2013 it\u2019s their f****** home and they\u2019re bombing them from the sky. If you\u2019re not calling it a genocide what the f*** are you calling it?\u201d said Mo Chara while on stage.Kneecap came under renewed scrutiny at the start of this month when UK intelligence said they would investigate comments made by the rap group about UK and Middle East politics.They were reported to police over footage from a 2024 concert in which a band member appeared to say: \u201cThe only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.\u201d Footage from another concert, in 2023, appears to show a member of the trio shouting \u201cUp Hamas, Up Hezbollah\u201d \u2013 the UK considers both to be \u201cterrorist\u201d organisations.In response, Kneecap said it had \u201cnever supported Hamas or Hezbollah,\u201d and accused \u201cestablishment figures\u201d of taking comments out of context to \u201cmanufacture moral hysteria\u201d because of the band\u2019s criticism of Israel\u2019s attacks on Palestinians in Gaza.Several Kneecap gigs have been cancelled as a result of the controversy, and some British lawmakers have called on organisers of June\u2019s Glastonbury Festival to scrap a planned performance by the group."}

But Bar said Netanyahu\u2019s decision was motivated by a series of events between November 2024 and February 2025.In the unclassified part of the court submission, Bar said Netanyahu had told him \u201con more than one occasion\u201d that he expected Shin Bet to take action against Israelis involved in anti-government demonstrations, \u201cwith a particular focus on monitoring the protests\u2019 financial backers\u201d.The Shin Bet head also said he had refused to sign off on a security request aimed at relieving Netanyahu from testifying at an ongoing corruption trial in which he faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of public trust.The court said the decision to dismiss Bar was made without \u201ca factual basis\u201d and without giving him a formal hearing before firing him, according to a report by the Times of Israel.Wednesday\u2019s ruling noted \u201cirregularities\u201d in the process that led to Bar\u2019s sacking, as well as \u201ca disregard for fundamental principles regarding internal security.\u201dThe Israeli cabinet voted to dismiss Bar in March, triggering mass protests and accusations of autocratic pursuits by the far-right government.The High Court of Justice halted the decision until a hearing could be held. Several groups, including opposition politicians, had filed petitions with the court against the government\u2019s decision.In April, the government revoked the decision to fire Bar a day after he said he would step down.Following Bar\u2019s decision to quit the job, Wednesday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling said that \u201cthis announcement puts an end to the [legal] procedure.\u201d"}

How many trucks has Israel let in?", "date": "21 May 2025", "media_type": "news", "link": null, "content": "Palestinians in Gaza are on the verge of starvation and are desperate for aid.But, despite Israel officially relenting and publicly stating that it will now allow trucks to enter Gaza after a more-than-two-month blockade, only five aid trucks have actually entered the territory as of Tuesday night.And, even with those trucks inside Gaza, humanitarian workers have been prevented from distributing the aid inside them, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) spokesperson Jens Laerke.The population of the Gaza Strip, more than two million people before Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, is on the brink of famine, numerous aid agencies have said, with up to 14,000 babies at risk of dying from malnutrition if aid does not reach them. Despite the immense humanitarian cost, Israel\u2019s siege of the Strip continues. Israel says 93 trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday, but even if that were true and the aid distributed, it still amounts to approximately 20 percent of the territory\u2019s daily pre-war needs.After 11 weeks of unrelenting siege, the situation within Gaza is reported by numerous agencies to be desperate.Half a million people, or one in five Palestinians, are facing starvation. The rest of the population is, according to the UN\u2019s Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), suffering from high levels of acute food insecurity.Since yesterday, a few trucks of delivery aid managed to enter #Gaza but @UNReliefChief says they are 'a drop in the ocean of what\u2019s required'.https://t.co/7H98MUwSqR@UN_Spokesperson briefing the press \u2935\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/fWzb7lg5U4\u2014 UN News (@UN_News_Centre) May 21, 2025\u201cThe risk of famine in the Gaza Strip is not just possible \u2013 it is increasingly likely,\u201d  the IPC said, warning that an official famine could be declared as a direct result of Israeli action at any point between now and September.Officially, a famine occurs when at least 20 percent (one-fifth) of households face extreme food shortages; more than 30 percent of children suffer from acute malnutrition; and at least two out of every 10,000 people or four out of every 10,000 children die each day from starvation or hunger-related causes.The term famine refers to more than simply hunger. It refers to one of the worst humanitarian emergencies possible, indicating a complete collapse of access to food, water and the systems necessary to support life.The World Health Organization (WHO) reported last week that at least 57 children have died from the effects of malnutrition since Israel\u2019s complete blockade began on March 2.Emergency coordinator in Gaza for Doctors Without Borders \u2013 known by its French initials, MSF \u2013 Pascale Coissard, described the aid allowed into Gaza as \u201cridiculously inadequate\u201d. The organisation said that Israel was only permitting food and medicine into Gaza as \u201ca smokescreen to pretend the siege is over\u201d.\u201cThe Israeli authorities\u2019 decision to allow a ridiculously inadequate amount of aid into Gaza after months of an air-tight siege signals their intention to avoid the accusation of starving people in Gaza, while, in fact, keeping them barely surviving,\u201d Coissard said.Israel faces intense international pressure to lift its siege on Gaza. Twenty-three nations, including many of Israel\u2019s traditional allies, have condemned Israel\u2019s action in Gaza, with the United Kingdom, France and Canada threatening sanctions if aid is not allowed to reach those trapped within the enclave.Even the United States, typically Israel\u2019s closest ally, has conceded that aid is not entering Gaza in \u201csufficient amounts\u201d to avert the threat of famine.Not particularly.Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in indiscriminate Israeli attacks over the last week, taking the overall death toll to more than 53,500.Of those, more than 3,500 have been killed since the Israeli government decided to unilaterally break a ceasefire on March 18 and resume its offensive on the Gaza Strip.On Sunday, the Israeli military confirmed that it had expanded ground operations in the northern and southern stretches of the Gaza Strip as part of what it said was an intensified campaign to gain the concessions from Hamas that had eluded it through nineteen months of intense warfare, the destruction of nearly all of Gaza\u2019s buildings and the killing of tens of thousands of civilians, the majority women and children.Despite the humanitarian cost, the decision to allow what critics say is a performative and insufficient amount of food and medicine into Gaza has proven controversial within Israel.Israel\u2019s ultranationalist National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir condemned the decision to allow the small amount of aid into Gaza, calling it \u201ca serious and grave mistake\u201d.However, Ben-Gvir\u2019s fellow traveller on the hard right, Finance Minister Beezalel Smotrich, defended the decision, saying in a televised statement that Israel would permit the \u201cminimum necessary\u201d so \u201cthat the world does not stop us and accuse us of war crimes\u201d."}

Among those killed were at least eight people in Gaza City, two people in central Gaza\u2019s Nuseirat camp and two people in the Maghazi camp in central Gaza, according to Al Jazeera reporters in Gaza.The attacks come after Israel began allowing dozens of humanitarian trucks into Gaza on Tuesday, but the aid has not yet reached Palestinians in desperate need.Jens Laerke, the spokesperson for the UN\u2019s humanitarian agency, said no trucks were picked up from the Gaza side of Karem Abu Salem crossing, known as Kerem Shalom to Israelis, in southern Gaza.Israel announced that 93 aid trucks had entered Gaza from Israel following an 11-week blockade.Reporting from Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum explained that most of those trucks had only received military clearance to enter the Palestinian side of the crossing.\u201cThey are still stuck at the border crossing. Only five trucks have made it in,\u201d Abu Azzoum said, adding, \u201cThis could be another sign of the systematic obstruction of aid in Gaza.\u201dAid groups have said that the amount of aid that Israel is allowing is not nearly enough, calling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s efforts a \u201csmokescreen to pretend the siege is over\u201d.\u201cThe Israeli authorities\u2019 decision to allow a ridiculously inadequate amount of aid into Gaza after months of an air-tight siege signals their intention to avoid the accusation of starving people in Gaza, while, in fact, keeping them barely surviving,\u201d said Pascale Coissard, the emergency coordinator in Khan Younis for Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF.The Israeli military body that oversees humanitarian aid to Gaza said trucks were entering Gaza on Wednesday morning, but it was unclear if that aid would be able to continue deeper into Gaza for distribution.A few dozen Israeli activists opposed to Israel\u2019s decision to allow aid into Gaza while Hamas still holds Israeli captives attempted to block the trucks carrying the aid on Wednesday morning, but were kept back by Israeli police.Israel is facing growing international pressure over its renewed offensive on Gaza.The United Kingdom has suspended talks with Israel on a free trade deal, and the European Union said it will review a pact on political and economic ties over the \u201ccatastrophic situation\u201d in Gaza. Britain, France and Canada have threatened \u201cconcrete actions\u201d if Israel continues its offensive.Pope Leo on Wednesday also appealed for Israel to allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.\u201cI renew my fervent appeal to allow for the entry of fair humanitarian help and to bring to an end the hostilities, the devastating price of which is paid by children, the elderly and the sick,\u201d the pope said during his weekly general audience in Saint Peter\u2019s Square.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday urged world leaders to take immediate action to end Israel\u2019s siege on Gaza, issuing the appeal in a written statement during a visit to Beirut, where he is expected to discuss the disarmament of Palestinian factions in Lebanon\u2019s refugee camps.\u201cI call on world leaders to take urgent and decisive measures to break the siege on our people in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Abbas said, demanding the immediate entry of aid, an end to the Israeli offensive, the release of detainees and a full withdrawal from Gaza.\u201cIt is time to end the war of extermination against the Palestinian people. I reiterate that we will not leave, and we will remain here on the land of our homeland, Palestine,\u201d Abbas said.Since the war began in October 2023 following the Hamas attack that killed 1,139 people in southern Israel, Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed 53,573 people and wounded 121,688 others."}

United Nations officials and humanitarian groups say it will not have the ability to deal with the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza as a result of Israel\u2019s two-month-long blockade.Instead, the aid groups that have been working in Gaza point out that they have the capacity to bring in food and other humanitarian supplies \u2013 if only Israel would let them.So what is the GHF, and why is the situation in Gaza so desperate? Here\u2019s everything you need to know:Officially independent, the GHF is an Israeli- and US-backed body that plans to distribute aid in the Gaza Strip.One in five people in Gaza currently face starvation due to the Israeli blockade of food and aid while 93 percent are experiencing acute food shortages, according to a UN-backed assessment released last week.Under increasing international pressure to allow in aid, Israel has sought to find a solution that it says prevents aid from falling into the hands of the Palestinian group Hamas. Humanitarian organisations say the vast majority of food and other supplies reaches Gaza\u2019s civilian population and is not diverted to fighters.The GHF will be overseen by Jake Wood, a US military veteran who ran Team Rubicon, an organisation that distributed humanitarian aid during natural disasters.Through the GHF, Palestinians in Gaza would receive a \u201cbasic amount of food\u201d.The initial plan was announced last Wednesday with a timeline of about two weeks before it was up and running.It\u2019s still unclear how the GHF will be funded, but the foundation says it will set up \u201csecure distribution sites\u201d to feed 1.2 million people in Gaza before expanding to feed every Palestinian in the territory.It says it will coordinate with the Israeli military while security would be provided by private military contractors.The GHF initiative has been widely panned by aid groups and the UN.The UN and humanitarian aid agencies say they already have the means to distribute desperately needed aid and alleviate the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. The GHF, on the other hand, is seen by critics as a way of politicising aid and not having the experience or capacity to bring aid to more than two million people.The GHF \u201crestricts aid to only one part of Gaza while leaving other dire needs unmet\u201d, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said at the Security Council last week. \u201cIt makes aid conditional on political and military aims. It makes starvation a bargaining chip. It is cynical sideshow. A deliberate distraction. A fig leaf for further violence and displacement.\u201dThe UN and aid groups say the GHF plan violates basic humanitarian principles.\u201cWe are concerned by the proposed aid mechanism for Gaza and are deeply worried that it will not allow for humanitarian aid to be distributed in a manner consistent with core humanitarian principles of impartiality, humanity, and independence,\u201d a statement from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. \u201cThe ICRC cannot work under any mechanism that doesn\u2019t allow us to uphold the principles and our modalities of work.\u201dEleven humanitarian and human rights organisations signed a statement in which they \u201cunequivocally reject the establishment\u201d of the GHF, calling it:\u201cA project led by politically connected Western security and military figures, coordinated in tandem with the Israeli government, and launched while the people of Gaza remain under total siege. It lacks any Palestinian involvement in its design or implementation.\u201dThat lack of Palestinian involvement, coupled with Israel\u2019s approval for the project and the planned presence of the Israeli military \u201con the perimeter\u201d of the distribution sites, according to US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, raises Palestinian suspicions that the establishment of the GHF will give even more power to Israel over aid distribution in Gaza.Israel is blocking it.Israel began preventing the entry of all food and other humanitarian supplies into Gaza on March 2 during a ceasefire, which it unilaterally broke on March 18.Even before the blockade, Israel restricted the amount of aid that could come in, and some Israeli protesters also blocked and destroyed aid.The situation has reached dire levels with the World Food Programme saying 70,000 children need urgent treatment for \u201cacute malnutrition\u201d.The UN said the GHF would weaponise aid by threatening the mass displacement of Palestinians.Initial aid distribution sites would operate only out of southern and central Gaza, which the UN warned could lead to the displacement of Palestinians in northern Gaza as they are forced to move south for food and other aid.\u201cHumanitarian aid should not be politicized nor militarized,\u201d the ICRC statement said. \u201cThis erodes the neutrality required to ensure assistance is delivered based solely on need, not political or military agendas.\u201dThe initiative has also been labelled by many in the humanitarian sector as insufficient.\u201cEven if implemented, the plan\u2019s proposed aid volumes fall short of the immense scale of needs in Gaza,\u201d according to the ICRC. \u201cThe level of need right now is overwhelming, and aid needs to be allowed to enter immediately and without impediment.\u201dGaza currently has 400 distribution points, and the ability and know-how to distribute aid effectively exists. With only a few distribution points under the GHF, people may be forced to walk long distances and carry heavy rations.\u201cThe Problem is Not Logistics,\u201d the statement from the 11 humanitarian groups read. \u201cIt Is Intentional Starvation.\u201dEnough. We demand rapid, safe, and unimpeded access to starving civilians in Gaza.We have a plan. We have thousands of trucks of food at the border. Let us in.

The roads in Gaza have been badly damaged over the past 19 months of war, and the intensity of Israel\u2019s latest military operation in Gaza is only making things more difficult for Palestinians there.Furthermore, the GHF\u2019s assertions that it is independent and transparent have been criticised by aid groups.\u201cDespite branding itself as \u2018independent\u2019 and \u2018transparent,\u2019 the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation would be wholly dependent on Israeli coordination and operates via Israeli-controlled entry points, primarily the Port of Ashdod and the Kerem Shalom/Karem Abu Salem crossing,\u201d the statement by the 11 aid groups read.While Hanan Salah, Human Rights Watch\u2019s associate director for the Middle East and North Africa, didn\u2019t comment specifically on the GHF, she said allowing \u201ca basic amount of food\u201d into the Gaza Strip was \u201ccomplicity in using starvation as a method of warfare\u201d."}

We\u2019re supportive,\u201d Rubio continued. \u201cWe understand why for their security Hamas cannot exist. We are also very happy to see that they have allowed aid to begin to flow, and we hope that that will continue.\u201dSeveral Western countries, including close partners of Israel, have recently decried the Israeli siege on Gaza. On Monday, the leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Canada said in a joint statement that they were \u201chorrified\u201d by Israel\u2019s military escalations in Gaza and its blockade on humanitarian aid.They threatened to pursue \u201cconcrete actions\u201d like sanctions if Israel continued to expand its military assault.The administration of US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has remained staunchly pro-Israel, but experts say recent moves from the White House signal a growing gap between the US and Israel.For example, Trump did not include Israel as a stop in his recent trip to the Middle East. He has also initiated diplomatic talks with Iran and declared a ceasefire with Yemen\u2019s Houthi group \u2014 both of which are adversaries of Israel in the region.The Houthis, for instance, continue to launch missiles and drones at Israel in a show of support for the Palestinians in Gaza.Still, over the past three months, the US has refused to directly criticise Israel\u2019s decision to prevent food and medicine from reaching Gaza.But last week, at a stop in the United Arab Emirates, Trump indicated he wanted to get the situation in Gaza \u201ctaken care of\u201d.\u201cA lot of people are starving. There\u2019s a lot of bad things going on,\u201d he said.Also last week, in an interview with the BBC, Rubio said he was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher also told the BBC on Tuesday that as many as 14,000 children in Gaza are at risk of dying in the next 48 hours if food does not reach them.Last year, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant over possible war crimes in Gaza, including the use of starvation as a method of war.On Sunday, Netanyahu said Israel would only allow a \u201cbasic quantity of food\u201d into the Palestinian territory to stave off international pressure.\u201cOur best friends in the world \u2013 senators I know as strong supporters of Israel \u2013 have warned that they cannot support us if images of mass starvation emerge,\u201d he said, according to the publication Haaretz.The Gaza Government Media Office said on Tuesday that at least 58 Palestinians have died of malnutrition over the past 80 days.At Tuesday\u2019s Senate hearing, Rubio appeared to acknowledge that more aid needs to reach the Palestinians in Gaza.\u201cI understand your point that it\u2019s not in sufficient amounts,\u201d Rubio told Merkley. \u201cBut we were pleased to see that decision was made.\u201d"}

Settler violence has surged in the occupied West Bank as the world\u2019s focus has remained on Gaza. Nearly 1,000 Palestinians have been killed and thousands displaced in Israeli raids.The statement comes weeks after the Netherlands urged the European Union (EU) to review a trade agreement with Israel as the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has intensified its bombardment of Gaza amid an aid blockade in place since March 2.Western countries backed Israel\u2019s right to self-defence when Netanyahu\u2019s government launched a devastating offensive in Gaza on October 7, 2023. That offensive has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians and turned vast swathes of Gaza into rubble.On Tuesday, the EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that Israel has the right to defend itself, but its current actions go beyond proportionate self-defence.So what steps might Western countries take against Israel, and has Israel\u2019s latest Gaza onslaught forced them to change their position? Here is what you need to know:The countries\u2019 three leaders criticised Israel\u2019s renewed Gaza offensive, while describing the \u201chuman suffering\u201d of Palestinians in the coastal enclave as \u201cintolerable\u201d.They also said that Israel\u2019s announcement of letting some aid in was \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d.\u201cIf Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response,\u201d the leaders\u2019 statement said.\u201cThe Israeli Government\u2019s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable and risks breaching International Humanitarian Law.\u201cWe condemn the abhorrent language used recently by members of the Israeli Government, threatening that, in their despair at the destruction of Gaza, civilians will start to relocate. Permanent forced displacement is a breach of international humanitarian law.\u201dThe three Western leaders said that while they supported Israel\u2019s right to defend itself following Hamas\u2019s attack on October 7, \u201cthis escalation is wholly disproportionate\u201d.\u201cWe will not stand by while the Netanyahu Government pursues these egregious actions,\u201d they said.On Tuesday, the UK announced it would suspend trade talks with Israel over the Gaza war. It also imposed sanctions on settlers and organisations backing violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.Israel\u2019s conduct in its war on Gaza and the government\u2019s support for illegal settlements is \u201cdamaging our relationship with your government\u201d, said British Foreign Secretary David Lammy.My joint statement with @EmmanuelMacron and @MarkJCarney on the situation in Gaza and the West Bank. pic.twitter.com/76vYpB42xf\u2014 Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) May 20, 2025Amid intense international pressure, Israeli authorities on Monday cleared nine aid trucks to enter Gaza, where harsh restrictions on food and aid have sparked accusations that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war.However, the United Nations\u2019 relief chief Tom Fletcher called the entry of the trucks a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d, adding that \u201csignificantly more aid must be allowed into Gaza\u201d.Fletcher on Tuesday warned that 14,000 Palestinian babies were at risk of dying in the next 48 hours if aid doesn\u2019t reach them \u2013 a figure he called \u201cutterly chilling\u201d. Some half a million people in Gaza, or one in five Palestinians, are facing starvation due to the Israeli blockade.Starving Palestinians have resorted to eating animal feed and flour mixed with sand, highlighting acute suffering among the 2.3 million people in Gaza.The UN humanitarian office\u2019s spokesman Jens Laerke said on Tuesday that about 100 more trucks have been approved by Israel to enter Gaza.Shifting their focus to the occupied West Bank, the leaders of the UK, France and Canada said they opposed all attempts to expand Israeli settlements, as they are \u201cillegal and undermine the viability of a Palestinian state and the security of both Israelis and Palestinians\u201d.\u201cWe will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions,\u201d they said.Yara Hawari, co-director of Al-Shabaka, the Palestinian Policy Network, says the statement by the UK, Canada, and France is \u201creflective of states wanting to backtrack and try and cover up their complicity\u201d, highlighting that the situation in Gaza is the \u201cworst that it has ever been\u201d and that \u201cthe genocide is reaching new levels of cruelty and inhumaneness\u201d.\u201cThey can point to the statement and say, you know, well, we did \u2026 stand up against it,\u201d Hawari told Al Jazeera, adding that none have stopped arms sales to Israel.Hawari specifically referenced the UK\u2019s role, saying it was \u201cparticularly complicit in this\u201d. \u201cThere are reports coming out every day on how many weapons have been transferred from the UK to Israel over the course of the last 19 months,\u201d she said.Sweden\u2019s Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said on Tuesday that her country will push for EU sanctions against Israeli ministers because of insufficient steps to protect civilians in Gaza.\u201cSince we do not see a clear improvement for the civilians in Gaza, we need to raise the tone further. We will therefore now also push for EU sanctions against individual Israeli ministers,\u201d Stenergard said in a statement.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot demanded that Israel\u2019s \u201cblind violence\u201d and blockade of humanitarian assistance must come to an end.On Monday, 24 countries, overwhelmingly European ones, issued a joint statement saying Israel\u2019s decision to allow a \u201climited restart\u201d of aid operations in Gaza must be followed by a complete resumption of unfettered humanitarian assistance.It was signed by the foreign ministers of countries including Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands and the UK.Meanwhile, the European Union\u2019s top diplomat, Kallas, has decided to order a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, a free trade deal between the two regions. Kallas told Al Jazeera that the Netherlands earlier this month had sought review of the Association Agreement, particularly Article 2 \u2013 which states that both parties must respect human rights.The move has been backed by other member states, including Belgium, France, Portugal and Sweden.Robert Patman, a professor of international relations at the University of Otago in New Zealand, says the recent criticism emanating from Western capitals was in part due to public pressure.\u201cI think there\u2019s a sense that in liberal democracies, they can\u2019t ultimately be indifferent to public concern about the situation \u2026 I think another factor is a perception among many countries that [US President Donald] Trump himself is getting impatient with the Netanyahu government,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.Patman explained that with many countries in the Global South having experienced colonialism before, they were quicker than the West to condemn Israel\u2019s actions.\u201cThey have a history of having to struggle for their own political self-determination, and given that experience, they can empathise with the Palestinians who\u2019ve been denied the right,\u201d he said.Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on Monday criticised Carney, Macron and Starmer following their joint statement.\u201cBy asking Israel to end a defensive war for our survival before Hamas terrorists on our border are destroyed and by demanding a Palestinian state, the leaders in London, Ottawa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on 7 October while inviting more such atrocities,\u201d he posted on X.By asking Israel to end a defensive war for our survival before Hamas terrorists on our border are destroyed and by demanding a Palestinian state, the leaders in London, Ottowa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more\u2026\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05df \u05e0\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5 (@netanyahu) May 19, 2025Meanwhile, Israel\u2019s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich lashed out at the three leaders, saying his country \u201cwill not bow its head before this moral hypocrisy, antisemitism, and one-sidedness\u201d.In a post on X, Smotrich accused the three countries of \u201cmorally aligning themselves with a terrorist organisation\u201d.In particular, Smotrich took issue with the three countries saying they are \u201ccommitted to recognising a Palestinian state\u201d.\u201cThey have gone so far as to seek to reward terrorism by granting it a state,\u201d he said.Netanyahu\u2019s government and his far-right coalition partners have been vocal against the realisation of a sovereign Palestinian state despite broad international support for the so-called two-state solution.This major ground offensive, launched by Israel on the Gaza Strip on Sunday, came after days of intense bombardment that killed hundreds of Palestinians.Since Sunday, more than 200 people have been killed in a relentless wave of strikes.Major hospitals, including the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, have been rendered nonoperational after attacks by Israeli forces. Medical professionals said it could lead to the deaths of thousands of sick and wounded people.With the backing of Israel\u2019s lethal air force, the operation is targeting both southern and northern Gaza.The Israeli military said the offensive was launched to expand \u201coperational control\u201d in the Gaza Strip. Israel says its campaign also aims to free the remaining captives held in Gaza and defeat Hamas.However, Netanyahu has been repeatedly criticised by segments of Israeli society, including captives\u2019 families, for failing to prioritise their return. He has also rejected Hamas\u2019s offers to end the war and free the captives.Andreas Krieg, senior lecturer at the School of Security Studies at King\u2019s College London, said that the threats from the UK, France and Canada against Israel set a precedent for other Western governments to emulate.\u201cWhile it will not have a direct impact on Israel\u2019s behaviour on the ground, it widens the boundaries of discourse internationally and makes it easier for other governments to openly stand against Israeli atrocities,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\u201cKey to a change of behaviour in Israel, however, remains the United States,\u201d he said. The US supplies the bulk of arms to Israel as well as providing diplomatic cover at the United Nations.\u201cYet, there is a tangible erosion of consensus at play internationally as to the perception of Israel, which taints Israel increasingly as a rogue actor,\u201d Krieg said.Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian ambassador to the UK, told Al Jazeera that the \u201cnumber one\u201d thing the three countries could do was impose an arms embargo on Israel. \u201cThe UK has taken some measures to suspend some arms exports. It\u2019s not enough. It has got to be full and comprehensive,\u201d he said.Zomlot also said that the states should act to ensure that \u201cwar criminals\u201d were \u201cheld accountable\u201d. \u201cThey must absolutely support our efforts at the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice,\u201d he said.Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant face ICC arrest warrant for war crimes, but some European nations have said that they won\u2019t arrest them.Francesca Albanese, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, questioned how the threatened sanctions would be targeted.\u201cTargeting whom? You need to impose sanctions on the state. It\u2019s not about the prime minister. This is the entire government enterprise,\u201d she told Al Jazeera.Krieg from King\u2019s College London says the reputational damage will affect Israel far beyond the current war in Gaza.\u201cIt will be difficult to build consensus in the future around the narrative that Israel is an \u2018ally\u2019 because it is \u2018the only democracy in the Middle East\u2019,\u201d he told Al Jazeera."}

As of Monday, a trickle of aid was authorised to enter for the first time since then but was not immediately distributed.Addressing the European Humanitarian Forum in Brussels on Tuesday, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), said relief organisations have run out of words to describe the horrors unfolding in Gaza at Israel\u2019s hands.\u201cBut the worst in all this is that we are confronted with a situation: If there is political will, the war can stop. The siege being imposed on Gaza can be lifted,\u201d Lazzarini said.Since early March, at least 57 children are reported to have died from malnutrition.A UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) assessment says more than 93 percent of children in Gaza, or about 930,000, are at risk of famineUNRWA Director of Health Akihiro Seita added on Tuesday that the situation is getting \u201cexponentially\u201d worse and may soon arrive at a point that is \u201cbeyond our control\u201d.Israel told the UN on Tuesday that it would allow the entry of 100 trucks carrying humanitarian aid, a day after it said it allowed only nine aid trucks into the enclave for the first time in more than 80 days.But UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said no humanitarian aid has been distributed yet, despite more supplies being dropped off on the Palestinian side of the Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) crossing.The Israeli moves have been roundly slammed for fulfilling only a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d of the humanitarian needs in Gaza, which has been largely reduced to rubble by Israeli air strikes and ground operations, which were expanded at the weekend.Israeli attacks continue to kill dozens of Palestinians, including many children, each day while what\u2019s left of infrastructure and aid supplies are being destroyed.The municipality of Deir el-Balah in central Gaza announced on Tuesday that a major well, the last remaining source of drinking water in the area, was destroyed along with its generator in an Israeli strike.This comes as more than 100,000 Palestinians have been driven out of their homes and shelters in the past several days alone, according to the UN, and have nowhere safe to go as they face famine.The Israeli army on Tuesday bombed the Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza\u2019s Khan Younis as well, hitting life-saving medical supplies and causing widespread destruction across the hospital\u2019s different facilities, including oxygen lines and a laboratory.\u201cIn northern Gaza, the Indonesian Hospital is under siege by the Israeli military with patients unable to enter or get out,\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s Hind Khoudary said, reporting from Deir el-Balah.\u201cAside from the Nasser and Indonesian hospitals, two other major hospitals in Gaza, the European and al-Awda, have been bombed and largely put out of service in the past few days,\u201d she added.Tess Ingram, a UNICEF communications manager, explained to Al Jazeera why a scheme hatched by the United States and Israel to take control of aid distribution in Gaza was unacceptable for the international community.She said the UN and its international partners had 400 distribution points all over Gaza to help Palestinians whereas now only a \u201chandful\u201d of militarised points in southern Gaza will be used under the US-Israel plan.\u201cThis would mean that people would have to walk a long way to collect a packet that weighs up to 25kg [55lb] and then walk back again,\u201d she said.Speaking on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasised that only a \u201cminimal\u201d amount of aid will be allowed into Gaza for diplomatic and political reasons as international pressure and condemnation is directed at him and his government.His far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said allowing any aid into Gaza while some Israeli captives taken during the Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023, are still held inside the enclave is \u201ca grave mistake hindering our victory\u201d.As the Israeli military and government continue to promise to \u201cdefeat\u201d Hamas, devastating military strikes on the Palestinian territory have intensified.The Israeli army said on Tuesday afternoon that it attacked 100 targets in Gaza in the preceding 24 hours, claiming they were all \u201cterrorist\u201d targets.At least 53,573 Palestinians have been killed and 121,688 wounded since the start of the war, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health."}

The ministry called the UK sanctions \u201cunjustified and regrettable\u201d.The Labour government has been heavily criticised at home for not saying or doing enough in support of Palestinians under constant fire and facing starvation in besieged Gaza. Thousands of pro-Palestine demonstrators turn out for weekly marches in Britain.Labour MP Zarah Sultana accused Starmer\u2019s government of being \u201ccomplicit\u201d in a \u201ccampaign of collective punishment waged with impunity\u201d.She told Al Jazeera: \u201cFamilies have been obliterated, entire neighbourhoods reduced to rubble, and essential services like food, water and electricity deliberately targeted.\u201cThis is not a tragic accident of war. It is the predictable result of a campaign of collective punishment waged with impunity \u2026 The UK\u2019s failure to act is not just a moral disgrace \u2013 it is a political choice.\u201dFormer Labour Party leader and independent MP Jeremy Corbyn also told Al Jazeera the \u201conly one way the government can cease its complicity in genocide\u201d is by \u201cending military cooperation with Israel and imposing sanctions\u201d.Although the Labour government suspended some arms export licences to Israel, it made an exception for the F-35 fighter jet programme, citing its obligations to international supply chains.Meanwhile, a report from the Palestinian Youth Movement, Progressive International and Workers for a Free Palestine revealed earlier this month that the UK sent \u201c8,630 separate munitions\u201d since the partial arms suspension took effect in September.According to the UK government\u2019s own data released on Thursday, it approved 127.6 million pounds ($171m) worth of military equipment to Israel in single-issue licences between October and December 2024 \u2013 despite the partial arms embargo coming into place in September.Last week, a High Court case was launched challenging the UK\u2019s handling of arms export controls to Israel.Gearoid O Cuinn, founding director of the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), which has taken the UK government to court over the sale of weapons, told Al Jazeera that the government\u2019s decision to suspend a future trade deal has \u201cno bearing on the immediate catastrophe in Gaza\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s not a future trade deal that is facilitating the killing and starving kids,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ongoing supply of British weaponry and military support.\u201dAs international pressure intensifies on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government, the European Commission has launched a review of its trade agreement with Israel in response to the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d situation in Gaza.The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said a \u201cstrong majority\u201d of EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels supported the review of the bloc\u2019s association agreement with Israel.The move aims to determine whether Israel has breached its human rights obligations under Article 2 of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.France\u2019s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, speaking in parliament, welcomed the decision and said 17 of the EU\u2019s 27 member states had backed the proposal.Kallas also confirmed that EU sanctions targeting violent Israeli settlers had been drawn up but remain blocked by one member state, which she did not name.\u201cThe aid that Israel has allowed in is, of course, welcomed,\u201d Kallas said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a drop in the ocean.

The level of human suffering in Gaza is intolerable,\u201d the leaders said, also condemning Israel\u2019s actions in the occupied West Bank. \u201cIsrael must halt settlements which are illegal \u2026 We will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions.\u201dIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has launched Operation Gideon\u2019s Chariots in a bid to control all of Gaza after cutting off food, fuel and medical aid in early March, accused the three countries of offering a \u201chuge prize\u201d to the Palestinian group Hamas, which is currently holding dozens of Israeli captives.The three leaders slammed Netanyahu\u2019s move the previous day to allow a few trucks into the besieged enclave after nearly three months of total blockade as \u201cinadequate\u201d, warning that the Israeli government risked breaching international humanitarian law. Israel reportedly allowed in just a few trucks on Monday, but more were expected on Tuesday.They said they would not \u201cstand by\u201d while Israel pursued \u201cegregious actions\u201d, highlighting the \u201cabhorrent language\u201d on pushing Palestinians out of Gaza used by members of the Israeli government like Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and underlining that forced displacement would be illegal.Husam Zumlot, the Palestinian ambassador to the UK, told Al Jazeera that the \u201cnumber one\u201d thing the three countries could do was impose an arms embargo on Israel. \u201cThe UK has taken some measures to suspend some arms exports. It\u2019s not enough. It has got to be full and comprehensive,\u201d he said.Zumlot also said the states should act to ensure that \u201cwar criminals\u201d were \u201cheld accountable\u201d. \u201cThey must absolutely support our efforts at the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice,\u201d he said.Francesca Albanese, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, questioned how the threatened sanctions would be targeted. \u201cTargeting whom? You need to impose sanctions on the state. It\u2019s not about the prime minister. This is the entire government enterprise,\u201d she told Al Jazeera on Monday.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Tuesday that Israel\u2019s partial lifting of the blockade on Monday was \u201ctotally insufficient\u201d.\u201cIndiscriminate violence and the blocking of humanitarian aid by the Israeli government\u201d had turned the besieged territory into \u201ca death trap\u201d, he told France Inter radio.Reporting from Jordan\u2019s capital Amman, Al Jazeera\u2019s Hamdah Salhut questioned whether international pressure would have much effect on Netanyahu, pointing out his previously voiced intention to press on until \u201cabsolute victory\u201d and his belief that his country was fighting a \u201cwar of civilisation against barbarism\u201d.\u201cThey say that the expanding military ground offensive is the only way for them to move forward,\u201d she said.The three leaders spoke out as 23 countries, including the UK, France and Canada, issued a joint statement urging Israel to let aid into Gaza, warning that the population faced \u201cstarvation\u201d.The statement, published on Monday, said humanitarian aid should never be politicised, taking aim at Israel\u2019s \u201cnew model\u201d for aid, which would see the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation delivering supplies under Israeli military protection.\u201cIt places beneficiaries and aid workers at risk, undermines the role and independence of the United Nations and our trusted partners, and links humanitarian aid to political and military objectives,\u201d said the statement, which called on Israel to let the UN and aid organisations get on with their life-saving work.Al Jazeera\u2019s Step Vaessen, reporting from Amsterdam in the Netherlands, noted that the statement had been issued before Tuesday\u2019s meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Brussels, where it is expected the bloc\u2019s trade agreement with Israel will be coming under review.\u201cWhat we are seeing is a shift after one and a half years of ongoing bombardment on Gaza, with this blockade on food leading to a public outcry,\u201d she said.Human rights organisation Amnesty International said it was \u201coutrageous and morally reprehensible\u201d that the world had taken \u201cnearly 80 days of broadcast starvation and cruelty amidst genocide\u201d to exert pressure on Israel to lift its siege.As the world focused its attention on Israel, the military stepped up its deadly attacks across the Strip. At least 87 people were killed and 290 wounded during the past 24-hour reporting period, according to a daily update by the Gaza Health Ministry.The casualties bring the total number of people confirmed killed in Gaza during the war to 53,573 with 121,688 wounded, the ministry said."}

The past week has seen an intensification of violence across the besieged Palestinian territory, which has killed hundreds of people.The reason for the disappearance of the NGO provision remains unclear, and experts warned it may yet reappear in the bill before the final vote in the House, expected later in the week.The office of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera\u2019s request for comment.With a razor-thin majority in the House, Republicans need every vote to pass the tax bill, which Trump has put at the top of his agenda in Congress.Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the section may have been removed to avoid additional controversy for the must-pass bill, especially because the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan office that oversees procedures, may have rejected it for violating the rules.\u201cIt\u2019s possible that this is a hiccup that they didn\u2019t want, given that it wasn\u2019t even likely to go through,\u201d Hamadanchy told Al Jazeera.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that is the reason for sure. What I can tell you is that we continue to be very vigilant in case it comes back, either later this week or in the future.\u201dFor weeks, Trump has been calling on Congress to pass the bill, which extends his 2017 tax cuts, a key component of his economic plans.But the proposal has faced some opposition from conservative budget hawks, who have argued it does not cut spending enough and would add to the nation\u2019s $36.2 trillion debt. So Republicans can ill-afford unnecessary issues that could derail the passage of the legislation.Rights groups have been rallying against the \u201cnonprofit killer\u201d, saying it violates free speech and the right to due process.The proposal would have granted the secretary of state power to unilaterally declare an NGO \u201cterrorist supporting\u201d and make it ineligible for tax exemptions.It also said the government would not have to reveal the reason behind the designation if \u201cdisclosure of such description would be inconsistent with national security or law enforcement interests\u201d.Under the current rules, organisations certified to be nonprofits by the government get breaks on their federal income taxes. The status also makes donations to such groups tax deductible for donors.While the withdrawn measure would have allowed a targeted NGO to challenge the secretary of state\u2019s decision in court, losing the tax exempt status, even if temporarily, could have proven costly for nonprofits, especially smaller organisations.Hamadanchy said being accused of supporting terrorism could also have prompted banks to close down the accounts of the groups.\u201cAnd then you have legal costs fighting off the designation because even if you might win in court, it\u2019s going to take time to get there, and it\u2019s going to cause a lot of damage to your organisation through that process,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd that\u2019s sort of the point because they want to chill speech.\u201dHamadanchy noted that existing laws already make material support for a designated \u201cterrorist\u201d group a criminal offence with severe penalties.The legislative push coincided with the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on Palestinian rights supporters, especially on college campuses.Secretary of State Marco Rubio has revoked the student visas of several Palestine advocates \u2013 who have not been charged with a criminal offence \u2013 over allegations of \u201csupport for terrorism\u201d.Some advocacy groups have portrayed the \u201cnonprofit killer\u201d as part of a broader push to muzzle voices critical of Israel.\u201cThis bill is designed to silence dissent, especially from Muslim, Palestinian and civil rights organizations that speak out against injustice and genocide,\u201d the Council on American Islamic Relations said in a statement last week.\u201cIt threatens every nonprofit that engages in advocacy, educates the public, or challenges government policy.\u201dThe apparent setback for the nonprofit provision came nearly two weeks after House leaders cancelled a vote on a bill to restrict boycotts of Israel after a backlash from right-wing legislators who voiced opposition to the measure on free speech grounds.Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, said it would be \u201cinteresting\u201d to see how Republican leaders would deal with staunchly pro-Israel measures like the \u201cnonprofit killer\u201d going forward.\u201cThey on the one hand likely see this as a fun opportunity to embarrass Democrats \u2013 whose opposition will be framed as anti-Israel or enabling terror and antisemitism \u2013 and on the other hand they have to worry about principled opposition from within their own ranks,\u201d Friedman told Al Jazeera in a statement."}

Food security experts last week warned of famine amid accusations that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war.\u201cSignificantly more aid must be allowed into Gaza starting tomorrow morning,\u201d Fletcher said in a statement.The UN secretary-general\u2019s spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, confirmed the limited aid will be distributed through the world body\u2019s mechanisms but also reiterated the amount of aid crossing into Gaza \u201cis not enough\u201d.The Israeli decision on Sunday to allow \u201cminimal\u201d aid into Gaza came as it launched an intensified ground offensive during an ongoing heavy bombardment that has killed hundreds of people over the past week.On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video address pressure from international \u201callies\u201d was behind the move.Israel\u2019s \u201cgreatest friends in the world\u201d, he declared without mentioning specific countries, had said there is \u201c\u2018one thing we cannot stand. We cannot accept images of hunger, mass hunger. We cannot stand that. We will not be able to support you\u2019.\u201cTherefore, to achieve victory, we need to somehow solve the problem,\u201d Netanyahu said, stressing the aim of the intensified offensive is for Israel\u2019s forces to \u201ctake control of all\u201d of Gaza.Still, far-right members of his coalition government slammed the aid decision, with National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir calling it a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d.It came as the leaders of Britain, France and Canada warned their countries would take action, including possible sanctions, if Israel does not halt its renewed military offensive in Gaza and lift aid restrictions.\u201cThe Israeli Government\u2019s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable and risks breaching International Humanitarian Law,\u201d a joint statement released by the British government said, also expressing opposition to any attempt to expand settlements in the occupied West Bank.\u201cWe will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions,\u201d it added.Separately, 22 donor countries also issued a joint statement on Monday urging Israel to \u201callow a full resumption of aid into Gaza immediately\u201d.\u201cWhilst we acknowledge indications of a limited restart of aid,\u201d Gaza\u2019s population \u201cfaces starvation\u201d and \u201cmust receive the aid they desperately need\u201d, it said.The statement was signed by the foreign ministers of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK.Israel has been accused of weaponising hunger and using the blockade to try to ethnically cleanse Gaza.The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a US-based Muslim and Arab rights group, said the decision to allow a handful of aid trucks into the territory is an effort to buy goodwill as Israel continues a relentless military campaign that has killed more than 53,000 people over the past 19 months.\u201cThis is a completely insufficient, psychotic PR stunt by Netanyahu\u2019s genocidal government, which is determined to occupy and flatten Gaza, and then expel any Palestinians who survive,\u201d it said in a statement.Speaking at the opening of the annual World Health Assembly on Monday, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that Israel\u2019s block on aid has driven up the risk of famine.\u201cTwo million people are starving,\u201d Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned, noting that 160,000 tonnes of food are \u201cblocked at the border just minutes away\u201d.He said the WHO and other UN agencies stood ready to deliver aid into Gaza \u2013 if and when entrance is allowed. \u201cPeople are dying from preventable diseases as medicines wait at the border, while attacks on hospitals deny people care and deter them from seeking it,\u201d Tedros added.On Sunday, the Health Ministry in Gaza said the Indonesian Hospital, one of the largest partially functioning medical facilities in northern Gaza, had ceased work because of Israeli attacks.As Israel intensifies its offensive across Gaza, sources told the Reuters news agency there has been no progress in a new round of indirect talks in Qatar\u2019s capital, Doha between the Israeli government and Hamas, the Palestinian group that headed an attack in southern Israel on October 7, 2023 that killed an estimated 1,139 people, with more than 200 also taken captive."}

Human rights groups and United Nations-backed experts have accused Israel of systematically destroying Gaza\u2019s healthcare system.Earlier, Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of al-Shifa Hospital in the besieged enclave\u2019s north, told Al Jazeera on Sunday that the latest strikes \u2013 which have been ongoing since Saturday \u2013 indicate that Israeli attacks on Gaza\u2019s hospitals are intensifying.\u201cThe medical teams are really suffering, and we have a few numbers of medical teams and staff \u2026 and a lot of people are in need [of] more medical care,\u201d Abu Salmiya said by phone from the hospital on Sunday.Thousands of sick and wounded people could die, he warned. Blood donations are urgently needed.This has been underscored by Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which confirmed that Israeli forces besieged the facility in Beit Lahiya, adding that \u201ca state of panic and confusion is prevailing\u201d.The ministry later said that Israel had cut off the arrival of patients and staff, \u201ceffectively forcing the hospital out of service\u201d.With \u201cthe shutdown of the Indonesian Hospital, all public hospitals in the North Gaza Governorate are now out of service\u201d, it said.Gaza\u2019s healthcare facilities have been targeted repeatedly throughout Israel\u2019s deadly assault that began 18 months ago.Other facilities in the north that have been bombed, burned, and besieged by the Israeli military since the start of the war include Kamal Adwan Hospital, al-Shifa Hospital, al-Ahli Hospital, and al-Awda Hospital. Dozens of other medical clinics, stations, and vehicles have also come under attack.The targeting of health facilities, medical personnel and patients is considered a war crime under the 1949 Geneva Convention.Israel has also battered several hospitals in Gaza\u2019s central and southern areas, including Deir el-Balah\u2019s Al-Aqsa Hospital and the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.Earlier this week, Israel struck two hospitals in Khan Younis. Nine missiles slammed into and around the courtyard of the European Gaza Hospital, killing at least 16 people, while an attack on the Nasser Medical Complex killed two people, including a wounded journalist.Incessant attacks on Gaza\u2019s healthcare sector have left it reeling, devastating its ability to function, while doctors say they are out of medicine to treat routine conditions.Hospitals have also been on the verge of total collapse amid a brutal and ongoing blockade, where Israel continues to bar the entry of much-needed medical supplies, fuel, and other humanitarian aid including food and clean water.The crisis in Gaza has reached one of its darkest periods, humanitarian officials warn, as famine also looms.Israeli air strikes have killed hundreds of Palestinians in the last 72 hours.Strikes over the weekend have also put the European Hospital, the only remaining facility providing cancer treatments in Gaza, out of service.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said dozens of Palestinians have been wounded, and doctors say \u201cthey\u2019re facing numerous challenges in treating injuries because of a lack of medical supplies\u201d.\u201cIsraeli air strikes in Gaza are still escalating as drones and fighter jets hover in the sky,\u201d Khoudary said.The death toll has reached the same level of intensity as the earliest days of the war, said Emily Tripp, executive director of Airwars, an independent group in London that tracks recent conflicts.She says preliminary data indicate the number of incidents where at least one person was killed or injured by Israeli fire hovered around 700 in April. It\u2019s a figure comparable only to October or December 2023 \u2013 one of the heaviest periods of bombardment.In the last 10 days of March, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) estimates, an average of 100 children were killed or maimed by Israeli air strikes every day.Almost 3,000 of the estimated 53,000 killed by Israel since October 7, 2023, have lost their lives since Israel broke a fragile ceasefire on March 18, Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry said.Among those killed in recent days include a volunteer pharmacist with the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund, who was killed with her family in a strike on Gaza City on May 4.A midwife from Al Awda Health and Community Association was also killed with her family in another strike on May 7.A journalist working for Qatar-based television network Al Araby TV, along with 11 members of his family, was also killed."}

At least 53,339 Palestinians have been killed and 121,034 wounded since the start of the war in October 2023, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health.The Israeli army on Sunday confirmed the start of Operation Gideon\u2019s Chariots, which will involve regular and reserve soldiers of the Southern Command leading the ground invasion of both northern and southern Gaza, backed by the air force.It reported attacking more than 670 places in Gaza over the past week and claimed all were \u201cHamas targets\u201d located both above and beneath the ground. Israel has been accused of disproportionately targeting civilians in Gaza, including displaced families.Among the targets have been three major hospitals, adding to the systematic targeting of healthcare facilities across the enclave that has now put three hospitals out of commission this week alone.The Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza was rendered nonoperational on Sunday after the Israeli army laid siege to it beginning at dawn. Marwan al-Sultan, the director of the facility, which was the last functioning public hospital in the north, described the situation as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and called on international organisations to press for medical teams\u2019 safety.Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, told Al Jazeera that the bombing of the Indonesian Hospital is severely impacting chances of survival for those in need of medical care.Thousands of sick and wounded people could die, he warned, adding that blood donations are urgently needed.Dr Muhammad Zaqout, the director general of hospitals in Gaza, condemned \u201cIsrael\u2019s systematic measures against hospitals\u201d.\u201cIsrael deliberately kills wounded people by preventing them from reaching hospitals and directly targets patients, the wounded and medical staff inside hospitals,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.He said al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza\u2019s Jabalia and European Gaza Hospital in southern Gaza have also been bombed, endangering patients and medical staff.Hamas said in a statement early on Sunday that the attacks on displaced Palestinians in Khan Younis marked a \u201cbrutal crime\u201d that was a flagrant violation of international laws and norms.\u201cBy granting the terrorist occupation government political and military cover, the United States administration bears direct responsibility for this insane escalation in the targeting of innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip, including children, women, and the elderly,\u201d the Palestinian group said, also condemning the \u201congoing persecution and killing\u201d of media workers.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Israel\u2019s expanding operation in Gaza. \u201cI am alarmed by reported plans by Israel to expand ground operations and more,\u201d he said on X on Saturday.On Saturday, both Israel and Hamas confirmed that more mediated talks were under way in Qatar.Israel emphasised that the talks are being held with no conditions, including the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which it has completely blocked since March 2 despite looming famine.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signalled on Sunday that his government may be open to either a partial or a comprehensive agreement but only under strict conditions.\u201cEven at this very moment, the negotiation team in Doha is working to exhaust every possibility for a deal \u2013 whether according to the Witkoff framework or as part of ending the fighting, which would include the release of all the hostages, the exile of Hamas terrorists, and the disarmament of the Gaza Strip,\u201d his office said in a statement, referring to White House envoy Steve Witkoff.His office also slammed former Israeli negotiator Oren Setter, who resigned from the team in October and said in a February interview that Netanyahu had squandered two opportunities last year that would have released captives in exchange for ending the war.Setter, a retired brigadier general, criticised Netanyahu on Sunday, telling the public broadcaster Kan that he is concerned the government will once again \u201cmiss the opportunity\u201d of a comprehensive agreement in favour of a potential partial deal.Far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir on Sunday called on Netanyahu to pull the negotiating team back from Doha and refrain from signing any deal with Hamas.

He called Israel a \u201cdangerous cancerous tumour\u201d that must be \u201cuprooted\u201d.Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also told a gathering of navy officers on Saturday that Trump is extending a message of peace while threatening destruction at the same time as backing Israel\u2019s \u201cgenocide\u201d in the Gaza Strip.\u201cWhich one of this president\u2019s words should we believe? His message of peace, or his message of massacre of human beings?\u201d the Iranian president said, pointing out that Trump sanctioned the International Criminal Court (ICC) in a move that was internationally criticised.The statements came after Trump used his Middle East tour \u2013 during which he signed huge deals with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 to heap praise on Arab leaders neighbouring Iran and blasting the leadership in Tehran.The US president told Arab leaders they were developing their infrastructure while Iran\u2019s \u201clandmarks are collapsing into rubble\u201d after its theocratic establishment replaced a monarchy in a 1979 revolution.He said Iran\u2019s leaders have \u201cmanaged to turn green farmland into dry deserts\u201d as a result of corruption and mismanagement, and pointed out that Iranians are experiencing power outages several hours a day.The blackouts, a result of a years-long energy crisis that is hurting Iran\u2019s already strained economy, are expected to linger for the rest of this year as well, according to Iranian authorities.The largest associations of the mining, steel and cement industries in Iran on Saturday wrote a joint letter to Pezeshkian, urgently requesting him to review a 90 percent electricity use restriction imposed on the critical sectors.Trump, who hailed Syria\u2019s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa and lifted sanctions on Damascus, also took aim at Iran\u2019s regional policy.He described Tehran\u2019s support for the fallen establishment of President Bashar al-Assad as a cause of \u201cmisery and death\u201d and regional destabilisation.Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the US president\u2019s remarks as \u201cdeceptive\u201d, telling state media on Friday it was the US that hampered Iran through sanctions and military threats while backing Israel and attacking Syria.Parliament chief Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who was addressing an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference in Indonesia, said Trump\u2019s remarks showed he was \u201cliving in a delusion\u201d.Hossein Salami, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), addressed Trump directly on Friday and said even though Iran has beautiful landmarks, \u201cwe take pride in the elevation of character, identity, culture, and Islam\u201d.The sharp rhetoric in response to Trump\u2019s latest controversial comments come days after he teased that he may start calling the \u201cPersian Gulf\u201d the \u201cArabian Gulf\u201d soon.This angered Iranians across the board, prompting criticism of any attempt to rename the key waterway from average citizens online, authorities, local media, and even some pro-Trump Iranians outside the country who have been advocating for US sanctions and regime change.Both Iran and the US say they would prefer an agreement that would serve to quickly de-escalate tensions surrounding Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, despite the latest war of words.But after four rounds of negotiations mediated by Oman, any prospective deal \u2013 which would lift sanctions in exchange for making sure Iran would not have a nuclear bomb \u2013 still appears to face significant hurdles.Trump said Tehran has been handed a proposal to rapidly advance towards a deal, but Iran\u2019s Araghchi on Friday said no written proposal was produced yet amid \u201cconfusing and contradictory\u201d rhetoric from Washington.\u201cMark my words: there is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to enrichment for peaceful purposes: a right afforded to all other NPT signatories, too,\u201d he wrote in a post on X, in reference to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.Kazem Gharibabadi, a senior nuclear negotiator, on Friday rejected reports by Western media outlets that Iran may agree to fully halt its enrichment of uranium for the remainder of the Trump presidency to build trust.\u201cThe right to enrich is our absolute red line! No halt to enrichment is acceptable.\u201dTrump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear accord signed between Iran and world powers three years earlier, imposing the harshest sanctions yet by the US that have only intensified during the latest negotiations.The nuclear deal set a 3.67 percent enrichment rate with first-generation centrifuges for civilian use in Iran, in exchange for lifting United Nations sanctions. Iran is now enriching up to 60 percent and has enough fissile material for multiple bombs, but has made no effort to build one yet."}

Many more could starve to death in the coming days and weeks unless immediate action is taken,\u201d it said.Meanwhile, the Council of Europe, a body that works to safeguard human rights and democracy, also noted that Gaza was suffering from a \u201cdeliberate starvation\u201d and warned that Israel was sowing \u201cthe seeds for the next Hamas\u201d in the territory, referring to the Palestinian armed group.\u201cThe time for a moral reckoning over the treatment of Palestinians has come \u2013 and it is long overdue,\u201d said Dora Bakoyannis, rapporteur for the Middle East at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.The European calls came hours after UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said 160,000 pallets of relief and 9,000 trucks were ready to enter Gaza.\u201cTo those proposing an alternative modality for aid distribution, let\u2019s not waste time. We already have a plan,\u201d he said in a statement.\u201cWe have the people. We have the distribution networks. We have the trust of the communities on the ground. And we have the aid itself \u2013 160,000 pallets of it \u2013 ready to move. Now,\u201d he said.\u201cWe demand rapid, safe, and unimpeded aid delivery for civilians in need. Let us work.\u201dIsrael has halted the entry of food, medication and all other essentials into Gaza since March 2. UN agencies and other humanitarian groups have warned of shrinking food, fuel and medicine supplies to the territory of 2.4 million Palestinians facing acute starvation.Earlier, the US and Israel said they were preparing a plan that would allow the resumption of aid by an NGO, while keeping supplies out of Hamas\u2019s hands.Under the heavily criticised alternative aid plan, the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aims to start work in Gaza by the end of May.It intends to work with private US security and logistics firms to transport aid into Gaza to so-called secure hubs where it will then be distributed by aid groups, a source familiar with the plan told the Reuters news agency. It is unclear how the foundation will be funded.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has also asked Israel to allow humanitarian deliveries by the UN and aid groups to resume now until its infrastructure is fully operational, saying this is essential to \u201calleviate the ongoing humanitarian pressure\u201d.The UN, however, said it would not work with the foundation because the distribution plan is not impartial, neutral or independent. Israel says the blockade, alongside \u201cmilitary pressure\u201d, is intended to force Hamas to free the remaining captives.On Thursday, senior Hamas official Basem Naim reiterated the group\u2019s position that the entry of aid into Gaza is a prerequisite for any truce talks with Israel.\u201cAccess to food, water and medicine is a fundamental human right \u2013 not a subject for negotiation,\u201d he said."}

In recent days, Israel has intensified its offensive, as tens of thousands of Palestinians are forced to starve.At a preparatory meeting of the Arab League summit, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said they will try to endorse decisions that were made at their meeting in Cairo in March to support Gaza\u2019s reconstruction as an alternative to Trump\u2019s widely condemned proposal to take over the enclave.During his visit to Qatar, Trump on Thursday reiterated that he wanted the US to \u201ctake\u201d Gaza and turn it into a \u201cfreedom zone\u201d. Earlier this year, he caused an uproar by declaring that the US would turn Gaza into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East\u201d, prompting Arab leaders to come up with a plan to rebuild the territory, at a summit in Cairo.The Arab plan for Gaza proposes rebuilding the Palestinian enclave without displacing its 2.4 million residents.Besides Gaza, Arab officials also discussed Syria, which only six months ago entered a new chapter in its history after the fall of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad.Earlier this week, Trump in Riyadh met Syria\u2019s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose group spearheaded the offensive that toppled al-Assad last December. Prior to their meeting, he also announced that US sanctions on Syria will be lifted in a huge boost to the government in Damascus.Al-Sharaa, who was imprisoned for years in Iraq on charges of belonging to al-Qaeda following the 2003 US-led invasion, however, missed Baghdad\u2019s summit after several powerful Iraqi politicians voiced opposition to his visit. The Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani represented Damascus instead.Saturday\u2019s summit also came amid Iran\u2019s ongoing nuclear talks with the US. Trump has pursued diplomacy with Iran as he seeks to stave off a threatened military strike by Israel on Iran, a desire shared by many of the region\u2019s leaders.On Thursday, Trump said a deal was \u201cgetting close\u201d, but by Friday, he was warning that \u201csomething bad is going to happen\u201d if the Iranians do not move fast.Iraq has only recently regained a semblance of normalcy after decades of devastating conflict and turmoil, and its leaders view the summit as an opportunity to project an image of stability.Reporting from Baghdad, Al Jazeera\u2019s Mahmoud Abdelwahed said the summit was \u201cvery crucial\u201d for Iraq.\u201cThis is the first time the summit has been held in Iraq since 2012 and Iraq takes it as a credit to regain its rule as a player to bridge the gap between member states of the Arab League,\u201d he said."}
{"website": "aljazeera", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/16/five-key-takeaways-from-us-president-donald-trumps-middle-east-trip", "title": "Five key takeaways from US President Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East trip", "date": "16 May 2025", "media_type": "news", "link": null, "content": "Washington, DC \u2013 Three days, three countries, hundreds of billions of dollars in investments and a geopolitical shift in the United States\u2019s approach to the region: Donald Trump\u2019s trip to the Middle East has been eventful.This week, the United States president visited Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in the first planned trip of his second presidency, after attending Pope Francis\u2019s funeral last month.Trump was visibly gleeful throughout the trip as he secured investments, criticised domestic political rivals and heaped praise on Gulf leaders. The word \u201chistoric\u201d was used more than a few times by US officials to describe the visits.With Trump returning to the White House, here are five key takeaways from his trip:Addressing an investment summit in Riyadh, Trump promoted a realist approach to the Middle East \u2014 one in which the US does not intervene in the affairs of other countries.He took a swipe at neoconservatives who oversaw the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as he lauded Gulf leaders for developing the region.\u201cThis great transformation has not come from Western intervention or flying people in beautiful planes, giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs,\u201d he said.\u201cThe gleaming marbles of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called nation-builders, neo-cons or liberal nonprofits like those who spent trillions and trillions of dollars failing to develop Kabul, Baghdad, so many other cities.\u201dTrump built his political brand with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d slogan, calling for the US to focus on its own issues instead of helping \u2014 or bombing \u2014 foreign countries.But his words at the investment summit marked a stern rebuke of the neo-cons who dominated Trump\u2019s Republican Party a decade ago.\u201cIn the end, the so-called nation-builders wrecked far more nations than they built, and the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves,\u201d Trump said.It is rare for US presidents to travel to the Middle East and not visit Israel, but Trump omitted the US ally from his itinerary as he toured the region.Skipping Israel was seen as a reflection of the deteriorating ties between the US administration and the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.This week\u2019s trip also came in the context of several moves perceived as evidence of the US marginalising Israel. The US has continued to hold talks with Israel\u2019s rival Iran, announced a ceasefire with the Houthis in Yemen, and conducted unilateral negotiations to release Israeli soldier Edan Alexander, a US citizen, from Hamas captivity.Moreover, while touring the Gulf, Trump did not use his remarks to prioritise the establishment of formal diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which had been a top goal during his first term.It remains unclear how Trump\u2019s decisions will affect the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the two allies, but experts say it is becoming increasingly apparent that the US no longer views the Middle East solely through the lens of Israel.\u201cIs it a tactical problem for Netanyahu and the entire pro-Israel lobby? I think it is,\u201d Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University, said of Trump\u2019s shift.\u201cIt does throw a wrench in the machinery because it is a president who is showing openly daylight with Israeli decision-making, and not just in rhetoric, but acting on it \u2014 leaving Israel out of the process.\u201dWith that chasm emerging, some Palestinian rights advocates had hoped that the US president\u2019s trip to the region would see Washington pursue a deal to end Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.But as Trump marvelled at the luxurious buildings in the Gulf, Israel intensified its bombardment to destroy what\u2019s left of the Palestinian territory.No ceasefire was announced, despite reports of continuing talks in Doha. And Israel appears to be pushing forward with its plan to expand its assault on Gaza as it continues to block aid for the nearly two million people in the enclave, leading to fears of famine.United Nations experts and rights groups have described the situation as a genocide.But despite preaching \u201cpeace and prosperity\u201d for both Israelis and Palestinians, Trump made no strong push to end the war during this week\u2019s trip.On Thursday, Trump suggested that he has not given up on the idea of depopulating Gaza and turning it over to the US \u2014 a proposal that legal experts say amounts to ethnic cleansing.\u201cI have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good. Make it a freedom zone,\u201d he said. \u201cLet the United States get involved, and make it just a freedom zone.\u201dIn a move that surprised many observers, Trump announced from Riyadh that he will offer sanction relief to Syria, as the country emerges from a decade-plus civil war.Trump also met with interim Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa and described him as a \u201cyoung, attractive guy\u201d.A wholesale lifting of sanctions was not expected, in part because of Israel\u2019s hostility to the new authorities in Syria. Israeli officials often describe al-Sharaa, who led al-Qaeda\u2019s branch in Syria before severing ties with the group, as a \u201cterrorist\u201d.But Trump said he made the decision to lift the economic penalties against Syria at the request of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkiye\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\u201cI will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,\u201d the US president said.The White House said on Wednesday that Trump had a list of requests for al-Sharaa, including establishing diplomatic relations with Israel and deporting \u201cPalestinian terrorists\u201d.Removing US sanctions, which had been imposed on the government of former President Bashar al-Assad, is likely to be a boost for the new Syrian authorities, who are grappling with an ailing economy after years of conflict.\u201cLifting sanctions on Syria represents a fundamental turning point,\u201d Ibrahim Nafi Qushji, an economist, told Al Jazeera.\u201cThe Syrian economy will transition from interacting with developing economies to integrating with more developed ones, potentially significantly reshaping trade and investment relations.\u201dIn Saudi Arabia, Trump declared that he wants a deal with Iran \u2014 and he wants it done quickly.\u201cWe really want them to be a successful country,\u201d the US president said of Iran.\u201cWe want them to be a wonderful, safe, great country, but they cannot have a nuclear weapon. This is an offer that will not last forever. The time is right now for them to choose.\u201dTrump warned Iran that, if it rejects his \u201colive branch\u201d, he would impose a \u201cmassive maximum pressure\u201d against Tehran and choke off its oil exports.Notably, Trump did not threaten explicit military action against Iran, a departure from his previous rhetoric. In late March, for instance, he told NBC News, \u201cIf they don\u2019t make a deal, there will be bombing.\u201dIran says it is not seeking nuclear weapons and would welcome a stringent monitoring programme of its nuclear facilities.But Israel and some hawks want the Iranian nuclear programme completely dismantled, not just scaled back.US and Iranian officials have held multiple rounds of talks this year, but Tehran says it has not received an official offer from Washington. And Trump officials have not explicitly indicated what the endgame of the talks is.US envoy Steve Witkoff said last month that Iran \u201cmust stop and eliminate\u201d uranium enrichment, but days earlier, he had suggested that enrichment should be brought down to civilian energy levels.Several Gulf countries, including the three that Trump visited this week, have welcomed the nuclear negotiations, as relations between Iran and its Arab neighbours have grown more stable in recent years.Before entering politics, Trump was a real estate mogul who played up his celebrity persona as a mega-rich dealmaker. He appears to have brought that business mindset to the White House.While in the wealthy Gulf region, Trump was in his element. He announced deals that would see Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE buy US arms and invest in American firms. According to the White House, Trump secured a total of $2 trillion in investments from the Middle East during the trip.And his administration is framing the deals as a major political and economic victory for Trump.\u201cWhile it took President Biden nearly four years to secure $1 trillion in investments, President Trump achieved this in his first month, with additional investment commitments continuing to roll in,\u201d the White House said.\u201cPresident Trump is accelerating investment in America and securing fair trade deals around the world, paving the way for a new Golden Age of lasting prosperity for generations to come.\u201d"}

The extent of any damage was not clear, and there no immediate reports of casualties.The Houthis have carried out a campaign of attacks against Israel in self-proclaimed solidarity with Palestinians after Israel launched its assault on Gaza in October 2023.Israel has carried out strikes in response, including one on May 6 that damaged Yemen\u2019s main airport in Sanaa and killed several people.Friday\u2019s attacks were the first since US President Donald Trump agreed to a ceasefire deal with the Houthis earlier this month, with the US halting its attacks on Yemen and the group agreeing to end its attacks on shipping lanes in the Red Sea.Israel was not included in that agreement, and its military said it intercepted several missiles fired from Yemen towards Israeli airspace this week.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday that the attacks are \u201cjust the beginning\u201d, describing the Houthis as \u201cjust a tool\u201d, alleging that Iran was \u201cbehind them\u201d.\u201cWe will not stand idly by and allow the Houthis to harm us.

The last week has shown the opposite, an intensification of violence across the besieged Palestinian territory, leaving hundreds dead, and hundreds of thousands terrified of what comes next.This was a week where United States President Donald Trump toured the Middle East, visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. There had been hope that some kind of ceasefire deal would be announced, or that the US would put more pressure on Israel to seriously come to the negotiating table. That was particularly the case after Hamas released a US-Israeli captive on Monday without demanding anything in exchange.Ultimately, none of that happened, with Trump returning to his idea of US involvement in the future administration of whatever is left of Gaza, while acknowledging that Palestinians there were starving.Israel also intercepted a number of missiles fired by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, before attacking Yemen itself on Friday.Lets take a closer look at a week that has devastated Gaza, and left Palestinians there feeling even more abandoned.According to figures compiled by Al Jazeera, at least 370 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since Sunday. The violence has been particularly deadly in the second half of the week, with medical sources reporting the killing of at least 100 Palestinians on Friday, and 143 on Thursday. Many of those killed have been women and children.These are some of the worst single-day death tolls since the beginning of the war in October 2023.The killings put the total death toll reported by the Gaza Ministry of Health more than 53,000, although the territory\u2019s Government Media Office\u2019s death toll now sits at more than 61,700, as it includes thousands of Palestinians still under the rubble who are presumed dead.Israeli attacks have targeted the whole Gaza Strip, with a particular focus on the north. Hospitals have also repeatedly been bombed by Israel.The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has been caused by Israel\u2019s complete blockade of the entry of all food and medication to the Strip since March 2, a decision it made when the ceasefire was still ongoing, and one that goes against international law.A report released on Monday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) initiative said that the Gaza Strip was \u201cstill confronted with a critical risk of famine\u201d, with half a million people facing starvation and 93 percent of its more than 2 million population at severe risk.People are already starving to death \u2013 Gaza authorities last week said that 57 people had died as a result of starvation.Trump acknowledged that \u201ca lot of people are starving\u201d in Gaza and said that the US was \u201cgoing to get that taken care of\u201d, but provided few details. The US has backed a new body called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that it says will start work in Gaza by the end of the month.But the plan has been rejected by the United Nations and other humanitarian groups, who say that the plan would lead to more displacement for Palestinians in Gaza, as it would only disperse aid in some areas of Gaza, and set a dangerous precedent for the delivery of aid in warzones.The UN has reiterated that it has the capacity to deliver aid across Gaza, but is being prevented from doing so by Israel. It says it has enough aid ready to deliver to feed all of the Palestinians in Gaza for four months, if Israel allows its trucks in.Palestinians in Gaza have been recounting the horrors of the past week, desperately calling for the world to act and stop Israel\u2019s bombing.In northern Gaza\u2019s Jabalia refugee camp, one of the worst hit areas, one civilian had a simple message \u2013 \u201ceither kill us or let us live.\u201d\u201cAll of [the strikes] were targeting civilians. All the houses are being bombed \u2013 everything is gone,\u201d Ahmed Mansour told Al Jazeera. \u201cWhat is a person supposed to do? They\u2019re all making a joke out of us. I\u2019m heading to the coast now. We\u2019ve been displaced more than 50 times \u2013 either kill us or let us live.\u201dTaher al-Nunu, a senior Hamas official, also called on Friday for the US to put more pressure on Israel to open the crossings into Gaza and \u201callow the immediate entry of humanitarian aid \u2013 food, medicine and fuel \u2013 to the hospitals in the Gaza Strip\u201d.The Israeli government has made it clear that it is unwilling to agree to a deal that would end the war in return for the release of all the Israeli captives still held in Gaza, despite widespread domestic support for such a deal.Instead, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks of total victory against Hamas, although it is difficult to see what that would entail.Instead, the war drags on, and Netanyahu said on Monday that preparations were continuing for \u201can intensification of the fighting\u201d. Last week, he said that Israel was planning for the \u201ctotal conquest\u201d of Gaza.Trump left the Middle East this week with no ceasefire deal agreed, only saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to find out pretty soon\u201d when asked whether a deal was in place for the return of Israel\u2019s captives.Meanwhile, the Israeli newspaper Ha\u2019aretz reported that Israel\u2019s position was \u201crigid\u201d and that the US had \u201clost interest\u201d. A source told the newspaper that US envoy Steve Witkoff was \u201cno longer involved\u201d.\u201cHe\u2019s waiting to hear what we want, and since we don\u2019t want anything, he has nothing left to do,\u201d the source said."}

The Israeli military has not commented on the strikes.Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated a promise to push ahead with a promised escalation in pursuit of his aim to destroy Hamas, the Palestinian armed group that governs Gaza.That follows an announcement by Netanyahu last week that the military campaign would be intensified should Hamas fail to agree a deal to release the remaining captives by the time United States President Donald Trump finished his tour of the Middle East.Trump was due to wrap up his four-day trip, which did not include a visit to Israel or Palestine, on Friday.There had been hope that the tour could help usher in a ceasefire deal or renewal of aid to Gaza. The humanitarian crisis in the enclave is building with an Israeli blockade of the territory now in its third month.However, Israeli officials suggested last week that plans include the \u201cconquest\u201d and full military occupation of the entire Gaza Strip, and potentially a bid to push Palestinians out of the enclave \u2013 a suggestion also put forward by Trump.Israel\u2019s war on Gaza has killed at least 53,010 Palestinians and wounded 119,919, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health. The Strip\u2019s Government Media Office has updated its death toll to more than 61,700, saying thousands of others missing under the rubble are presumed dead.Israel has halted the entry of food, medication and all other essentials into Gaza since March 2, saying that the blockade, alongside \u201cmilitary pressure\u201d, is intended to force Hamas to free the remaining captives.However, senior Hamas official Basem Naim reiterated on Thursday the group\u2019s position that the entry of aid into Gaza is a prerequisite for any talks with Israel.\u201cAccess to food, water and medicine is a fundamental human right \u2013 not a subject for negotiation,\u201d he added.The US and Israel are preparing a plan that they say will allow the resumption of aid by an NGO, while keeping supplies out of Hamas\u2019s hands.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has said it will begin distributing aid this month. However, the United Nations and other aid organisations have ruled out involvement in the initiative, saying it does not respect the impartiality, neutrality and independence of aid operations.However, the US is pushing on, apparently keen to \u201cget involved\u201d in Gaza, as Trump put it during his trip to the region.Speaking in the United Arab Emirates on Friday, the US president said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at Gaza. And we\u2019re going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving.\u201dThe previous day, however, he reiterated his idea of having the US take over Gaza and pushing Palestinians out of the enclave.\u201cI have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good \u2026 let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,\u201d he said, adding that he would be \u201cproud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone\u201d.The comments echoed a widely condemned idea he floated in February for the US to \u201ctake over\u201d the devastated territory and redevelop it into \u201cthe Riviera of the Middle East\u201d.In response, Hamas official Naim said that the territory is \u201cnot for sale\u201d.\u201cGaza is an integral part of Palestinian land,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt is not real estate for sale on the open market.\u201d"}

A report released by Doctors of the World (Medecins du Monde) this week states that in just 18 months, acute malnutrition in Gaza has risen to levels similar to those found in countries enduring protracted humanitarian crises spanning several decades.Starvation is when the human body is deprived of food for so long that it suffers and often dies.Estimates say the body can last up to three weeks without food, but the length of time varies between individuals.Starvation occurs over three stages. The first begins as early as when a meal is skipped, the second occurs with a prolonged period of fasting where the body uses stored fat for energy.The third, and often fatal, stage is when all stored fats have been depleted and the body turns to bone and muscle as sources of energy.Children are most vulnerable to Israel\u2019s continued blockade of essential food items.More than 9,000 children have been admitted to hospital for treatment for acute malnutrition since the start of the year, according to the United Nations.The IPC projects that between now and March 2026, nearly 71,000 children under the age of five will suffer from acute malnutrition, including 14,100 children facing severe cases of malnutrition.The effect of malnutrition on children varies, but the first 1,000 days of a child\u2019s life, which includes the pregnancy up to two years, are critical for a child\u2019s healthy development.Malnutrition leads to an out-of-proportion height-to-weight ratio, stunted growth and eventually, death.Earlier this month, at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, Dr Ahmed Abu Nasir said the situation has become worse than ever due to the blockade.\u201cChildren are in their growing stage and badly need certain nutrients, including proteins and fats,\u201d the paediatrician told Al Jazeera. \u201cThese are not available in the Gaza Strip, particularly in the north.\u201dPregnant and breastfeeding women will also need to be treated for malnutrition, with 17,000 women facing this risk.The entire population of Gaza, about 2.1 million people that remain, are facing levels of food shortages that threaten their existence.Earlier this month, Ahmad al-Najjar, a displaced Palestinian in Gaza City, told Al Jazeera, \u201cFinding a single meal has become an impossible quest.\u201dDespite large numbers of trucks carrying vital supplies piling up on the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, Palestinians in Gaza have resorted to selling rubbish to afford the eye-wateringly inflated food prices.Some 93 percent of Gaza\u2019s population is at risk of levels of food insecurity above the crisis levels indicated by the IPC. If the situation does not change, the IPC has indicated that of those 2.1 million people:In essence, in as little as a month, Gaza\u2019s entire population could be starving.The features of malnutrition and starvation are unmistakable in Gaza, with severely underweight children and babies. In children, severe protein deficiency causes fluid retention and a swollen abdomen.Food insecurity across the Gaza Strip is severely affecting all areas of the blockaded enclave.All 25 bakeries supported by the World Food Programme (WFP) closed at the beginning of April due to the lack of supplies, and food stocks for most of the 177 hot meal kitchens are reportedly exhausted.Certain governorates are experiencing more severe levels of hunger. According to the IPC:The IPC says Israel\u2019s continued blockade \u201cwould likely result in further mass displacement within and across governorates\u201d, as items essential for people\u2019s survival will be depleted.

But eventually he signed and said he hadn\u2019t committed any war crimes.\u201dIn an account of his interaction with the Israeli tourist posted on X last month, Kishi described the man as an otherwise pleasant guest and admitted to feeling a \u201clittle sorry for him\u201d.\u201cThe pledge thing made us pretty awkward, but he still greeted me every time we met,\u201d Kishi wrote.\u201cHe even held the door open for me while I was carrying my luggage. But he believed that what Israel was doing was absolutely right and thought that I was brainwashed for criticising it.\u201dGiven the number of troops deployed in Gaza, the number of casualties there, and the number of Israeli travelers abroad, it is statistically undeniable that those who have committed war crimes are walking freely in major cities and tourist destinations in the world.\u2014 Guesthouse WIND VILLA (@WindVilla) May 1, 2025The Israeli tourist, who has not been named, shared a similar version of events with an Israeli news outlet following his trip to Kyoto \u2013 although the Israeli report suggested the pledge was a \u201ccondition for check-in\u201d.\u201cIn the end, I decided to sign it because I have nothing to hide,\u201d the guest was quoted as telling Ynet News, which said the tourist had served as a combat medic in the navy reserves.\u201cThe statement is true \u2013 I did not commit any war crimes, and Israeli soldiers do not commit war crimes. I signed because I didn\u2019t want to create problems, and because this form means nothing,\u201d he was quoted as saying.Following complaints from Cohen and the Israeli embassy, Kyoto tourism authorities visited the guest house several times to carry out an investigation, Kishi said.\u201cAt least the authorities, both from the city and the Japanese government, don\u2019t think it\u2019s a violation of the Hotel Act,\u201d Kishi said, referring to the Japanese law governing public accommodations.\u201cThey are just expressing their concerns and trying to convince us to change our measures. But it\u2019s beyond their authority, so it\u2019s very indirect.\u201dKishi said he has tweaked the wording of the pledge to state that it would not affect guests\u2019 eligibility to stay at WIND VILLA, to avoid further incidents.He also clarified in a public letter to Cohen that the pledge requires \u201call guests whom our guesthouse identifies as potentially having been involved in war crimes to sign the form,\u201d including those from Burundi, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Mali, Myanmar, Palestine, Russia, Syria, and Sudan.Booking.com has suspended WIND VILLA\u2019s account since the April incident, although the Israeli guest used rival site Expedia.com to book his stay, according to Kishi.On April 28, our guesthouse was suddenly suspended by https://t.co/ALza8eLJ8e without any prior inquiry, just three days after receiving a letter from the Israeli Ambassador.\nHowever, the Israeli guest in question had used a different booking site, not https://t.co/ALza8eLJ8e. pic.twitter.com/t9Z2OJ3ghF\u2014 Guesthouse WIND VILLA (@WindVilla) May 1, 2025WIND VILLA\u2019s other accounts on booking sites, including Expedia.com, continue to operate as normal, Kishi said.The Kyoto government and Israel\u2019s embassy in Tokyo did not reply to Al Jazeera\u2019s requests for comment.The Japan Times quoted a city official as saying WIND VILLA had not violated Japanese law, but the pledge was \u201cinappropriate\u201d.Booking.com told Al Jazeera that the company\u2019s mission \u201cis to make it easier for everyone to experience the world, and we do not tolerate discrimination of any kind\u201d.\u201cWe have temporarily suspended this property so that we can investigate the matter further,\u201d the spokesperson said.The WIND VILLA incident follows a similar occurrence in Kyoto last year, when a local hotel refused an Israeli man accommodation over his potential ties to Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza.The Kyoto hotel in question received verbal and written warnings from the city that it had acted illegally, according to Japan\u2019s Kyodo News.Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa told local media at the time that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for any hotel to refuse accommodation because of a guest\u2019s nationality.\u201cWe hope all visitors to Japan will be able to engage in various activities in Japan, feeling secure,\u201d she told a news conference."}

In Jabalia in northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on al-Tawbah medical clinic killed at least 15 people and wounded several others, the health ministry said.Israel\u2019s army also attacked three hospitals in north and south Gaza: al-Awda hospital in Jabalia, the Indonesian Hospital in Khan Younis, and the European hospital, which Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry says is now out of service.Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah, described \u201canother bloody day\u201d in Gaza, as Israel intensified its air attacks on residential areas.\u201cIsraeli warplanes directly targeted nine houses without any warning in the city of Khan Younis,\u201d he said, adding that entire families were \u201ccompletely wiped out\u201d.He described the situation as chaotic, with civilians fleeing repeated forced evacuation orders. \u201cThe Israeli military targeted civilians while they were asleep,\u201d launching 13 air raids on the Jabalia refugee camp and nearby areas. Civil defence teams, he added, were overwhelmed and struggling to rescue those trapped under the rubble, due to a lack of equipment.Abu Azzoum said the strikes reflect a \u201cpattern of attacks not aimed at military targets, but at systematically destroying Gaza\u2019s social fabric\u201d.Hamas said in a statement that Israel was making a \u201cdesperate attempt to negotiate under cover of fire\u201d as indirect ceasefire talks take place between Israel and Hamas, involving US envoys and Qatar and Egyptian mediators in Doha.The latest killings come amid new waves of forced displacement. Thousands fled Gaza City on Thursday after the Israeli military issued forced evacuation orders the day before.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hani Mahmoud reported scenes of panic and fear as residents packed their belongings and tried to escape the expected onslaught.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing families carrying their belongings and taking to the streets,\u201d Mahmoud said. \u201cThe children and elderly are carrying whatever they\u2019re able to carry \u2026 They don\u2019t know where to go. There is no safe place for these people \u2013 the so-called shelters have already been destroyed by Israeli bombs.\u201dSpeaking to Al Jazeera, displaced Palestinian Hasan Moqbel described the continuing assault as a war on civilians. \u201cThey have been bombing Gaza for 19 months. What\u2019s left in Gaza? Innocent children are dying. There is no armed activity here. Most of them are elderly people who are dying,\u201d he said.The attacks come as Palestinians mark the 77th anniversary of the Nakba, or catastrophe, when more than 750,000 Palestinians were forcibly expelled by Zionist paramilitary groups during the creation of Israel in 1948.Regarding the wider mood in Gaza on Nakba Day, Abu Azzoum said people were \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about a potential expansion of Israeli ground operations. \u201cThey believe the Israeli army may force them to flee again \u2013 to new areas where conditions are even worse.\u201dDespite international diplomacy, \u201cthere is no sign of a slowdown on the ground,\u201d he warned.Elsewhere in the region, President Donald Trump concluded a visit to Qatar on Thursday, where Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani urged the leader of the United States to use his influence to help secure a ceasefire in Gaza.\u201c\u200aOur teams are engaged in intensive diplomacy to secure a ceasefire in Gaza to protect all civilians, especially innocent women and children, and ensure the release of all hostages,\u201d Al Thani said during a state dinner on Wednesday.\u201cThis conflict is the key to wider stability in the region. From the West Bank to Yemen to Lebanon, and time is short,\u201d the Qatari leader said.\u201cMr President, your involvement could catalyse a breakthrough where others have stalled. But only if done in concert with serious partners \u2026 The United States brings power, leverage, and global weight. If we act together, we have a real shot at ending the bloodshed and restoring regional confidence,\u201d he added.Trump on Thursday reiterated his radical vision for the future of Gaza, suggesting Washington should take control of the besieged territory.\u201cI have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good, make it a freedom zone, let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone.\u201dTrump\u2019s comments come as Israel\u2019s war on Gaza continues to escalate, with the enclave suffering unprecedented levels of destruction and civilian casualties.The US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, spoke to Al Jazeera\u2019s diplomatic editor James Bays this week and \u201cpainted a positive picture on a deal on Gaza\u201d, with a potential agreement being reached \u201cpretty soon\u201d.When asked whether Witkoff was referring only to aid access \u2013 given that aid is currently completely blocked for the people of Gaza, with no food or medicine getting in \u2013 or to a ceasefire, he replied, \u201cAll of it, I\u2019m positive about all that.\u201dMeanwhile, the Israeli government appears to be laying the groundwork for a parallel escalation in the occupied West Bank.Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a key figure in Israel\u2019s far-right coalition, has openly called for military forces to destroy Palestinian towns and villages in the West Bank, echoing the destruction witnessed in Gaza.\u201cJust as we are flattening Rafah, Khan Younis and Gaza, we have to flatten the terror hubs,\u201d Smotrich said, referring specifically to the Palestinian village of Bruqin, where an Israeli settler was killed on Wednesday evening.Israeli forces launched new raids across the occupied West Bank at dawn on Thursday, storming cities and refugee camps including Tubas, Nablus, Bethlehem and Dura. Residents in Qalandiya, Ya\u2019bad, Fawwar and Askar camps also reported house raids, arrests and what rights groups describe as systematic abuse.Later, Israel\u2019s military said it killed five Palestinians and arrested a sixth who had barricaded themselves in a building in Tammun, about 35km (22 miles) from Bruqin, following an exchange of fire with soldiers.The military wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group issued a statement saying five of its members were killed while clashing with Israeli forces that surrounded their house in the town of Tammun."}

Humanitarian and United Nations aid groups have said that they already have the means of delivering aid to Gaza but are being blocked from doing so by Israel.Israel has completely cut off Gaza\u2019s access to food, water, fuel, and humanitarian aid since March 2, prompting global monitors of extreme hunger to warn of possible famine and allegations of the use of starvation as a weapon of war by human rights groups.Israel has claimed, with little evidence, that members of the armed Palestinian group Hamas are stealing large portions of aid entering the Strip, and have pushed for the exclusion of UN organisations, long viewed with ire by Israeli authorities, from aid distribution.A newly created body with US backing called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said on Wednesday that it would begin operations in Gaza by the end of May, and that it has asked Israel to allow increased levels of aid into the Strip.Critics have said that the new organisation fulfils an Israeli goal of sidelining the UN and independent international organisations from aid distribution in Gaza.\u201cGHF emphasizes that a successful humanitarian response must eventually include the entire civilian population in Gaza,\u201d the foundation\u2019s executive director, Jake Wood, wrote in a letter to the Israeli government.\u201cGHF respectfully requests that the [Israeli military] identify and deconflict sufficient locations in northern Gaza capable of hosting GHF-operated secure distribution sites that can be made operational within 30 days,\u201d he added.A recent report by the Observer, a UK-based news outlet, notes that a GHF fundraising document appears to mirror claims about the problems of humanitarian assistance in Gaza that do not include the actions of the Israeli government itself and instead blame a \u201ccollapse\u201d of \u201ctraditional humanitarian channels\u201d due to aid diversion and combat operations.Thousands of aid trucks have been bottlenecked outside of Gaza amid Israel\u2019s blockade for weeks, with UN officials stressing that they are ready and capable of resuming aid distribution in the Strip, if Israel will lift the siege."}

The question will likely eventually be decided by the US Supreme Court.The administration has further relied on the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to justify its actions. An obscure provision of the law allows the US secretary of state to deport any non-citizen deemed to have \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign consequences\u201d.In a separate ruling related to Columbia University Student Mahmoud Kahlil in April, a federal judge adopted a broad interpretation of the provision, saying Kahlil was deportable based on Rubio\u2019s claims he took part in \u201canti-Semitic\u201d protests. That came despite the top US diplomat providing no further evidence.Similarly, the Department of Homeland Security had previously claimed in a post on X that Khan Suri was \u201cspreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media\u201d.It added he \u201cwas married to the daughter of a senior advisor for to Hamas terrorist group\u201d.But speaking to reporters, Nermeen Arastu, one of the lawyers representing Khan Suri, noted that evidence backing up those claims has not been presented by government lawyers in court.Arastu, who is also an associate professor of law at the CUNY School of Law, said it was notable that \u201cthe court today also pointed out that the government is kind of throwing around accusations in social media, but not presenting them in the formal courtroom setting\u201d.\u201cAnd tied that to this due process concept that\u2019s so important here to understand \u2013 that at the very basic level, you have a right to understand the allegations that are being brought against you,\u201d she said.Critics have further accused the Trump administration of targeting Khan Suri based on his familial ties. His wife is the daughter of Ahmed Yousef, a former adviser to assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh who left his position with the armed group more than a decade ago.\u201cHe should have never been arrested and jailed for his constitutionally protected speech just because the government disagrees with him,\u201d ACLU of Virginia senior immigrants\u2019 rights lawyer Sophia Gregg, told reporters on Wednesday.\u201cHe should have never been punished for his relationship with his wife or his father-in-law,\u201d she said.Like in the cases of Ozturk and Mahdawi, Khan Suri\u2019s cases will proceed despite his release. He faces two separate legal proceedings, one in immigration court in the one challenging his arrest and detention in Virginia.He remained in detention in Texas when the ruling was issued on Wednesday, his lawyers said, adding they were expecting him to be released shortly.Saleh said at the court that she had recently spoken to her husband from the detention centre in Texas, where he was held.\u201cHe told me if my suffering in the detention centre is because I married a Palestinian and because I spoke out against the genocide in Gaza, then I should wear it as a badge of honour,\u201d she said."}

How do you look in the mirror knowing that you\u2019re abandoning 58 hostages?\u201dThe mounting anger among families has only deepened in recent days following Netanyahu\u2019s nomination of Major General David Zini as the next head of the Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic intelligence agency.Zini has reportedly voiced opposition to any deal to bring an end to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, telling colleagues during Israeli military meetings: \u201cI oppose hostage deals. This is a forever war,\u201d according to Israel\u2019s Channel 12.\u201cThe families of the kidnapped are outraged by the words of Major General Zini. If the publication is true, these are shocking and condemnable words coming from someone who will be the one to decide the fate of the kidnapped men and women,\u201d the forum said in a statement on Friday.\u201cAppointing a Shin Bet chief who puts Netanyahu\u2019s war before the abduction of the kidnapped is tantamount to committing a crime and doing injustice to the entire people of Israel,\u201d the group said.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, says Netanyahu\u2019s new appointment \u201cwants military pressure and escalation in the war on Gaza, and that\u2019s why he was chosen\u201d.\u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of pressure on Netanyahu internationally in the last couple of weeks to try to get Israel to end the blockade of Gaza and stop the war altogether, and the expanding military operations. The military says all the brigades called up are now operating inside Gaza, she continued.\u201cFamily members say the intensified attacks will only kill the remaining captives. But Netanyahu is part of the most right-wing Israeli government in Israel\u2019s history \u2013 people who have largely been against any ceasefire deal, largely against any end to the war\u201d, she added.Netanyahu\u2019s decision to appoint Zini came just one day after Israel\u2019s Supreme Court found his attempt to fire outgoing Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar to be \u201cunlawful\u201d, citing a conflict of interest tied to Netanyahu\u2019s ongoing corruption trial.Despite the court ruling that Netanyahu could not appoint a replacement, he proceeded with the appointment of Zini anyway.The attorney general later warned that the prime minister had defied legal guidance and tainted the appointment process.The criticism comes as Netanyahu still faces an international arrest warrant request from the International Criminal Court over war crimes committed during the Gaza war."}

At least 53,822 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since October 7, 2023 and more than 122,382 others wounded \u2013 most of them women and children.Israel claims about 300 trucks have entered Gaza since Monday through the Karem Abu Salem crossing, known as Kerem Shalom to Israelis, but the UN says only a third of those deliveries have reached warehouses inside the enclave due to security constraints and chaos on the ground.The figure is far short of the more than 500 trucks that entered Gaza daily before the start of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza in October 2023.A new United States-backed delivery mechanism \u2013 run by the newly established Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) \u2013 is expected to take over aid distribution by the end of the month. Under the plan, private contractors would escort supplies to secure hubs, where civilian teams would handle distribution.But the UN has refused to participate, saying the scheme does not meet basic humanitarian standards.\u201cThe United Nations has been clear: we will not take part in any scheme that fails to respect international law and the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality,\u201d Guterres said.He stressed that the UN already has the infrastructure to respond. \u201cThe supplies \u2013 160,000 pallets, enough to fill nearly 9,000 trucks \u2013 are waiting,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is my appeal for life-saving aid for the long-suffering people of Gaza: let\u2019s do it right.

Together, they represent part of a small but increasingly visible groundswell of resistance in Israel to a war that, for a variety of reasons, many Israelis are turning their backs on.\u201cSome people are protesting because they see it as a political war,\u201d Green, who also serves as national co-director of the activist group Standing Together, said of the growing sense in Israel that the war on Gaza only serves to sustain Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing coalition.\u201cSome are tired of fighting, some want the hostages [to be released from Gaza] , and some [are protesting against] what we\u2019re doing to Palestinians.

Nevertheless, the war has continued.\u201cI don\u2019t know if popular pressure\u2019s going to ever stop the war,\u201d said Green. \u201cI mean, its supporters have been in a minority for a year. Refusing [to answer the call up] is our most powerful weapon: no soldiers, no occupation. We need more and more people to refuse.\u201dAll the antiwar activists Al Jazeera spoke to talked of an uptick in interest in their movement following the Israeli government\u2019s unilateral decision in mid-March to collapse the ceasefire it had previously agreed to after months of negotiation.Others spoke of a dramatic increase in support when, after 11 weeks of unremitting siege on Gaza, Israel announced its latest mass ground operation in the devastated Palestinian territory on May 17, intended, according to one Israeli official, to lead to \u201cthe conquest of the Gaza Strip and the holding of the territories\u201d.Before its latest offensive, Israel called up what it said were \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of reservists to bolster its numbers in Gaza.Speaking after the announcement of the latest military attack on Gaza, Israel\u2019s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was clear in what he saw as the aims of the offensive, saying that, within months, Gaza would be \u201ctotally destroyed\u201d and what remains of its pre-war population of more than two million would be exiled to a narrow strip of land along the Egyptian border.However, despite the new offensive to recapture ground already largely destroyed by the Israeli military, dissent is gaining ground.Open letters protesting the war from military units and reservists publicly refusing to turn up for service are becoming more frequent. In April, more than a thousand of Israel\u2019s current and former pilots, generally regarded as an elite unit, wrote an open letter protesting a war they said served the \u201cpolitical and personal interests\u201d of Netanyahu, \u201cand not security ones\u201d.There are no official numbers for how many reservists have not turned up for duty. But, according to Israeli media reports, the number may be as high as 100,000. Those numbers are in addition to those refusing their initial period of mandatory military service.Most of those are \u201cgrey\u201d refusals, activists say. That is, people who gave no political reason for refusing to serve, officially refusing for other reasons, such as declining on medical grounds.But Sofia Orr, a 19-year-old from Pardes Hannah in northern Israel, is one of a growing number of conscripts refusing their mandatory service and making that refusal as public as possible.Orr refused to serve three times after first being called up on February 24, 2024. Her first and second refusals each netted her 20 days in military prison. Her third cost her 45 days.\u201cI\u2019d already decided to refuse when I was 15,\u201d Orr told Al Jazeera. \u201cI asked myself, \u2018If I go and serve in the military, what cause am I serving, does it align with my values, who am I actually helping?\u2019\u201d she said.\u201cIf I enlist, am I just entering the cycle of bloodshed that occupies and bloodily oppresses Palestinians daily?\u201d she said of defying what she described as hardwired societal expectations of Israeli life.\u201cI wanted to challenge that, so it wasn\u2019t just about refusing, but doing so as publicly and loudly as possible. I needed people to see it and know that we exist, that they could do the same, to bring Palestinian suffering into Israeli society and for Palestinians to see it and know they were not alone,\u201d she said.Orr is a member of \u201cMesarvot\u201d, an Israeli organisation that has been supporting conscientious objectors in the face of calls from prominent politicians for refusers to be arrested and prosecuted, including from cabinet member and former Israeli military spokesperson Miri Regev.\u201cThere\u2019s been a steady growth of refusers since October 7,\u201d Nimrod Flaschenberg, a political analyst and spokesperson for Mesarvot said, referring to the 2023 attack on southern Israel that led to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been seeing an exponential increase of 16-, 17-year-olds refusing to serve recently. There are around a hundred circulating an open letter, all refusing service and explaining why.\u201dOf the wider movement, Flaschenberg said, some refused to serve in a war they had come to regard as political, others because they felt it risked the lives of the captives and a minority out of revulsion for the mass killing in Gaza and the West Bank that they were being asked to participate in.\u201cThere\u2019s still an Israeli public taboo over showing any public sympathy for Palestinians,\u201d Flaschenberg said of the low prominence given to Gaza in the reasons given by most refusers, contrasting that with the widespread outrage that greeted ex-General and leader of Israel\u2019s Democrats party, Yair Golan, because he warned that Israel risked becoming regarded as a \u201cpariah state\u201d that killed Palestinian babies \u201cas a hobby\u201d if it didn\u2019t \u201creturn to sanity\u201d.\u201cThat really demonstrates the level of ignorance we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Flaschenberg said. \u201cOf course, Israel is killing babies, but Israelis just can\u2019t accept that.\u201dHowever, while growing international condemnation of Israel concentrates on vilifying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to Orr, it risks overlooking a harsher reality.\u201cFor many people here, it\u2019s Israelis who are the real victims, the first, the last and only victims in all of this,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t even see Palestinians as people, just as a threat.\u201dGreen, who immediately rejoined the protest on the Gaza border after his overnight release from house arrest was over, was equally fatalistic.\u201cI\u2019m not confident we\u2019ll succeed. The government has represented a minority of Israelis for around a year, and the war\u2019s continued,\u201d he said.But, despite that, he was not ready to give up on calling for Israelis to wake up.\u201cThings are already bad enough,\u201d Green added. \u201cWe\u2019ve destroyed nearly every building in Gaza, we\u2019ve killed 18,000 babies, and about 53,000 people. This is something we\u2019re going to have to live with.\u201d\u201cDo we really want to live with any more?\u201d"}

Her injunction is set to last for approximately two weeks, and she set hearing dates on May 27 and 29.Friday\u2019s lawsuit against the Trump administration is Harvard\u2019s second in less than two months.The latest is a response to a decision on Thursday announced by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Her department oversees the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, and she said she is revoking Harvard\u2019s privilege to use the system based on its failure to address Trump administration concerns.\u201cThis administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,\u201d she wrote on social media.The revocation means that Harvard can no longer accept foreign students. Those already enrolled will need to transfer to another school.The move represents a major escalation in Trump\u2019s pressure campaign against Harvard and other top US universities. He has accused schools of allowing anti-Semitism to fester, promoting \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d diversity programmes, and pushing ideological slants.But in Friday\u2019s lawsuit, Harvard called the Trump administration\u2019s actions a \u201cblatant violation\u201d of the US Constitution and other federal laws.Barring the prestigious Ivy League school from enrolling its international students would have an \u201cimmediate and devastating effect\u201d on the university and the more than 7,000 visa holders in its student body, it argued.\u201cWith the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard\u2019s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cWithout its international students, Harvard is not Harvard.\u201dTrump\u2019s current battle against higher education can be largely traced back to the pro-Palestine protests that broke out on US campuses last year, in response to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Trump made cracking down on the antiwar protests a centrepiece of his 2024 re-election campaign.While there have been instances of harassment from participants on both sides of the issue, protest organisers have rejected claims of widespread anti-Jewish sentiment. Some campus protests have even been spearheaded by Jewish students and organisations, including Jewish Voice for Peace.Earlier this year, task forces at Harvard itself issued two reports, warning about instances of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias, as well as anti-Semitism.Harvard has said it is working to address these concerns. Nevertheless, in April, Harvard became the latest school to receive a list of demands from the Trump administration.The list included reforming its hiring and admissions practices, refusing to admit students deemed \u201chostile to the American values and institutions\u201d, doing away with diversity programmes, and auditing academic programmes and centres, including several related to the Middle East.Harvard rejected the demands and immediately faced a freeze in $2.2bn in multi-year grants and $60m in multi-year contracts. Several federal agencies have since frozen tens of millions of dollars more in grants to Harvard.The university responded to Trump\u2019s funding freezes with a lawsuit in April, saying the administration was violating the First Amendment of the US Constitution with its \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d cuts.Trump has also floated revoking Harvard\u2019s tax exempt status, and in April, Noem sent a letter to Harvard first threatening to revoke its Student and Exchange Visitor Program approval if administrators did not send information on any foreign students\u2019 \u201cillegal and violent activities\u201d.At the end of April, Harvard said it had provided all legally required information, without providing further details.Friday\u2019s lawsuit seeks immediate relief from the Trump administration\u2019s decision to de-certify Harvard\u2019s ability to register foreign students, citing \u201cirreparable harm inflicted by this lawless action\u201d.In response to the complaint, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson accused the school of doing too little to address the Trump administration\u2019s concerns.\u201cIf only Harvard cared this much about ending the scourge of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators on their campus, they wouldn\u2019t be in this situation to begin with,\u201d Jackson said.\u201cHarvard should spend their time and resources on creating a safe campus environment instead of filing frivolous lawsuits,\u201d she added.In a letter to the Harvard community, school President Alan Garber framed Trump\u2019s attack on Harvard\u2019s foreign student body as part of \u201ca series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence\u201d.Garber described the de-certification as evidence of the \u201cfederal government\u2019s illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body\u201d.In its complaint, Harvard said the de-certification has thrown \u201ccountless\u201d academic programmes, clinics, courses and research laboratories into disarray.Harvard enrolled nearly 6,800 international students in its current school year, equal to 27 percent of its total enrolment.On Thursday, Noem also said Harvard could avoid the move if it turned over more information on foreign students, including video or audio of their protest activity over the past five years.Harvard has maintained it has already met the legal requirements in its disclosures."}

How do you look in the mirror knowing that you\u2019re abandoning 58 hostages?\u201dThe mounting anger among families has only deepened in recent days following Netanyahu\u2019s nomination of Major General David Zini as the next head of the Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic intelligence agency.Zini has reportedly voiced opposition to any deal to bring an end to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, telling colleagues during Israeli military meetings: \u201cI oppose hostage deals. This is a forever war,\u201d according to Israel\u2019s Channel 12.\u201cThe families of the kidnapped are outraged by the words of Major General Zini. If the publication is true, these are shocking and condemnable words coming from someone who will be the one to decide the fate of the kidnapped men and women,\u201d the forum said in a statement on Friday.\u201cAppointing a Shin Bet chief who puts Netanyahu\u2019s war before the abduction of the kidnapped is tantamount to committing a crime and doing injustice to the entire people of Israel,\u201d the group said.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, says Netanyahu\u2019s new appointment \u201cwants military pressure and escalation in the war on Gaza, and that\u2019s why he was chosen\u201d.\u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of pressure on Netanyahu internationally in the last couple of weeks to try to get Israel to end the blockade of Gaza and stop the war altogether, and the expanding military operations. The military says all the brigades called up are now operating inside Gaza, she continued.\u201cFamily members say the intensified attacks will only kill the remaining captives. But Netanyahu is part of the most right-wing Israeli government in Israel\u2019s history \u2013 people who have largely been against any ceasefire deal, largely against any end to the war\u201d, she added.Netanyahu\u2019s decision to appoint Zini came just one day after Israel\u2019s Supreme Court found his attempt to fire outgoing Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar to be \u201cunlawful\u201d, citing a conflict of interest tied to Netanyahu\u2019s ongoing corruption trial.Despite the court ruling that Netanyahu could not appoint a replacement, he proceeded with the appointment of Zini anyway.The attorney general later warned that the prime minister had defied legal guidance and tainted the appointment process.The criticism comes as Netanyahu still faces an international arrest warrant request from the International Criminal Court over war crimes committed during the Gaza war."}

At least 53,822 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since October 7, 2023 and more than 122,382 others wounded \u2013 most of them women and children.Israel claims about 300 trucks have entered Gaza since Monday through the Karem Abu Salem crossing, known as Kerem Shalom to Israelis, but the UN says only a third of those deliveries have reached warehouses inside the enclave due to security constraints and chaos on the ground.The figure is far short of the more than 500 trucks that entered Gaza daily before the start of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza in October 2023.A new United States-backed delivery mechanism \u2013 run by the newly established Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) \u2013 is expected to take over aid distribution by the end of the month. Under the plan, private contractors would escort supplies to secure hubs, where civilian teams would handle distribution.But the UN has refused to participate, saying the scheme does not meet basic humanitarian standards.\u201cThe United Nations has been clear: we will not take part in any scheme that fails to respect international law and the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality,\u201d Guterres said.He stressed that the UN already has the infrastructure to respond. \u201cThe supplies \u2013 160,000 pallets, enough to fill nearly 9,000 trucks \u2013 are waiting,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is my appeal for life-saving aid for the long-suffering people of Gaza: let\u2019s do it right.

Together, they represent part of a small but increasingly visible groundswell of resistance in Israel to a war that, for a variety of reasons, many Israelis are turning their backs on.\u201cSome people are protesting because they see it as a political war,\u201d Green, who also serves as national co-director of the activist group Standing Together, said of the growing sense in Israel that the war on Gaza only serves to sustain Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing coalition.\u201cSome are tired of fighting, some want the hostages [to be released from Gaza] , and some [are protesting against] what we\u2019re doing to Palestinians. All are welcome,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou want to resist the government? You\u2019re welcome. You don\u2019t want to enlist? You\u2019re welcome. You supported the war until just recently? You\u2019re welcome.\u201dPolls in Israel show that the majority now favour a deal that would secure the release of the captives held in Gaza, even if that means an end to the war on Gaza. Nevertheless, the war has continued.\u201cI don\u2019t know if popular pressure\u2019s going to ever stop the war,\u201d said Green. \u201cI mean, its supporters have been in a minority for a year. Refusing [to answer the call up] is our most powerful weapon: no soldiers, no occupation. We need more and more people to refuse.\u201dAll the antiwar activists Al Jazeera spoke to talked of an uptick in interest in their movement following the Israeli government\u2019s unilateral decision in mid-March to collapse the ceasefire it had previously agreed to after months of negotiation.Others spoke of a dramatic increase in support when, after 11 weeks of unremitting siege on Gaza, Israel announced its latest mass ground operation in the devastated Palestinian territory on May 17, intended, according to one Israeli official, to lead to \u201cthe conquest of the Gaza Strip and the holding of the territories\u201d.Before its latest offensive, Israel called up what it said were \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of reservists to bolster its numbers in Gaza.Speaking after the announcement of the latest military attack on Gaza, Israel\u2019s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was clear in what he saw as the aims of the offensive, saying that, within months, Gaza would be \u201ctotally destroyed\u201d and what remains of its pre-war population of more than two million would be exiled to a narrow strip of land along the Egyptian border.However, despite the new offensive to recapture ground already largely destroyed by the Israeli military, dissent is gaining ground.Open letters protesting the war from military units and reservists publicly refusing to turn up for service are becoming more frequent. In April, more than a thousand of Israel\u2019s current and former pilots, generally regarded as an elite unit, wrote an open letter protesting a war they said served the \u201cpolitical and personal interests\u201d of Netanyahu, \u201cand not security ones\u201d.There are no official numbers for how many reservists have not turned up for duty. But, according to Israeli media reports, the number may be as high as 100,000. Those numbers are in addition to those refusing their initial period of mandatory military service.Most of those are \u201cgrey\u201d refusals, activists say. That is, people who gave no political reason for refusing to serve, officially refusing for other reasons, such as declining on medical grounds.But Sofia Orr, a 19-year-old from Pardes Hannah in northern Israel, is one of a growing number of conscripts refusing their mandatory service and making that refusal as public as possible.Orr refused to serve three times after first being called up on February 24, 2024. Her first and second refusals each netted her 20 days in military prison. Her third cost her 45 days.\u201cI\u2019d already decided to refuse when I was 15,\u201d Orr told Al Jazeera. \u201cI asked myself, \u2018If I go and serve in the military, what cause am I serving, does it align with my values, who am I actually helping?\u2019\u201d she said.\u201cIf I enlist, am I just entering the cycle of bloodshed that occupies and bloodily oppresses Palestinians daily?\u201d she said of defying what she described as hardwired societal expectations of Israeli life.\u201cI wanted to challenge that, so it wasn\u2019t just about refusing, but doing so as publicly and loudly as possible. I needed people to see it and know that we exist, that they could do the same, to bring Palestinian suffering into Israeli society and for Palestinians to see it and know they were not alone,\u201d she said.Orr is a member of \u201cMesarvot\u201d, an Israeli organisation that has been supporting conscientious objectors in the face of calls from prominent politicians for refusers to be arrested and prosecuted, including from cabinet member and former Israeli military spokesperson Miri Regev.\u201cThere\u2019s been a steady growth of refusers since October 7,\u201d Nimrod Flaschenberg, a political analyst and spokesperson for Mesarvot said, referring to the 2023 attack on southern Israel that led to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been seeing an exponential increase of 16-, 17-year-olds refusing to serve recently. There are around a hundred circulating an open letter, all refusing service and explaining why.\u201dOf the wider movement, Flaschenberg said, some refused to serve in a war they had come to regard as political, others because they felt it risked the lives of the captives and a minority out of revulsion for the mass killing in Gaza and the West Bank that they were being asked to participate in.\u201cThere\u2019s still an Israeli public taboo over showing any public sympathy for Palestinians,\u201d Flaschenberg said of the low prominence given to Gaza in the reasons given by most refusers, contrasting that with the widespread outrage that greeted ex-General and leader of Israel\u2019s Democrats party, Yair Golan, because he warned that Israel risked becoming regarded as a \u201cpariah state\u201d that killed Palestinian babies \u201cas a hobby\u201d if it didn\u2019t \u201creturn to sanity\u201d.\u201cThat really demonstrates the level of ignorance we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Flaschenberg said. \u201cOf course, Israel is killing babies, but Israelis just can\u2019t accept that.\u201dHowever, while growing international condemnation of Israel concentrates on vilifying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to Orr, it risks overlooking a harsher reality.\u201cFor many people here, it\u2019s Israelis who are the real victims, the first, the last and only victims in all of this,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t even see Palestinians as people, just as a threat.\u201dGreen, who immediately rejoined the protest on the Gaza border after his overnight release from house arrest was over, was equally fatalistic.\u201cI\u2019m not confident we\u2019ll succeed. The government has represented a minority of Israelis for around a year, and the war\u2019s continued,\u201d he said.But, despite that, he was not ready to give up on calling for Israelis to wake up.\u201cThings are already bad enough,\u201d Green added. \u201cWe\u2019ve destroyed nearly every building in Gaza, we\u2019ve killed 18,000 babies, and about 53,000 people. This is something we\u2019re going to have to live with.\u201d\u201cDo we really want to live with any more?\u201d"}

Her injunction is set to last for approximately two weeks, and she set hearing dates on May 27 and 29.Friday\u2019s lawsuit against the Trump administration is Harvard\u2019s second in less than two months.The latest is a response to a decision on Thursday announced by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Her department oversees the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, and she said she is revoking Harvard\u2019s privilege to use the system based on its failure to address Trump administration concerns.\u201cThis administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,\u201d she wrote on social media.The revocation means that Harvard can no longer accept foreign students. Those already enrolled will need to transfer to another school.The move represents a major escalation in Trump\u2019s pressure campaign against Harvard and other top US universities. He has accused schools of allowing anti-Semitism to fester, promoting \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d diversity programmes, and pushing ideological slants.But in Friday\u2019s lawsuit, Harvard called the Trump administration\u2019s actions a \u201cblatant violation\u201d of the US Constitution and other federal laws.Barring the prestigious Ivy League school from enrolling its international students would have an \u201cimmediate and devastating effect\u201d on the university and the more than 7,000 visa holders in its student body, it argued.\u201cWith the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard\u2019s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cWithout its international students, Harvard is not Harvard.\u201dTrump\u2019s current battle against higher education can be largely traced back to the pro-Palestine protests that broke out on US campuses last year, in response to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Trump made cracking down on the antiwar protests a centrepiece of his 2024 re-election campaign.While there have been instances of harassment from participants on both sides of the issue, protest organisers have rejected claims of widespread anti-Jewish sentiment. Some campus protests have even been spearheaded by Jewish students and organisations, including Jewish Voice for Peace.Earlier this year, task forces at Harvard itself issued two reports, warning about instances of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias, as well as anti-Semitism.Harvard has said it is working to address these concerns. Nevertheless, in April, Harvard became the latest school to receive a list of demands from the Trump administration.The list included reforming its hiring and admissions practices, refusing to admit students deemed \u201chostile to the American values and institutions\u201d, doing away with diversity programmes, and auditing academic programmes and centres, including several related to the Middle East.Harvard rejected the demands and immediately faced a freeze in $2.2bn in multi-year grants and $60m in multi-year contracts. Several federal agencies have since frozen tens of millions of dollars more in grants to Harvard.The university responded to Trump\u2019s funding freezes with a lawsuit in April, saying the administration was violating the First Amendment of the US Constitution with its \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d cuts.Trump has also floated revoking Harvard\u2019s tax exempt status, and in April, Noem sent a letter to Harvard first threatening to revoke its Student and Exchange Visitor Program approval if administrators did not send information on any foreign students\u2019 \u201cillegal and violent activities\u201d.At the end of April, Harvard said it had provided all legally required information, without providing further details.Friday\u2019s lawsuit seeks immediate relief from the Trump administration\u2019s decision to de-certify Harvard\u2019s ability to register foreign students, citing \u201cirreparable harm inflicted by this lawless action\u201d.In response to the complaint, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson accused the school of doing too little to address the Trump administration\u2019s concerns.\u201cIf only Harvard cared this much about ending the scourge of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators on their campus, they wouldn\u2019t be in this situation to begin with,\u201d Jackson said.\u201cHarvard should spend their time and resources on creating a safe campus environment instead of filing frivolous lawsuits,\u201d she added.In a letter to the Harvard community, school President Alan Garber framed Trump\u2019s attack on Harvard\u2019s foreign student body as part of \u201ca series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence\u201d.Garber described the de-certification as evidence of the \u201cfederal government\u2019s illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body\u201d.In its complaint, Harvard said the de-certification has thrown \u201ccountless\u201d academic programmes, clinics, courses and research laboratories into disarray.Harvard enrolled nearly 6,800 international students in its current school year, equal to 27 percent of its total enrolment.On Thursday, Noem also said Harvard could avoid the move if it turned over more information on foreign students, including video or audio of their protest activity over the past five years.Harvard has maintained it has already met the legal requirements in its disclosures."}

Since Monday\u2019s announcement, only 300 trucks have made it in, including Thursday\u2019s convoy, according to COGAT.Aid agencies also state that even the aid that is being allowed into Gaza is not reaching people.\u201cSignificant challenges in loading and dispatching goods remain due to insecurity, the risk of looting, delays in coordination approvals and inappropriate routes being provided by Israeli forces that are not viable for the movement of cargo,\u201d the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said.Hamas officials said on Friday that Israeli air strikes had killed at least six Palestinians guarding aid trucks against looters.An umbrella network of Palestinian aid groups said that just 119 aid trucks have entered Gaza since Israel eased its blockade on Monday, and that distribution has been hampered by looting, including by armed groups of men.\u201cThey stole food meant for children and families suffering from severe hunger,\u201d the network said in a statement.The UN\u2019s World Food Programme said on Friday that 15 of its trucks were looted in southern Gaza while en route to WFP-supported bakeries.Inside Gaza, the situation continues to deteriorate.Dr Ahmed al-Farrah of Nasser Hospital told Al Jazeera that the health system is overwhelmed.\u201cMost people now live off food scraps of what they had in stock,\u201d he said. \u201cI predict there will be many victims because of food insecurity.\u201dPalestinian Health Ministry officials said on Thursday that at least 29 children and elderly people have died in recent days from starvation-related causes, with thousands more at risk.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019s  spokesperson said aid is being distributed via UN mechanisms, but stressed the amount reaching Gaza \u201cis not enough\u201d.The leaders of Britain, France and Canada warned Israel on Monday their countries would take action, including possible sanctions, if Israel did not lift aid restrictions.\u201cThe Israeli Government\u2019s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable and risks breaching International Humanitarian Law,\u201d a joint statement released by the British government said.\u201cWe will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions,\u201d it added.In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office accused the trio of being \u201con the wrong side of history\u201d and \u201csupporting \u201cmass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers\u201d."}

Foreign students already enrolled at the college must now transfer to another school or lose their legal status in the US.The government\u2019s move, announced on Thursday, is the latest in escalating tensions between Harvard University and the Trump administration.Here is what we know about the move and its impact.In a letter to Harvard President Alan Garber, Homeland Security Secretary Noem announced that Harvard\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification would be revoked, \u201ceffective immediately\u201d.This means Harvard can no longer enrol any new students on \u201cF-\u201d or \u201cJ-\u201d visas which are typically required to attend a US university as a non-immigrant. Students already at Harvard on these visas will be required to transfer to another school if they want to remain in the US legally.Noem accused the university of \u201cfostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party\u201d.In an earlier letter on April 16, the DHS had threatened to revoke Harvard\u2019s eligibility to enrol international students unless it submits information on international students\u2019 disciplinary records and protest participation.Tensions have been mounting with Harvard since student protests against Israel\u2019s war on Gaza swept campuses last year.The Trump administration accused Harvard of creating an \u201cunsafe and hostile\u201d campus, specifically citing antisemitic incidents and a failure to curb \u201cpro-Hamas activism\u201d. Officials also criticised the university\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies as discriminatory, and raised suspicions over alleged ties to Chinese institutions, though no direct evidence has been made public.In April, the Trump administration froze nearly $2.3bn in federal funding to Harvard over what it claimed was its failure to tackle rampant anti-Semitism on campus.The administration announced the freeze after Harvard rejected a series of demands that it said would subject the university to undue government control, including that it accede to external audits of faculty and students to ensure \u201cviewpoint diversity\u201d. The DHS also demanded detailed records on international students, including any disciplinary actions and potential security concerns.In May, US Education Department Secretary Linda McMahon wrote to Harvard, saying the elite university had made a \u201cmockery\u201d of higher education and should no longer seek federal grants, \u201csince none will be provided\u201d.\u201cHarvard will cease to be a publicly funded institution, and can instead operate as a privately-funded institution, drawing on its colossal endowment, and raising money from its large base of wealthy alumni,\u201d McMahon wrote in the letter.Thursday\u2019s decision to revoke Harvard\u2019s SEVP certification is widely viewed as retaliation for the university\u2019s refusal to fully comply with the federal requests. It is unclear if the Trump administration will reinstate Harvard\u2019s SEVP certification if the university provides the requested information now.The US government has two main ways of barring a university from enrolling international students.First, it can revoke the school\u2019s SEVP certification which allows schools to accept foreign students. Without it, Harvard can no longer issue the Form I-20 document that students need to apply for F-1 or J-1 student visas. This is the step the government took on Thursday.Second, the government can deny student visas outright. The US Department of State reviews visa applications, and if a student says they\u2019re planning to attend a school that doesn\u2019t have SEVP certification \u2013 like Harvard now \u2013 their visa can be denied. That means students would not be allowed to enter the US to study at Harvard, even if they have already been accepted.The move to block enrolment of overseas students affects approximately 6,800 foreign students currently studying at Harvard, constituting about 27 percent of the total student body. These students must now find places to study at other universities in the US or risk having the leave the country.Overseas students at Harvard came from 146 countries as of September 2024. Students from China, Canada and India made up the largest number, collectively accounting for 40 percent of the international cohort.The number of foreign students at the university has risen by 26.75 percent over the past four years.F-1 students usually have 60 days, and J-1 students 30 days, to leave the US after completing their studies. However, if their student status is terminated due to a violation, they may have to leave immediately. In Harvard\u2019s case, it\u2019s unclear how much time international students will be given to transfer or depart.Most international students at Harvard pay full tuition, which is $59,320 for the 2024-25 academic year, either by making direct payments or via scholarships. Room and Board and other mandatory fees amount to an additional $27,606 per student. That makes a total of $86,926 per year.Precise revenue figures for Harvard are not publicly disclosed, but if all 6,800 foreign students are paying full tuition fees and extras, that would amount to just over $591m in annual revenues.International students also have a broader economic impact in the US. They contributed approximately $43.8bn to the US economy during the 2023 \u2013 2024 academic year through tuition and fees and living expenses, according to the NAFSA Association of International Educators.States with the largest economic activity derived from international students were California, New York, Massachusetts, Texas and Illinois.Harvard has pushed back against the DHS decision, calling the move both \u201cunlawful\u201d and \u201cdeeply damaging\u201d to its academic mission.In a public statement, the school said it is fully committed to supporting its global community. \u201cHarvard remains dedicated to supporting our international students and scholars, who contribute immensely to our learning environment,\u201d the statement said.The university\u2019s legal team is reportedly reviewing the implications of the government\u2019s actions and preparing for a possible lawsuit if the certification is not reinstated.In the meantime, Harvard has set up dedicated advisory resources to help students understand their rights and explore transfer options."}

Both were pronounced dead at the scene.Israeli embassy staff have said that the young couple were set to be engaged in the coming days.\u201cA young couple \u2014 at the beginning of their life\u2019s journey, about to be engaged, in another country \u2014 had their bodies removed in the cold of the night, in a foreign city, in a body bag. We are not going to tolerate that anymore,\u201d said Pirro, appearing to allude primarily to Lischinsky\u2019s foreign roots.\u201cThis is the kind of case that picks at old sores and old scars, because these kinds of cases remind us of what has happened in the past that we can never and must never forget.\u201dShe pointed out that the Wednesday night attack took place at a museum that includes one of Washington\u2019s oldest synagogues in the centre of the city.Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said that the suspect chanted, \u201cFree Palestine! Free Palestine!\u201d after the shooting. Rodriguez, who hailed from Chicago, appears to have identified himself to police and was arrested shortly after the shooting.An affidavit from the Federal Bureau of Investigation notes that Rodriguez told police, \u201cI did it for Palestine. I did it for Gaza.\u201dThe shooting, which has been widely condemned, comes as Israel faces growing global anger over its war on Gaza, where a blockade has left millions of Palestinians without food or basic supplies.Experts at human rights organisations and the United Nations have compared the war, which has killed at least 53,000 people, to ethnic cleansing and genocide.Since the war began on October 7, 2023, Jewish, Muslim and Arab communities have all reported upticks in harassment and racism.In the aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s shooting, officials spoke out against anti-Semitism, and the administration of President Donald Trump promised to pursue every legal avenue against the suspect.\u201cThe Department of Justice will be prosecuting the perpetrator responsible for this to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday. \u201cHatred has no place in the United States of America under President Donald Trump.\u201dShe went on to compare antiwar protests at US universities, which have been largely peaceful, to \u201c\u200aanti-Semitic illegal behaviour\u201d. Protest leaders, however, have largely disavowed anti-Jewish hate.In the wake of the shooting, one US Congress member told Fox News that the \u201cPalestinian cause\u201d was \u201cevil\u201d. Republican Representative Randy Fine continued by suggesting the Gaza war should end like World War II did, with the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.\u201cWe nuked the Japanese twice in order to get unconditional surrender,\u201d he said. \u201cThat needs to be the same here. There is something deeply, deeply wrong with this culture, and it needs to be defeated.\u201dSeparately, the Israeli government denounced the shooting as an attack against its state.\u201cWe are witness to the terrible cost of the antisemitism and wild incitement against the State of Israel,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement."}

He accuses Harvard of \u201cpushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting \u2018Sickness\u2019\u201d.April 16, 2025: The Department of Homeland Security calls on Harvard to turn over records on any foreign students\u2019 \u201cillegal and violent activities\u201d, while threatening to revoke the university\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor Program approval. The certification is required for it to enrol foreign students. Noem gives an April 30 deadline for this.April 21, 2025: Harvard files a lawsuit against the Trump administration, accusing it of violating the First Amendment of the US Constitution with \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d funding cuts.April 30, 2025: Harvard says it shared information requested by Noem regarding foreign students, but does not release the nature of the information provided.May 2, 2025: Trump again says the administration will take away Harvard\u2019s tax-exempt status. No action is immediately taken.May 5, 2025: The Trump administration says it is cutting all new federal grants to Harvard.May 13, 2025: The US Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announces another $450m in federal funding from eight federal agencies.May 19, 2025: The DOJ announces it will use the False Claims Act, typically used to punish federal funding recipients accused of corruption, to crack down on universities like Harvard over DEI policies. The Department of Health and Human Services also says it is terminating $60m in federal grants to Harvard.May 22, 2025: Noem announces revocation of Harvard\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor Program, blocking it from enrolling new foreign students and saying current students will need to transfer to continue their studies.Harvard responds: \u201cWe are fully committed to maintaining Harvard\u2019s ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the university \u2013 and this nation \u2013 immeasurably.\u201d"}
{"website": "aljazeera", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/22/israeli-speculation-mounts-over-potential-rift-between-trump-and-netanyahu", "title": "Israeli speculation mounts over potential rift between Trump and Netanyahu", "date": "22 May 2025", "media_type": "news", "link": null, "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has often tried to paint himself as a close friend of United States President Donald Trump, but the relationship has rarely been as straightforward as the Israeli premier has portrayed it.And recently, speculation across the Israeli media that the relationship between the two leaders, and by extension, their countries, has begun to unravel is becoming unavoidable.Some idea of the gap was apparent in Trump\u2019s recent Middle East trip, which saw him visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates but not Israel, the state that has typically been the US\u2019s closest ally within the region.Likewise, US negotiations with two of Israel\u2019s fiercest regional opponents, Iran and the Houthi rebels in Yemen, have been taking place without any apparent input from Israel, a country that has always regarded itself as central to such matters. Lastly, against a growing chorus of international condemnation over Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, there was the decision of US Vice President JD Vance to cancel a planned visit to Israel for apparently \u201clogistical\u201d reasons.Appearing on national television earlier this month, Israeli commentator Dana Fahn Luzon put it succinctly: \u201cTrump is signalling to Netanyahu, \u2018Honey, I\u2019ve had enough of you.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a total breakdown of everything that might be of benefit to Israel,\u201d Mitchell Barak, an Israeli pollster and former political aide to several senior Israeli political figures, including Netanyahu, told Al Jazeera. \u201cAmerica was once our closest ally; now we don\u2019t seem to have a seat at the table. This should be of concern to every single Israeli.\u201d\u2018Many Israelis blame Netanyahu for this,\u201d Barak continued. \u201cHe always presented Trump as somehow being in his pocket, and it\u2019s pretty clear Trump didn\u2019t like that. Netanyahu crossed a line.\u201dWhile concern over a potential rift may be growing within Israel, prominent voices in the US administration are stressing the strength of their alliance.Last Sunday, President Trump\u2019s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said that, while the US was keen to avert what he called a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d in Gaza, he didn\u2019t think there was \u201cany daylight between President Trump\u2019s position and Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s position\u201d.Also doubling down on the US\u2019s commitment to Israel was White House National Security Council spokesperson James Hewitt, who dismissed reports that the Trump administration was preparing to \u201cabandon\u201d Israel if it continues with its war on Gaza, telling Israeli media that \u201cIsrael has had no better friend in its history than President Trump\u201d.The Trump administration has also been active in shutting down criticism of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza in public spheres and specifically on US college campuses.Several international students have also been arrested and deported for their support of Palestine, including Rumeysa Ozturk, whose arrest as she was walking on a street in a Boston suburb for an opinion piece co-authored in a student newspaper was described by Human Rights Watch as \u201cchilling\u201d.Those policies have made it clear that the Trump administration sits firmly in Israel\u2019s corner. And looking back at Trump\u2019s policies in his first presidential term, that is not surprising.Trump fulfilled many of the Israeli right\u2019s dreams in that term, between 2017 and 2021, including recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, despite its eastern half being occupied Palestinian territory, recognising the annexation of the Golan Heights, despite it being occupied Syrian territory, and pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal.But those actions are partly to blame for the bumpy relationship between Trump and Netanyahu, with the US president reportedly resentful of what he saw as a lack of gratitude for those pro-Israel policies.Trump was also furious after Netanyahu congratulated former US President Joe Biden following his 2020 election victory over Trump, which the current president still disputes.\u201cThe first person that congratulated [Biden] was Bibi [Benjamin] Netanyahu, the man that I did more for than any other person I dealt with. \u2026 Bibi could have stayed quiet. He has made a terrible mistake,\u201d Trump said in an interview in 2021.Nevertheless, in the build-up to the 2024 US election, Netanyahu and his allies actively courted candidate Trump, believing him to be the best means of fulfilling their agenda and continuing their war on Gaza, analysts said.\u201cNetanyahu had really campaigned for Trump before the election, emphasising how bad Biden was,\u201d Yossi Mekelberg, an Associate Fellow at Chatham House, said.\u201cNow they don\u2019t know which way Trump\u2019s going to go because he\u2019s so contractual. He\u2019s all about the win,\u201d Mekelberg added, referring to the series of victories the president claimed during his recent Gulf tour, adding, \u201cbut there\u2019s no win in Palestine\u201d.Across the Israeli press and media, a consensus is taking hold that Trump has simply tired of trying to secure a \u201cwin\u201d or an end to the war on Gaza that Netanyahu and his allies on the Israeli hard right have no interest in pursuing.Israeli Army Radio has even carried reports that Trump has blocked direct contact from Netanyahu over concerns that the Israeli prime minister may be trying to manipulate him.Quoting an unnamed Israeli official, Yanir Cozin, a reporter with Israeli Army Radio, wrote on X: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing Trump hates more than being portrayed as a sucker and someone being played, so he decided to cut off contact.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a sense in Israel that Trump\u2019s turned on Netanyahu,\u201d political analyst Nimrod Flaschenberg said from Tel Aviv. \u201cSupporters of Netanyahu are panicking, as they all previously thought that Trump\u2019s backing was unlimited.\u201dA break in relations between Netanyahu and Trump might not mean an automatic break between Israel and the US, Flaschenberg cautioned, with all factions across the Israeli political spectrum speculating on what the future may hold under a realigned relationship with the US.US financial, military and diplomatic support for Israel has been a bedrock of both countries\u2019 foreign policy for decades, Mekelberg said. Moreover, whatever Trump\u2019s current misgivings about his relationship with Netanyahu, support for Israel, while diminishing, remains hardwired into much of his Republican base, analysts and polls have noted, and particularly among Republican \u2013 and Democratic \u2013 donors.\u201cThose opposed to Netanyahu and the war are hoping that the US may now apply a lasting ceasefire,\u201d Flaschenberg said, with reference to Israeli reliance upon US patronage. \u201cThat\u2019s not because of any great faith in Trump, but more the extent of their dismay in the current government.\u201dHowever, equally present are those on the hard right, such as Israel\u2019s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who Mekelberg speculated may also hope to take advantage of whatever direction US policy towards Israel heads in.\u201cBen-Gvir, Smotrich and their backers could take advantage of American disinterest, depending upon what shape it takes,\u201d Mekelberg told Al Jazeera. \u201cIf the US continues to provide weapons and diplomatic cover in the UN while letting [Israel] get on with it, then that\u2019s their dream,\u201d he said of Smotrich, who has reassured his backers that allowing minimal aid into the besieged enclave did not mean that Israel would stop \u201cdestroying everything that\u2019s left of the Gaza Strip\u201d.However, where Netanyahu may figure in this is uncertain.Accusations that the Israeli prime minister has become reliant upon the war to sustain the political coalition he needs to remain in office and avoid both a legal reckoning in his corruption trial, as well as a political reckoning over his government\u2019s failures ahead of the October 7, 2023 attack, are both widespread and longstanding.\u201cI don\u2019t know if Netanyahu can come back from this,\u201d Barak said, still uncertain about whether the prime minister can demonstrate his survival skills once again. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Netanyahu being at the end of his line. I don\u2019t know. They\u2019ve been saying that for years, and he\u2019s still here. They were saying that when I was his aide, but I can\u2019t see any more magic tricks that are available to him.\u201d"}

It refused.\u201dIn a letter to the university\u2019s administration, Noem said the university\u2019s Student Exchange Visitor Program certification has been revoked. The programme is overseen by the US Homeland Security Investigations unit, which falls under the agency Noem leads.The move means that not only will Harvard not be able to accept foreign students on its campus, but current students will need to \u201ctransfer to another university in order to maintain their non-immigrant status\u201d, the letter said.In a statement, Harvard called the move \u201cunlawful\u201d and a \u201cretaliatory action\u201d.\u201cWe are fully committed to maintaining Harvard\u2019s ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the university \u2013 and this nation \u2013 immeasurably,\u201d the university said.The action marks an escalation amid a wider standoff between the university \u2013 which has refused to agree to a list of demands related to its diversity programmes and response to pro-Palestine protests \u2013 and the Trump administration.The administration has responded with three rounds of federal funding and grant cuts, totalling more than $2.6bn. The most recent was on Monday. Harvard is currently pursuing a lawsuit accusing the administration of defying the US Constitution in its actions.Earlier this week, Harvard President Alan Garber called on alumni to throw their support \u2013 and donations \u2013 behind the university.\u201cThe institution entrusted to us now faces challenges unlike any others in our long history,\u201d Garber wrote in an email, in which he launched the Presidential Priorities Fund and the Presidential Fund for Research. Both funds are meant to address gaps left by the funding cuts.According to immigration lawyer Leon Fresco, the move by the Trump administration would be a financial blow for the school and a \u201cmajor problem\u201d for the students.\u201cIf the foreign students cannot attend the university, they get their tuition payments back that they\u2019ve already paid to the university for this upcoming semester,\u201d he told Al Jazeera, adding that Harvard was relying on that money for the coming year.Fresco noted that there is a clear legal recourse to fight against the revocation of its foreign exchange programme.\u201cThe revocation regulation is very specific \u2013 there has to be a notice of intention to revoke that is given. There has to be reasons related to non-compliance with the student exchange visitor program,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a politically ideologically based revocation, that doesn\u2019t exist in the regulations.\u201dNoem, in April, first threatened to revoke Harvard\u2019s Student Exchange Visitor Program certification, which is required by educational institutions to host students on several visa types.She gave the university administration an April 30 deadline to provide detailed records on what she called the \u201cillegal and violent activities\u201d of foreign students on campus, pointing to a federal law that requires disclosures of academics, enrolment and disciplinary action.The university later said it had provided the requested information to the agency, the Harvard Crimson reported, although it did not reveal further details.The threat came amid a wider crackdown by the Trump administration on pro-Palestine protests at universities across the US, which federal officials have broadly portrayed as \u201canti-Semitic\u201d, a label rejected by organisers,  Al Jazeera\u2019s Kimberly Halkett reported.\u201cThe Trump administration has been clamping down hard on Harvard and other colleges, including Columbia University, over what the administration says is \u2018anti-Semitism\u2019 that exists on the campuses, and that really seems to be the spark that kind of ignited this,\u201d Halkett reported from Washington, DC.\u201cThe president put in place a joint task force at the start of his administration to address this, but opponents say this task force evolved to include everything from clamping down on hiring practices to curriculum changes at universities,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump himself has accused universities of fomenting \u2018anti-Trump\u2019 ideology.\u201dThere were 7,417 total schools approved for the Student Exchange Visitor Program in the US in 2023, according to federal data. The agency maintains that under federal law, it can review approved schools at any time."}

The violations in question, Van Der Hout said, include the lack of a warrant at the time of the arrest and claims that Khalil proved to be a flight risk.The hearing could be the most consequential turn yet in a series of cases in which US students have challenged being targeted by the Trump administration for their pro-Palestine advocacy or statements. It comes after three other students \u2013 Rumeysa Ozturk, Mohsen Mahdawi, and Badar Khan Suri \u2013 successfully challenged their detentions.Ozturk, Mahdawi, and Khan Suri have since been ordered released on bail as their parallel challenges in federal court and their deportation cases in immigration court proceed. Lawyers for the students say their rights, including freedom of speech, have been violated by the Trump administration.Despite Khalil also challenging his arrest in a federal case in New Jersey, a judge there has yet to make a ruling on whether he should be released. He has remained in detention in Louisiana.Khalil\u2019s lawyers have accused the Trump administration of trying to slow roll his federal challenge to his arrest and detention, while fast-tracking the immigration proceedings. Judges in immigration courts, which fall under the executive branch, are typically viewed as less independent than life-tenured federal district judges.\u201cThe bigger picture is that the government would like to slow down Mahmoud\u2019s habeas corpus case in federal court before an independent judge who has life tenure,\u201d Ramzi Kassem, a lawyer with the City University of New York\u2019s Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility (CLEAR) project, told reporters.\u201cAnd they\u2019d like to accelerate as much as possible these immigration proceedings, as they have so far, in front of a government employee who is subject to government pressure,\u201d he said.Immigration Judge Jamee Comans had previously sided with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s claim that Khalil is deportable under an obscure provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act because his presence in the US poses \u201cadverse foreign policy consequences\u201d.Rubio has broadly portrayed Khalil\u2019s involvement in pro-Palestine protests at Columbia University as \u201canti-Semitic\u201d, but has not provided any further evidence to the court supporting the claim.Khalil and his legal team have firmly denied that his advocacy contained any anti-Jewish sentiment, and no evidence of such conduct has emerged.Thursday\u2019s hearing not hinge on the government\u2019s motivation for targeting Khalil, but instead focus on procedural missteps by immigration agents.Those agents had initially claimed that they had a warrant to detain Khalil when they confronted him in the lobby of his Manhattan apartment building. They later admitted they did not have a warrant, but arrested Khalil because they said his actions and statements indicated he was a flight risk.Surveillance footage of the encounter contradicts that statement, Khalil\u2019s lawyers maintain.\u201cWe filed, over the last probably 48 hours, new evidence, including a video surveillance from Columbia that we got through a subpoena that clearly shows there was no attempt to flee whatsoever,\u201d Van Der Hout said.Lawyers for Khalil also separately argued that he is eligible for asylum. They say the unfounded claims made by the Trump administration that Khalil is a \u201cHamas supporter\u201d would put him at risk if he were to be deported to his birthplace of Syria, or to Algeria, where he has citizenship.Ahead of the hearing, officials from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) denied a meeting between Khalil, his wife, Noor Abdalla, and their son, who was born while Khalil remained in detention.A federal judge later ordered that Khalil must be allowed an in-person meeting with his wife, with Khalil holding his son for the first time on Thursday."}

More essential food is needed to push back the risk of famine. Bread alone is not enough for people to survive,\u201d the agency said in a post on X. The president of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), Younis al-Khatib, had earlier said many Palestinians had yet to receive any supplies so far. \u201cNo civilian has received anything yet,\u201d al-Khatib told reporters.He said most of the aid trucks are still at the Karem Abu Salem crossing, known as Kerem Shalom to Israelis, in southern Gaza.As limited deliveries enter the Strip, the Israeli military has continued to launch attacks across the enclave, with medical sources telling Al Jazeera that at least 51 Palestinians have been killed since dawn on Thursday.At least 53,655 Palestinians have been killed and more than 121,000 others injured since Israel\u2019s war on Gaza began in October 2023, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee also announced new forced evacuation orders for Palestinians in Jabalia and Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza. He said in a post on X that the army will \u201csignificantly expand its military activity\u201d in the area.Reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum said that while Palestinians have welcomed the influx of aid, it is a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d compared with the population\u2019s needs.\u201cFive hundred aid trucks are needed on a daily basis in order to avert the current food crisis in the territory,\u201d Abu Azzoum explained.Still, Gaza resident Ahmed Abed al-Daym said the aid trucks were a \u201cpositive sign\u201d amid dire conditions.\u201cOur homes are empty \u2013 there is no bread, and our children are going hungry,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\u201cIn many households, bread has completely disappeared. What people urgently need is a steady and sufficient flow of flour and other essentials. Unfortunately, the limited aid that has entered so far falls far short of meeting our needs.\u201dAnother resident, Reem Zidiah, said that due to the mass starvation that Gaza is enduring, no one is safe in the besieged enclave.\u201cAll of us here in Gaza, we don\u2019t think about tomorrow because we don\u2019t know what will happen tomorrow \u2013 whether we\u2019re going to live or die,\u201d Zidiah told Al Jazeera.Meanwhile, Action Against Hunger teams on the ground in southern Gaza warned that there was less than a seven-days\u2019 supply of food to prevent acute malnutrition in children.Natalia Anguera, the humanitarian group\u2019s head of Middle East operations, said \u201cflour has come in and some bakeries in the south have resumed operations\u201d.However, she stressed that \u201cspecific nutritional supplies reserves for children under five are about to run out\u201d."}

At least 53,655 have been killed since Israel launched its assault on Gaza in October 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities."}

On Thursday, he appeared in court in Washington, DC, for his arraignment. A preliminary hearing has been set for June 18. Rodriguez is the only suspect.President Donald Trump condemned the shooting as \u201chorrible\u201d, stating there was no place for \u201chatred\u201d in the US. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by what had unfolded in the US capital.\u201cThis is a despicable act of hatred, of anti-Semitism, which has claimed the lives of two young employees of the Israeli embassy,\u201d he said.Kristi Noem, secretary of Homeland Security, said federal authorities were investigating the incident and would bring its \u201cdepraved perpetrator\u201d to justice. Jeanine Pirro, the interim US attorney for Washington, DC, said the killings were being investigated as a \u201chate crime and a crime of terrorism\u201d.Here is what we know so far:Officers responded to multiple calls about a shooting near the Capital Jewish Museum at about 9pm on Wednesday (01:00 GMT Thursday).The victims, a man and a woman, were leaving an event at the museum, which is in the area of 3rd and F streets in Northwest, Washington, DC, close to an FBI field office and the US attorney general\u2019s office, when the suspect approached a group of four people and opened fire, Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said at a news conference.First responders found the victims unconscious and not breathing. Despite life-saving efforts, both were pronounced dead.According to police, the suspect entered the museum after the shooting and was detained by security personnel at the event.\u201cOnce in handcuffs, the suspect identified where he discarded the weapon, and that weapon has been recovered, and he implied that he committed the offence,\u201d Smith said.The two were named by the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim.Lischinsky was Israeli. A German diplomatic source told the AFP news agency that Lischinsky also held a German passport.Milgrim was an American citizen. Both worked at the Israeli embassy.The Israeli ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, told reporters the young staffers were a couple \u201cabout to be engaged\u201d.\u201cThe young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem,\u201d Leiter revealed.The suspect has been identified as 31-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, Illinois. Following his arrest, his home was searched by police.Rodriguez has been charged with two counts of murder, causing death with a firearm and discharging a firearm in a crime of violence.Jeanine Pirro, the interim US Attorney who was recently appointed by President Donald Trump as federal prosecutor in Washington, told reporters the charges against Ridriguez constitute a \u201cdeath penalty-eligible case\u201d.\u201cWe are going to continue to investigate this as a hate crime and as a crime of terrorism,\u201d Pirro said.Reporting from close to the site of the shooting, Al Jazeera\u2019s Heidi Zhou-Castro said the suspect was not previously on the radar of local authorities.\u201cHe was not a known entity. There was no heightened alert prior to this happening,\u201d she said.So far, the police have not confirmed any motive.Speaking on Thursday, Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, blamed a \u201ctoxic anti-Semitic incitement against Israel and Jews around the world\u201d since the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023.When the suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was taken into custody, he began chanting: \u201cFree, free Palestine,\u201d Police Chief Smith said.Mohamad Elmasry, professor of media studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, said the attacks were \u201cawful\u201d and were rightfully being condemned regardless of political ideology.He said: \u201cYou have the Trump administration, Israel and some of their supporters coming out and saying that this is an act of anti-Semitism \u2026 and that could be the case, that it is just an act of naked anti-Jewish hatred, which obviously should be condemned,\u201d Elmasry told Al Jazeera.\u201cBut it\u2019s also possible that Mr Rodriguez carried this act of vigilante violence out against the State of Israel, or that he\u2019s taking out his frustrations over the genocide [in Gaza] or Israel\u2019s apartheid policies, on these embassy staffers. That\u2019s an important distinction, because if that\u2019s the motive, then it requires a different course of action.\u201d\u201cThese horrible DC killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW!\u201d President Trump posted on social media early Thursday.\u201cHatred and radicalism have no place in the USA. Condolences to the families of the victims. So sad that such things as this can happen! God bless you all!\u201dLater, Trump\u2019s Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated the president\u2019s outrage and warned of dire consequences.\u201cThe evil of anti-Semitism must be eradicated from our society,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Department of Justice will be prosecuting the perpetrator responsible for this to the fullest extent of the law.\u201dShe also tied the shooting to Trump\u2019s crackdown on anti-Semitism, which has largely focused on antiwar student protesters demonstrating against Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.\u201cSecretary of State Marco Rubio has revoked thousands of student visas from campuses where these pro-Hamas terrorist campus agitators and violent protests took place,\u201d Leavitt explained.\u201cWe\u2019ve also withheld funding from those varied campuses as well in an effort to combat anti-Semitism. So the president has made it very clear that such hatred will have no place in our country.\u201dIsraeli officials also strongly condemned the incident, describing it as a \u201cdespicable act of hatred\u201d. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after the shooting: \u201cWe are witnessing the terrible price of anti-Semitism and the wild incitement against the State of Israel.\u201cI have instructed to enhance security arrangements at Israeli missions around the world and to increase protection for state representatives,\u201d Netanyahu said.On Thursday, reactions and condolences poured in from other countries as well.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called the shooting a \u201cheinous act\u201d in a post on X, adding that at the moment \u201cwe must assume there was an anti-Semitic motive\u201d.Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, said: \u201cShocked by the shooting of two Israeli embassy staff in Washington DC. There is and should be no place in our societies for hatred, extremism, or antisemitism. I extend my condolences to the families of the victims and the people of Israel.\u201dIn the United Kingdom, Foreign Secretary of State David Lammy said: \u201cHorrified by the killing of two Israeli Embassy staff in DC. We condemn this appalling, antisemitic crime. Our thoughts are with the victims, their families and colleagues at this awful time.\u201dFrance\u2019s foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: \u201cThe murder of two members of the Israeli embassy near the Jewish Museum in Washington is an abhorrent act of antisemitic barbarity. Nothing can justify such violence. My thoughts go to their loved ones, their colleagues, and the State of Israel.\u201dIn Ireland, the prime minister, Micheal Martin, said: \u201cI strongly condemn the horrific gun attack that killed two Israeli embassy staff in Washington DC last night. My deepest sympathies go to the family and friends of the couple, and the Israeli people.

Scenes of terror and violence to be strongly condemned. antisemitism born of hatred against Jews must be stopped, the horrors of the past can never return.\u201dOn Thursday, federal prosecutors announced an opening volley of charges against the suspect, Rodriguez, with promises to potentially unveil more.Rodriguez was charged with first-degree murder, murdering foreign officials, causing death with a firearm and discharging a firearm in a crime of violence.Pirro, a former Fox News host whom Trump only recently appointed as the interim US attorney for the District of Columbia, said that Rodriguez could face further charges in coming days.\u201cThis is a horrific crime, and these crimes are not going to be tolerated by me and by this office,\u201d Pirro said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to investigate this as a hate crime and a crime of terrorism, and we will add additional charges as the evidence warrants.\u201dInvestigations continue into Rodriguez\u2019s background and motives. Police cordoned off his home in Chicago, Illinois, as their probe continues.Police Chief Smith said law enforcement did not believe there was an ongoing threat to the community at present.FBI Director Kash Patel said he and his team had been briefed on the shooting.\u201cWhile we\u2019re working with [the Metropolitan Police Department] to respond and learn more, in the immediate, please pray for the victims and their families,\u201d he wrote on X.Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters her administration would not tolerate \u201cviolence or hate in our city\u201d.\u201cWe will not tolerate any acts of terrorism, and we\u2019re going to stand together as a community in the coming days and weeks to send a clear message that we will not tolerate anti-Semitism,\u201d Bowser said.Across the Atlantic, in France, the country\u2019s interior minister told police to \u201cstep up surveillance at sites linked to the Jewish community\u201d. Security measures must be \u201cvisible and dissuasive\u201d, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said in a message seen by AFP news agency.Saar said that Israeli flags at the ministry headquarters and at missions around the world would be flown at half-mast on Thursday.The shooting comes as Israel has launched a new military campaign in Gaza to control all of the Strip while continuing to impose an 11-week aid blockade that has been widely condemned.Many world leaders, including allies, have demanded that Israel end the war and let aid into the war-ravaged territory or face punitive actions."}

We expect a full investigation and we expect an immediate explanation of what happened. It\u2019s totally unacceptable, it\u2019s some of many things that are totally unacceptable that\u2019s going on in the region.We demand the launch of a full investigation so that similar incidents do not happen again.Today\u2019s events in Jenin are unacceptable. I have spoken to our diplomats who were affected. Civilians must always be protected, and diplomats allowed to do their jobs. There must be a full investigation, and those responsible should be held accountable.I am deeply shocked and horrified that the [Israeli forces] today opened fire on a group of diplomats visiting the town of Jenin. Thankfully, nobody was killed or injured.I unreservedly condemn this aggressive, intimidatory and violent act. This is not and must never be a normal way to behave.We ask the government of Israel to immediately clarify what happened. The threats against diplomats are unacceptable.Diplomats should be able to do their work, and threatening them is unacceptable. I have called the Dutch representative in the Palestinian territories and our ambassador to Israel and am relieved that the delegation is unharmed. We condemn the shooting, have requested clarification from the Israeli authorities and are considering further steps.A visit to Jenin, in which one of our diplomats was participating, was fired upon by Israeli soldiers. This is unacceptable. The Israeli ambassador will be summoned to explain. Full support to our agents on site and their remarkable work in trying conditions.This is a very serious and condemnable incident. I have spoken with the Finnish diplomat who was present at the situation. We demand an explanation from Israel about the situation.It is unacceptable that Israel has fired shots near foreign diplomats. It has no place anywhere and is completely unacceptable.The Danish head of mission in Ramallah was among the diplomats and is fortunately safe. In light of the seriousness of the situation, I have asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to summon the Israeli ambassador so that we can get an official explanation.I was shocked to learn that the Israeli army opened fire on 20 diplomats today, including a Belgian colleague. Fortunately, he is fine. These diplomats were on an official visit to Jenin, coordinated with the Israeli army, in a convoy of 20 clearly recognisable vehicles. Belgium is asking Israel for a convincing explanation.I condemn the attacks by [the Israeli military] against a group of diplomats in Jenin today. Diplomatic and consular staff enjoy a special status under international law and must be protected. These actions constitute a clear violation of international law and are deeply unacceptable.Portugal condemns the attack by the Israeli army on the diplomatic delegation in the Jenin refugee camp, West Bank. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs \u2026 expressed its solidarity with the Portuguese ambassador who was part of the delegation and will take the appropriate diplomatic measures.The Federal Foreign Office strongly condemns this unprovoked fire. We can count ourselves lucky that nothing more serious occurred.The group was travelling in the West Bank in the course of its diplomatic work and in coordination with the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli army. The role of diplomats as independent observers on the ground is indispensable and in no way represents a threat to Israeli security interests.The Israeli government must immediately investigate the circumstances and respect the inviolability of diplomats.Slovenia joins EU partners in condemning the gunfire that threatened foreign diplomats at Jenin camp.Such intimidation violates the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations and is utterly unacceptable. We expect a prompt, transparent Israeli investigation, full accountability and guarantees of safe, unhindered access for all diplomatic missions.This is a clear violation of international law and international humanitarian law, and a crime that contravenes all diplomatic norms.The Ministry\u2019s official spokesperson, Ambassador Dr Sufyan Qudah, affirmed the kingdom\u2019s absolute rejection and strong condemnation of this targeting, which constitutes a violation of diplomatic agreements and norms, particularly the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which defines the procedures and controls governing diplomatic work and grants immunities to diplomatic missions.The state of Qatar strongly condemns the Israeli occupation forces for opening fire on an international diplomatic delegation during its visit to the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, and considered as a violation of international laws, conventions, and diplomatic norms.We condemn in the strongest terms the opening of fire by Israeli soldiers on a group of diplomats, including an official from the Turkish Consulate General in Jerusalem, during their visit to the city of Jenin.This attack, which endangered the lives of diplomats, is yet another demonstration of Israel\u2019s systematic disregard for international law and human rights. The targeting of diplomats constitutes a grave threat not only to individual safety but also to the mutual respect and trust that form the foundation of inter-state relations.The Arab Republic of Egypt emphasises its absolute rejection of this incident, which violates all diplomatic norms, and calls upon the Israeli side to provide the necessary clarifications regarding the circumstances of this incident.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has summoned the Israeli ambassador in Montevideo to clarify the incident.Uruguay urges the Israeli government to investigate this incident and take the necessary measures to ensure the protection and allow the operations of diplomatic personnel accredited to the State of Palestine.The Israeli military justified the action by stating that the diplomatic delegation had invaded an \u2018unauthorised area\u2019. However, there is no record of this occurring or of any officer approaching the delegation to verbally warn them in a timely manner.What happened violates the provisions of Article 29 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which establishes the inviolability of diplomatic agents. All States Parties to the aforementioned Convention, including Israel, are obliged to respect it.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will request the Israeli embassy in Mexico to provide the clarifications warranted by the case."}

This is the first time Trump\u2019s plan has been mentioned by Netanyahu as one of the conditions to halt fighting. Multiple nations and rights groups have called the plan ethnic cleansing.Netanyahu said Israel should avoid a \u201chumanitarian crisis to preserve our freedom of operational action\u201d, referring to Israel\u2019s decision to allow a very limited number of humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza. He also referenced a much-criticised plan \u201cdeveloped with the US\u201d to distribute food in the enclave without Hamas taking control of it. The Palestinian group denies it takes aid. Israel has come under international pressure to halt its punishing total blockade on Gaza, which had prevented any food or aid trucks from entering the territory since March 2.That has exacerbated the already dire humanitarian catastrophe inside the enclave. A United Nations-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification assessment found more than 93 percent of children in Gaza, or about 930,000, are on the brink of famine.On Wednesday, the Israeli army said it allowed 100 aid trucks carrying flour, baby food and medical equipment into Gaza. Yet UN officials said distribution problems had meant no aid had so far reached people in need.\u201cThe limited supplies finally being allowed to enter Kerem Shalom [in Arabic, the Karem Abu Salem border crossing] are nowhere near enough to meet the needs in Gaza, which are vast, which are tremendous. Much, much more aid needs to get in,\u201d said Stephane Dujarric, the UN chief\u2019s spokesperson.Aid groups have said the amount of aid that Israel is allowing is not nearly enough, calling Netanyahu\u2019s efforts a \u201csmokescreen to pretend the siege is over\u201d.\u201cThe Israeli authorities\u2019 decision to allow a ridiculously inadequate amount of aid into Gaza after months of an air-tight siege signals their intention to avoid the accusation of starving people in Gaza while, in fact, keeping them barely surviving,\u201d said Pascale Coissard, the emergency coordinator in Khan Younis for Doctors Without Borders.Critics were swift in reacting to Netanyahu\u2019s news conference. His \u201cwords today mean the occupation of Gaza for many years and waking up every day to the death of soldiers\u201d, opposition leader Yair Lapid said, adding that the country\u2019s international standing would collapse and the economy would be severely damaged.\u201cI saw a presentation by a pressured, obsessed, lying man who takes no responsibility for anything,\u201d the Democrats party leader Yair Golan said after the news conference. \u201cI will sue you for defamation because of the lies you spread about me, and we will defeat you in the elections very soon and send you to the pages of history.\u201dNetanyahu had slammed Golan on Tuesday after the opposition leader had said, \u201cA sane country \u2026 does not kill babies as a hobby.\u201d Netanyahu called the comment \u201cappalling\u201d."}

The band says they have been targets of a smear campaign for calling out Israel\u2019s genocidal war.KNEECAP STATEMENT:Since our statements at Coachella \u2014 exposing the ongoing genocide against the Palestinian people \u2014 we have faced a coordinated smear campaign.For over a year, we have used our shows to call out the British and Irish governments' complicity in war crimes.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/mBojb5QBOP\u2014 KNEECAP (@KNEECAPCEOL) April 25, 2025The Belfast trio is also well known for its political and satirical lyrics and use of symbolism associated with the Irish Republican movement, which seeks to unite Northern Ireland, currently part of the UK, with the Republic of Ireland.More than 3,600 people were killed during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland during \u201cThe Troubles\u201d involving the Irish Republican Army (IRA), pro-British Loyalist militias and the UK security forces.Kneecap takes its name from a brutal punishment, which involved being shot in the kneecaps, that was meted out by paramilitary groups to informers and drug dealers.The band has been praised for invigorating the Irish-language cultural scene in Northern Ireland, where the status of the language remains a contested political issue in a society still split between Protestant British Unionists and Catholic Irish Nationalist communities.It has also been criticised for lyrics laden with expletives and drug references.Kneecap came under intense scrutiny and criticism last month during their performance at the music festival Coachella in California when they projected the words \u201cF*** Israel. Free Palestine.\u201d on stage.\u201cThe Irish not so long ago were persecuted by the Brits, but we were never bombed from the f****** skies with nowhere to go! The Palestinians have nowhere to go \u2013 it\u2019s their f****** home and they\u2019re bombing them from the sky. If you\u2019re not calling it a genocide what the f*** are you calling it?\u201d said Mo Chara while on stage.Kneecap came under renewed scrutiny at the start of this month when UK intelligence said they would investigate comments made by the rap group about UK and Middle East politics.They were reported to police over footage from a 2024 concert in which a band member appeared to say: \u201cThe only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.\u201d Footage from another concert, in 2023, appears to show a member of the trio shouting \u201cUp Hamas, Up Hezbollah\u201d \u2013 the UK considers both to be \u201cterrorist\u201d organisations.In response, Kneecap said it had \u201cnever supported Hamas or Hezbollah,\u201d and accused \u201cestablishment figures\u201d of taking comments out of context to \u201cmanufacture moral hysteria\u201d because of the band\u2019s criticism of Israel\u2019s attacks on Palestinians in Gaza.Several Kneecap gigs have been cancelled as a result of the controversy, and some British lawmakers have called on organisers of June\u2019s Glastonbury Festival to scrap a planned performance by the group."}

But Bar said Netanyahu\u2019s decision was motivated by a series of events between November 2024 and February 2025.In the unclassified part of the court submission, Bar said Netanyahu had told him \u201con more than one occasion\u201d that he expected Shin Bet to take action against Israelis involved in anti-government demonstrations, \u201cwith a particular focus on monitoring the protests\u2019 financial backers\u201d.The Shin Bet head also said he had refused to sign off on a security request aimed at relieving Netanyahu from testifying at an ongoing corruption trial in which he faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of public trust.The court said the decision to dismiss Bar was made without \u201ca factual basis\u201d and without giving him a formal hearing before firing him, according to a report by the Times of Israel.Wednesday\u2019s ruling noted \u201cirregularities\u201d in the process that led to Bar\u2019s sacking, as well as \u201ca disregard for fundamental principles regarding internal security.\u201dThe Israeli cabinet voted to dismiss Bar in March, triggering mass protests and accusations of autocratic pursuits by the far-right government.The High Court of Justice halted the decision until a hearing could be held. Several groups, including opposition politicians, had filed petitions with the court against the government\u2019s decision.In April, the government revoked the decision to fire Bar a day after he said he would step down.Following Bar\u2019s decision to quit the job, Wednesday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling said that \u201cthis announcement puts an end to the [legal] procedure.\u201d"}

Israel\u2019s ambassador to Italy will be summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation to explain.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said firing even warning shots was unacceptable.

The rest of the population is, according to the UN\u2019s Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), suffering from high levels of acute food insecurity.Since yesterday, a few trucks of delivery aid managed to enter #Gaza but @UNReliefChief says they are 'a drop in the ocean of what\u2019s required'.https://t.co/7H98MUwSqR@UN_Spokesperson briefing the press \u2935\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/fWzb7lg5U4\u2014 UN News (@UN_News_Centre) May 21, 2025\u201cThe risk of famine in the Gaza Strip is not just possible \u2013 it is increasingly likely,\u201d  the IPC said, warning that an official famine could be declared as a direct result of Israeli action at any point between now and September.Officially, a famine occurs when at least 20 percent (one-fifth) of households face extreme food shortages; more than 30 percent of children suffer from acute malnutrition; and at least two out of every 10,000 people or four out of every 10,000 children die each day from starvation or hunger-related causes.The term famine refers to more than simply hunger. It refers to one of the worst humanitarian emergencies possible, indicating a complete collapse of access to food, water and the systems necessary to support life.The World Health Organization (WHO) reported last week that at least 57 children have died from the effects of malnutrition since Israel\u2019s complete blockade began on March 2.Emergency coordinator in Gaza for Doctors Without Borders \u2013 known by its French initials, MSF \u2013 Pascale Coissard, described the aid allowed into Gaza as \u201cridiculously inadequate\u201d. The organisation said that Israel was only permitting food and medicine into Gaza as \u201ca smokescreen to pretend the siege is over\u201d.\u201cThe Israeli authorities\u2019 decision to allow a ridiculously inadequate amount of aid into Gaza after months of an air-tight siege signals their intention to avoid the accusation of starving people in Gaza, while, in fact, keeping them barely surviving,\u201d Coissard said.Israel faces intense international pressure to lift its siege on Gaza. Twenty-three nations, including many of Israel\u2019s traditional allies, have condemned Israel\u2019s action in Gaza, with the United Kingdom, France and Canada threatening sanctions if aid is not allowed to reach those trapped within the enclave.Even the United States, typically Israel\u2019s closest ally, has conceded that aid is not entering Gaza in \u201csufficient amounts\u201d to avert the threat of famine.Not particularly.Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in indiscriminate Israeli attacks over the last week, taking the overall death toll to more than 53,500.Of those, more than 3,500 have been killed since the Israeli government decided to unilaterally break a ceasefire on March 18 and resume its offensive on the Gaza Strip.On Sunday, the Israeli military confirmed that it had expanded ground operations in the northern and southern stretches of the Gaza Strip as part of what it said was an intensified campaign to gain the concessions from Hamas that had eluded it through nineteen months of intense warfare, the destruction of nearly all of Gaza\u2019s buildings and the killing of tens of thousands of civilians, the majority women and children.Despite the humanitarian cost, the decision to allow what critics say is a performative and insufficient amount of food and medicine into Gaza has proven controversial within Israel.Israel\u2019s ultranationalist National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir condemned the decision to allow the small amount of aid into Gaza, calling it \u201ca serious and grave mistake\u201d.However, Ben-Gvir\u2019s fellow traveller on the hard right, Finance Minister Beezalel Smotrich, defended the decision, saying in a televised statement that Israel would permit the \u201cminimum necessary\u201d so \u201cthat the world does not stop us and accuse us of war crimes\u201d."}

Among those killed were at least eight people in Gaza City, two people in central Gaza\u2019s Nuseirat camp and two people in the Maghazi camp in central Gaza, according to Al Jazeera reporters in Gaza.The attacks come after Israel began allowing dozens of humanitarian trucks into Gaza on Tuesday, but the aid has not yet reached Palestinians in desperate need.Jens Laerke, the spokesperson for the UN\u2019s humanitarian agency, said no trucks were picked up from the Gaza side of Karem Abu Salem crossing, known as Kerem Shalom to Israelis, in southern Gaza.Israel announced that 93 aid trucks had entered Gaza from Israel following an 11-week blockade.Reporting from Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum explained that most of those trucks had only received military clearance to enter the Palestinian side of the crossing.\u201cThey are still stuck at the border crossing. Only five trucks have made it in,\u201d Abu Azzoum said, adding, \u201cThis could be another sign of the systematic obstruction of aid in Gaza.\u201dAid groups have said that the amount of aid that Israel is allowing is not nearly enough, calling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s efforts a \u201csmokescreen to pretend the siege is over\u201d.\u201cThe Israeli authorities\u2019 decision to allow a ridiculously inadequate amount of aid into Gaza after months of an air-tight siege signals their intention to avoid the accusation of starving people in Gaza, while, in fact, keeping them barely surviving,\u201d said Pascale Coissard, the emergency coordinator in Khan Younis for Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF.The Israeli military body that oversees humanitarian aid to Gaza said trucks were entering Gaza on Wednesday morning, but it was unclear if that aid would be able to continue deeper into Gaza for distribution.A few dozen Israeli activists opposed to Israel\u2019s decision to allow aid into Gaza while Hamas still holds Israeli captives attempted to block the trucks carrying the aid on Wednesday morning, but were kept back by Israeli police.Israel is facing growing international pressure over its renewed offensive on Gaza.The United Kingdom has suspended talks with Israel on a free trade deal, and the European Union said it will review a pact on political and economic ties over the \u201ccatastrophic situation\u201d in Gaza. Britain, France and Canada have threatened \u201cconcrete actions\u201d if Israel continues its offensive.Pope Leo on Wednesday also appealed for Israel to allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.\u201cI renew my fervent appeal to allow for the entry of fair humanitarian help and to bring to an end the hostilities, the devastating price of which is paid by children, the elderly and the sick,\u201d the pope said during his weekly general audience in Saint Peter\u2019s Square.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday urged world leaders to take immediate action to end Israel\u2019s siege on Gaza, issuing the appeal in a written statement during a visit to Beirut, where he is expected to discuss the disarmament of Palestinian factions in Lebanon\u2019s refugee camps.\u201cI call on world leaders to take urgent and decisive measures to break the siege on our people in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Abbas said, demanding the immediate entry of aid, an end to the Israeli offensive, the release of detainees and a full withdrawal from Gaza.\u201cIt is time to end the war of extermination against the Palestinian people. I reiterate that we will not leave, and we will remain here on the land of our homeland, Palestine,\u201d Abbas said.Since the war began in October 2023 following the Hamas attack that killed 1,139 people in southern Israel, Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed 53,573 people and wounded 121,688 others."}

United Nations officials and humanitarian groups say it will not have the ability to deal with the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza as a result of Israel\u2019s two-month-long blockade.Instead, the aid groups that have been working in Gaza point out that they have the capacity to bring in food and other humanitarian supplies \u2013 if only Israel would let them.So what is the GHF, and why is the situation in Gaza so desperate? Here\u2019s everything you need to know:Officially independent, the GHF is an Israeli- and US-backed body that plans to distribute aid in the Gaza Strip.One in five people in Gaza currently face starvation due to the Israeli blockade of food and aid while 93 percent are experiencing acute food shortages, according to a UN-backed assessment released last week.Under increasing international pressure to allow in aid, Israel has sought to find a solution that it says prevents aid from falling into the hands of the Palestinian group Hamas. Humanitarian organisations say the vast majority of food and other supplies reaches Gaza\u2019s civilian population and is not diverted to fighters.The GHF will be overseen by Jake Wood, a US military veteran who ran Team Rubicon, an organisation that distributed humanitarian aid during natural disasters.Through the GHF, Palestinians in Gaza would receive a \u201cbasic amount of food\u201d.The initial plan was announced last Wednesday with a timeline of about two weeks before it was up and running.It\u2019s still unclear how the GHF will be funded, but the foundation says it will set up \u201csecure distribution sites\u201d to feed 1.2 million people in Gaza before expanding to feed every Palestinian in the territory.It says it will coordinate with the Israeli military while security would be provided by private military contractors.The GHF initiative has been widely panned by aid groups and the UN.The UN and humanitarian aid agencies say they already have the means to distribute desperately needed aid and alleviate the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. The GHF, on the other hand, is seen by critics as a way of politicising aid and not having the experience or capacity to bring aid to more than two million people.The GHF \u201crestricts aid to only one part of Gaza while leaving other dire needs unmet\u201d, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said at the Security Council last week. \u201cIt makes aid conditional on political and military aims. It makes starvation a bargaining chip. It is cynical sideshow. A deliberate distraction. A fig leaf for further violence and displacement.\u201dThe UN and aid groups say the GHF plan violates basic humanitarian principles.\u201cWe are concerned by the proposed aid mechanism for Gaza and are deeply worried that it will not allow for humanitarian aid to be distributed in a manner consistent with core humanitarian principles of impartiality, humanity, and independence,\u201d a statement from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. \u201cThe ICRC cannot work under any mechanism that doesn\u2019t allow us to uphold the principles and our modalities of work.\u201dEleven humanitarian and human rights organisations signed a statement in which they \u201cunequivocally reject the establishment\u201d of the GHF, calling it:\u201cA project led by politically connected Western security and military figures, coordinated in tandem with the Israeli government, and launched while the people of Gaza remain under total siege. It lacks any Palestinian involvement in its design or implementation.\u201dThat lack of Palestinian involvement, coupled with Israel\u2019s approval for the project and the planned presence of the Israeli military \u201con the perimeter\u201d of the distribution sites, according to US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, raises Palestinian suspicions that the establishment of the GHF will give even more power to Israel over aid distribution in Gaza.Israel is blocking it.Israel began preventing the entry of all food and other humanitarian supplies into Gaza on March 2 during a ceasefire, which it unilaterally broke on March 18.Even before the blockade, Israel restricted the amount of aid that could come in, and some Israeli protesters also blocked and destroyed aid.The situation has reached dire levels with the World Food Programme saying 70,000 children need urgent treatment for \u201cacute malnutrition\u201d.The UN said the GHF would weaponise aid by threatening the mass displacement of Palestinians.Initial aid distribution sites would operate only out of southern and central Gaza, which the UN warned could lead to the displacement of Palestinians in northern Gaza as they are forced to move south for food and other aid.\u201cHumanitarian aid should not be politicized nor militarized,\u201d the ICRC statement said. \u201cThis erodes the neutrality required to ensure assistance is delivered based solely on need, not political or military agendas.\u201dThe initiative has also been labelled by many in the humanitarian sector as insufficient.\u201cEven if implemented, the plan\u2019s proposed aid volumes fall short of the immense scale of needs in Gaza,\u201d according to the ICRC. \u201cThe level of need right now is overwhelming, and aid needs to be allowed to enter immediately and without impediment.\u201dGaza currently has 400 distribution points, and the ability and know-how to distribute aid effectively exists. With only a few distribution points under the GHF, people may be forced to walk long distances and carry heavy rations.\u201cThe Problem is Not Logistics,\u201d the statement from the 11 humanitarian groups read. \u201cIt Is Intentional Starvation.\u201dEnough. We demand rapid, safe, and unimpeded access to starving civilians in Gaza.We have a plan. We have thousands of trucks of food at the border. Let us in. Let us work.https://t.co/J55f8shIEU pic.twitter.com/bTmcAMbG0e\u2014 Tom Fletcher (@UNReliefChief) May 16, 2025People with disabilities or who are injured would struggle to navigate the terrain and reach distribution points. The roads in Gaza have been badly damaged over the past 19 months of war, and the intensity of Israel\u2019s latest military operation in Gaza is only making things more difficult for Palestinians there.Furthermore, the GHF\u2019s assertions that it is independent and transparent have been criticised by aid groups.\u201cDespite branding itself as \u2018independent\u2019 and \u2018transparent,\u2019 the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation would be wholly dependent on Israeli coordination and operates via Israeli-controlled entry points, primarily the Port of Ashdod and the Kerem Shalom/Karem Abu Salem crossing,\u201d the statement by the 11 aid groups read.While Hanan Salah, Human Rights Watch\u2019s associate director for the Middle East and North Africa, didn\u2019t comment specifically on the GHF, she said allowing \u201ca basic amount of food\u201d into the Gaza Strip was \u201ccomplicity in using starvation as a method of warfare\u201d."}

We\u2019re supportive,\u201d Rubio continued. \u201cWe understand why for their security Hamas cannot exist. We are also very happy to see that they have allowed aid to begin to flow, and we hope that that will continue.\u201dSeveral Western countries, including close partners of Israel, have recently decried the Israeli siege on Gaza. On Monday, the leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Canada said in a joint statement that they were \u201chorrified\u201d by Israel\u2019s military escalations in Gaza and its blockade on humanitarian aid.They threatened to pursue \u201cconcrete actions\u201d like sanctions if Israel continued to expand its military assault.The administration of US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has remained staunchly pro-Israel, but experts say recent moves from the White House signal a growing gap between the US and Israel.For example, Trump did not include Israel as a stop in his recent trip to the Middle East. He has also initiated diplomatic talks with Iran and declared a ceasefire with Yemen\u2019s Houthi group \u2014 both of which are adversaries of Israel in the region.The Houthis, for instance, continue to launch missiles and drones at Israel in a show of support for the Palestinians in Gaza.Still, over the past three months, the US has refused to directly criticise Israel\u2019s decision to prevent food and medicine from reaching Gaza.But last week, at a stop in the United Arab Emirates, Trump indicated he wanted to get the situation in Gaza \u201ctaken care of\u201d.\u201cA lot of people are starving. There\u2019s a lot of bad things going on,\u201d he said.Also last week, in an interview with the BBC, Rubio said he was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher also told the BBC on Tuesday that as many as 14,000 children in Gaza are at risk of dying in the next 48 hours if food does not reach them.Last year, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant over possible war crimes in Gaza, including the use of starvation as a method of war.On Sunday, Netanyahu said Israel would only allow a \u201cbasic quantity of food\u201d into the Palestinian territory to stave off international pressure.\u201cOur best friends in the world \u2013 senators I know as strong supporters of Israel \u2013 have warned that they cannot support us if images of mass starvation emerge,\u201d he said, according to the publication Haaretz.The Gaza Government Media Office said on Tuesday that at least 58 Palestinians have died of malnutrition over the past 80 days.At Tuesday\u2019s Senate hearing, Rubio appeared to acknowledge that more aid needs to reach the Palestinians in Gaza.\u201cI understand your point that it\u2019s not in sufficient amounts,\u201d Rubio told Merkley. \u201cBut we were pleased to see that decision was made.\u201d"}

Settler violence has surged in the occupied West Bank as the world\u2019s focus has remained on Gaza. Nearly 1,000 Palestinians have been killed and thousands displaced in Israeli raids.The statement comes weeks after the Netherlands urged the European Union (EU) to review a trade agreement with Israel as the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has intensified its bombardment of Gaza amid an aid blockade in place since March 2.Western countries backed Israel\u2019s right to self-defence when Netanyahu\u2019s government launched a devastating offensive in Gaza on October 7, 2023. That offensive has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians and turned vast swathes of Gaza into rubble.On Tuesday, the EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that Israel has the right to defend itself, but its current actions go beyond proportionate self-defence.So what steps might Western countries take against Israel, and has Israel\u2019s latest Gaza onslaught forced them to change their position? Here is what you need to know:The countries\u2019 three leaders criticised Israel\u2019s renewed Gaza offensive, while describing the \u201chuman suffering\u201d of Palestinians in the coastal enclave as \u201cintolerable\u201d.They also said that Israel\u2019s announcement of letting some aid in was \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d.\u201cIf Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response,\u201d the leaders\u2019 statement said.\u201cThe Israeli Government\u2019s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable and risks breaching International Humanitarian Law.\u201cWe condemn the abhorrent language used recently by members of the Israeli Government, threatening that, in their despair at the destruction of Gaza, civilians will start to relocate. Permanent forced displacement is a breach of international humanitarian law.\u201dThe three Western leaders said that while they supported Israel\u2019s right to defend itself following Hamas\u2019s attack on October 7, \u201cthis escalation is wholly disproportionate\u201d.\u201cWe will not stand by while the Netanyahu Government pursues these egregious actions,\u201d they said.On Tuesday, the UK announced it would suspend trade talks with Israel over the Gaza war. It also imposed sanctions on settlers and organisations backing violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.Israel\u2019s conduct in its war on Gaza and the government\u2019s support for illegal settlements is \u201cdamaging our relationship with your government\u201d, said British Foreign Secretary David Lammy.My joint statement with @EmmanuelMacron and @MarkJCarney on the situation in Gaza and the West Bank. pic.twitter.com/76vYpB42xf\u2014 Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) May 20, 2025Amid intense international pressure, Israeli authorities on Monday cleared nine aid trucks to enter Gaza, where harsh restrictions on food and aid have sparked accusations that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war.However, the United Nations\u2019 relief chief Tom Fletcher called the entry of the trucks a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d, adding that \u201csignificantly more aid must be allowed into Gaza\u201d.Fletcher on Tuesday warned that 14,000 Palestinian babies were at risk of dying in the next 48 hours if aid doesn\u2019t reach them \u2013 a figure he called \u201cutterly chilling\u201d. Some half a million people in Gaza, or one in five Palestinians, are facing starvation due to the Israeli blockade.Starving Palestinians have resorted to eating animal feed and flour mixed with sand, highlighting acute suffering among the 2.3 million people in Gaza.The UN humanitarian office\u2019s spokesman Jens Laerke said on Tuesday that about 100 more trucks have been approved by Israel to enter Gaza.Shifting their focus to the occupied West Bank, the leaders of the UK, France and Canada said they opposed all attempts to expand Israeli settlements, as they are \u201cillegal and undermine the viability of a Palestinian state and the security of both Israelis and Palestinians\u201d.\u201cWe will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions,\u201d they said.Yara Hawari, co-director of Al-Shabaka, the Palestinian Policy Network, says the statement by the UK, Canada, and France is \u201creflective of states wanting to backtrack and try and cover up their complicity\u201d, highlighting that the situation in Gaza is the \u201cworst that it has ever been\u201d and that \u201cthe genocide is reaching new levels of cruelty and inhumaneness\u201d.\u201cThey can point to the statement and say, you know, well, we did \u2026 stand up against it,\u201d Hawari told Al Jazeera, adding that none have stopped arms sales to Israel.Hawari specifically referenced the UK\u2019s role, saying it was \u201cparticularly complicit in this\u201d. \u201cThere are reports coming out every day on how many weapons have been transferred from the UK to Israel over the course of the last 19 months,\u201d she said.Sweden\u2019s Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said on Tuesday that her country will push for EU sanctions against Israeli ministers because of insufficient steps to protect civilians in Gaza.\u201cSince we do not see a clear improvement for the civilians in Gaza, we need to raise the tone further. We will therefore now also push for EU sanctions against individual Israeli ministers,\u201d Stenergard said in a statement.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot demanded that Israel\u2019s \u201cblind violence\u201d and blockade of humanitarian assistance must come to an end.On Monday, 24 countries, overwhelmingly European ones, issued a joint statement saying Israel\u2019s decision to allow a \u201climited restart\u201d of aid operations in Gaza must be followed by a complete resumption of unfettered humanitarian assistance.It was signed by the foreign ministers of countries including Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands and the UK.Meanwhile, the European Union\u2019s top diplomat, Kallas, has decided to order a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, a free trade deal between the two regions. Kallas told Al Jazeera that the Netherlands earlier this month had sought review of the Association Agreement, particularly Article 2 \u2013 which states that both parties must respect human rights.The move has been backed by other member states, including Belgium, France, Portugal and Sweden.Robert Patman, a professor of international relations at the University of Otago in New Zealand, says the recent criticism emanating from Western capitals was in part due to public pressure.\u201cI think there\u2019s a sense that in liberal democracies, they can\u2019t ultimately be indifferent to public concern about the situation \u2026 I think another factor is a perception among many countries that [US President Donald] Trump himself is getting impatient with the Netanyahu government,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.Patman explained that with many countries in the Global South having experienced colonialism before, they were quicker than the West to condemn Israel\u2019s actions.\u201cThey have a history of having to struggle for their own political self-determination, and given that experience, they can empathise with the Palestinians who\u2019ve been denied the right,\u201d he said.Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on Monday criticised Carney, Macron and Starmer following their joint statement.\u201cBy asking Israel to end a defensive war for our survival before Hamas terrorists on our border are destroyed and by demanding a Palestinian state, the leaders in London, Ottawa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on 7 October while inviting more such atrocities,\u201d he posted on X.By asking Israel to end a defensive war for our survival before Hamas terrorists on our border are destroyed and by demanding a Palestinian state, the leaders in London, Ottowa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more\u2026\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05df \u05e0\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5 (@netanyahu) May 19, 2025Meanwhile, Israel\u2019s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich lashed out at the three leaders, saying his country \u201cwill not bow its head before this moral hypocrisy, antisemitism, and one-sidedness\u201d.In a post on X, Smotrich accused the three countries of \u201cmorally aligning themselves with a terrorist organisation\u201d.In particular, Smotrich took issue with the three countries saying they are \u201ccommitted to recognising a Palestinian state\u201d.\u201cThey have gone so far as to seek to reward terrorism by granting it a state,\u201d he said.Netanyahu\u2019s government and his far-right coalition partners have been vocal against the realisation of a sovereign Palestinian state despite broad international support for the so-called two-state solution.This major ground offensive, launched by Israel on the Gaza Strip on Sunday, came after days of intense bombardment that killed hundreds of Palestinians.Since Sunday, more than 200 people have been killed in a relentless wave of strikes.Major hospitals, including the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, have been rendered nonoperational after attacks by Israeli forces. Medical professionals said it could lead to the deaths of thousands of sick and wounded people.With the backing of Israel\u2019s lethal air force, the operation is targeting both southern and northern Gaza.The Israeli military said the offensive was launched to expand \u201coperational control\u201d in the Gaza Strip. Israel says its campaign also aims to free the remaining captives held in Gaza and defeat Hamas.However, Netanyahu has been repeatedly criticised by segments of Israeli society, including captives\u2019 families, for failing to prioritise their return. He has also rejected Hamas\u2019s offers to end the war and free the captives.Andreas Krieg, senior lecturer at the School of Security Studies at King\u2019s College London, said that the threats from the UK, France and Canada against Israel set a precedent for other Western governments to emulate.\u201cWhile it will not have a direct impact on Israel\u2019s behaviour on the ground, it widens the boundaries of discourse internationally and makes it easier for other governments to openly stand against Israeli atrocities,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\u201cKey to a change of behaviour in Israel, however, remains the United States,\u201d he said.

As of Monday, a trickle of aid was authorised to enter for the first time since then but was not immediately distributed.Addressing the European Humanitarian Forum in Brussels on Tuesday, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), said relief organisations have run out of words to describe the horrors unfolding in Gaza at Israel\u2019s hands.\u201cBut the worst in all this is that we are confronted with a situation: If there is political will, the war can stop. The siege being imposed on Gaza can be lifted,\u201d Lazzarini said.Since early March, at least 57 children are reported to have died from malnutrition.A UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) assessment says more than 93 percent of children in Gaza, or about 930,000, are at risk of famineUNRWA Director of Health Akihiro Seita added on Tuesday that the situation is getting \u201cexponentially\u201d worse and may soon arrive at a point that is \u201cbeyond our control\u201d.Israel told the UN on Tuesday that it would allow the entry of 100 trucks carrying humanitarian aid, a day after it said it allowed only nine aid trucks into the enclave for the first time in more than 80 days.But UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said no humanitarian aid has been distributed yet, despite more supplies being dropped off on the Palestinian side of the Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) crossing.The Israeli moves have been roundly slammed for fulfilling only a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d of the humanitarian needs in Gaza, which has been largely reduced to rubble by Israeli air strikes and ground operations, which were expanded at the weekend.Israeli attacks continue to kill dozens of Palestinians, including many children, each day while what\u2019s left of infrastructure and aid supplies are being destroyed.The municipality of Deir el-Balah in central Gaza announced on Tuesday that a major well, the last remaining source of drinking water in the area, was destroyed along with its generator in an Israeli strike.This comes as more than 100,000 Palestinians have been driven out of their homes and shelters in the past several days alone, according to the UN, and have nowhere safe to go as they face famine.The Israeli army on Tuesday bombed the Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza\u2019s Khan Younis as well, hitting life-saving medical supplies and causing widespread destruction across the hospital\u2019s different facilities, including oxygen lines and a laboratory.\u201cIn northern Gaza, the Indonesian Hospital is under siege by the Israeli military with patients unable to enter or get out,\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s Hind Khoudary said, reporting from Deir el-Balah.\u201cAside from the Nasser and Indonesian hospitals, two other major hospitals in Gaza, the European and al-Awda, have been bombed and largely put out of service in the past few days,\u201d she added.Tess Ingram, a UNICEF communications manager, explained to Al Jazeera why a scheme hatched by the United States and Israel to take control of aid distribution in Gaza was unacceptable for the international community.She said the UN and its international partners had 400 distribution points all over Gaza to help Palestinians whereas now only a \u201chandful\u201d of militarised points in southern Gaza will be used under the US-Israel plan.\u201cThis would mean that people would have to walk a long way to collect a packet that weighs up to 25kg [55lb] and then walk back again,\u201d she said.Speaking on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasised that only a \u201cminimal\u201d amount of aid will be allowed into Gaza for diplomatic and political reasons as international pressure and condemnation is directed at him and his government.His far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said allowing any aid into Gaza while some Israeli captives taken during the Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023, are still held inside the enclave is \u201ca grave mistake hindering our victory\u201d.As the Israeli military and government continue to promise to \u201cdefeat\u201d Hamas, devastating military strikes on the Palestinian territory have intensified.The Israeli army said on Tuesday afternoon that it attacked 100 targets in Gaza in the preceding 24 hours, claiming they were all \u201cterrorist\u201d targets.At least 53,573 Palestinians have been killed and 121,688 wounded since the start of the war, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health."}

It is the predictable result of a campaign of collective punishment waged with impunity \u2026 The UK\u2019s failure to act is not just a moral disgrace \u2013 it is a political choice.\u201dFormer Labour Party leader and independent MP Jeremy Corbyn also told Al Jazeera the \u201conly one way the government can cease its complicity in genocide\u201d is by \u201cending military cooperation with Israel and imposing sanctions\u201d.Although the Labour government suspended some arms export licences to Israel, it made an exception for the F-35 fighter jet programme, citing its obligations to international supply chains.Meanwhile, a report from the Palestinian Youth Movement, Progressive International and Workers for a Free Palestine revealed earlier this month that the UK sent \u201c8,630 separate munitions\u201d since the partial arms suspension took effect in September.According to the UK government\u2019s own data released on Thursday, it approved 127.6 million pounds ($171m) worth of military equipment to Israel in single-issue licences between October and December 2024 \u2013 despite the partial arms embargo coming into place in September.Last week, a High Court case was launched challenging the UK\u2019s handling of arms export controls to Israel.Gearoid O Cuinn, founding director of the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), which has taken the UK government to court over the sale of weapons, told Al Jazeera that the government\u2019s decision to suspend a future trade deal has \u201cno bearing on the immediate catastrophe in Gaza\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s not a future trade deal that is facilitating the killing and starving kids,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ongoing supply of British weaponry and military support.\u201dAs international pressure intensifies on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government, the European Commission has launched a review of its trade agreement with Israel in response to the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d situation in Gaza.The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said a \u201cstrong majority\u201d of EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels supported the review of the bloc\u2019s association agreement with Israel.The move aims to determine whether Israel has breached its human rights obligations under Article 2 of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.France\u2019s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, speaking in parliament, welcomed the decision and said 17 of the EU\u2019s 27 member states had backed the proposal.Kallas also confirmed that EU sanctions targeting violent Israeli settlers had been drawn up but remain blocked by one member state, which she did not name.\u201cThe aid that Israel has allowed in is, of course, welcomed,\u201d Kallas said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a drop in the ocean.

The past week has seen an intensification of violence across the besieged Palestinian territory, which has killed hundreds of people.The reason for the disappearance of the NGO provision remains unclear, and experts warned it may yet reappear in the bill before the final vote in the House, expected later in the week.The office of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera\u2019s request for comment.With a razor-thin majority in the House, Republicans need every vote to pass the tax bill, which Trump has put at the top of his agenda in Congress.Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the section may have been removed to avoid additional controversy for the must-pass bill, especially because the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan office that oversees procedures, may have rejected it for violating the rules.\u201cIt\u2019s possible that this is a hiccup that they didn\u2019t want, given that it wasn\u2019t even likely to go through,\u201d Hamadanchy told Al Jazeera.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that is the reason for sure. What I can tell you is that we continue to be very vigilant in case it comes back, either later this week or in the future.\u201dFor weeks, Trump has been calling on Congress to pass the bill, which extends his 2017 tax cuts, a key component of his economic plans.But the proposal has faced some opposition from conservative budget hawks, who have argued it does not cut spending enough and would add to the nation\u2019s $36.2 trillion debt. So Republicans can ill-afford unnecessary issues that could derail the passage of the legislation.Rights groups have been rallying against the \u201cnonprofit killer\u201d, saying it violates free speech and the right to due process.The proposal would have granted the secretary of state power to unilaterally declare an NGO \u201cterrorist supporting\u201d and make it ineligible for tax exemptions.It also said the government would not have to reveal the reason behind the designation if \u201cdisclosure of such description would be inconsistent with national security or law enforcement interests\u201d.Under the current rules, organisations certified to be nonprofits by the government get breaks on their federal income taxes. The status also makes donations to such groups tax deductible for donors.While the withdrawn measure would have allowed a targeted NGO to challenge the secretary of state\u2019s decision in court, losing the tax exempt status, even if temporarily, could have proven costly for nonprofits, especially smaller organisations.Hamadanchy said being accused of supporting terrorism could also have prompted banks to close down the accounts of the groups.\u201cAnd then you have legal costs fighting off the designation because even if you might win in court, it\u2019s going to take time to get there, and it\u2019s going to cause a lot of damage to your organisation through that process,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd that\u2019s sort of the point because they want to chill speech.\u201dHamadanchy noted that existing laws already make material support for a designated \u201cterrorist\u201d group a criminal offence with severe penalties.The legislative push coincided with the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on Palestinian rights supporters, especially on college campuses.Secretary of State Marco Rubio has revoked the student visas of several Palestine advocates \u2013 who have not been charged with a criminal offence \u2013 over allegations of \u201csupport for terrorism\u201d.Some advocacy groups have portrayed the \u201cnonprofit killer\u201d as part of a broader push to muzzle voices critical of Israel.\u201cThis bill is designed to silence dissent, especially from Muslim, Palestinian and civil rights organizations that speak out against injustice and genocide,\u201d the Council on American Islamic Relations said in a statement last week.\u201cIt threatens every nonprofit that engages in advocacy, educates the public, or challenges government policy.\u201dThe apparent setback for the nonprofit provision came nearly two weeks after House leaders cancelled a vote on a bill to restrict boycotts of Israel after a backlash from right-wing legislators who voiced opposition to the measure on free speech grounds.Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, said it would be \u201cinteresting\u201d to see how Republican leaders would deal with staunchly pro-Israel measures like the \u201cnonprofit killer\u201d going forward.\u201cThey on the one hand likely see this as a fun opportunity to embarrass Democrats \u2013 whose opposition will be framed as anti-Israel or enabling terror and antisemitism \u2013 and on the other hand they have to worry about principled opposition from within their own ranks,\u201d Friedman told Al Jazeera in a statement."}

Human rights groups and United Nations-backed experts have accused Israel of systematically destroying Gaza\u2019s healthcare system.Earlier, Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of al-Shifa Hospital in the besieged enclave\u2019s north, told Al Jazeera on Sunday that the latest strikes \u2013 which have been ongoing since Saturday \u2013 indicate that Israeli attacks on Gaza\u2019s hospitals are intensifying.\u201cThe medical teams are really suffering, and we have a few numbers of medical teams and staff \u2026 and a lot of people are in need [of] more medical care,\u201d Abu Salmiya said by phone from the hospital on Sunday.Thousands of sick and wounded people could die, he warned. Blood donations are urgently needed.This has been underscored by Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which confirmed that Israeli forces besieged the facility in Beit Lahiya, adding that \u201ca state of panic and confusion is prevailing\u201d.The ministry later said that Israel had cut off the arrival of patients and staff, \u201ceffectively forcing the hospital out of service\u201d.With \u201cthe shutdown of the Indonesian Hospital, all public hospitals in the North Gaza Governorate are now out of service\u201d, it said.Gaza\u2019s healthcare facilities have been targeted repeatedly throughout Israel\u2019s deadly assault that began 18 months ago.Other facilities in the north that have been bombed, burned, and besieged by the Israeli military since the start of the war include Kamal Adwan Hospital, al-Shifa Hospital, al-Ahli Hospital, and al-Awda Hospital. Dozens of other medical clinics, stations, and vehicles have also come under attack.The targeting of health facilities, medical personnel and patients is considered a war crime under the 1949 Geneva Convention.Israel has also battered several hospitals in Gaza\u2019s central and southern areas, including Deir el-Balah\u2019s Al-Aqsa Hospital and the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.Earlier this week, Israel struck two hospitals in Khan Younis. Nine missiles slammed into and around the courtyard of the European Gaza Hospital, killing at least 16 people, while an attack on the Nasser Medical Complex killed two people, including a wounded journalist.Incessant attacks on Gaza\u2019s healthcare sector have left it reeling, devastating its ability to function, while doctors say they are out of medicine to treat routine conditions.Hospitals have also been on the verge of total collapse amid a brutal and ongoing blockade, where Israel continues to bar the entry of much-needed medical supplies, fuel, and other humanitarian aid including food and clean water.The crisis in Gaza has reached one of its darkest periods, humanitarian officials warn, as famine also looms.Israeli air strikes have killed hundreds of Palestinians in the last 72 hours.Strikes over the weekend have also put the European Hospital, the only remaining facility providing cancer treatments in Gaza, out of service.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said dozens of Palestinians have been wounded, and doctors say \u201cthey\u2019re facing numerous challenges in treating injuries because of a lack of medical supplies\u201d.\u201cIsraeli air strikes in Gaza are still escalating as drones and fighter jets hover in the sky,\u201d Khoudary said.The death toll has reached the same level of intensity as the earliest days of the war, said Emily Tripp, executive director of Airwars, an independent group in London that tracks recent conflicts.She says preliminary data indicate the number of incidents where at least one person was killed or injured by Israeli fire hovered around 700 in April. It\u2019s a figure comparable only to October or December 2023 \u2013 one of the heaviest periods of bombardment.In the last 10 days of March, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) estimates, an average of 100 children were killed or maimed by Israeli air strikes every day.Almost 3,000 of the estimated 53,000 killed by Israel since October 7, 2023, have lost their lives since Israel broke a fragile ceasefire on March 18, Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry said.Among those killed in recent days include a volunteer pharmacist with the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund, who was killed with her family in a strike on Gaza City on May 4.A midwife from Al Awda Health and Community Association was also killed with her family in another strike on May 7.A journalist working for Qatar-based television network Al Araby TV, along with 11 members of his family, was also killed."}

The dead and wounded were taken to a nearby field hospital and the Nasser Medical Complex.At least 135 people were killed on Sunday morning, including 42 in the heavily bombed northern parts of Gaza, medical sources told Al Jazeera Arabic. Five journalists were also among the victims when their homes were bombed.At least 464 Palestinians have been killed in the past week as the Israeli military prepared to significantly intensify its ground invasion of the Palestinian territory despite international criticism. At least 53,339 Palestinians have been killed and 121,034 wounded since the start of the war in October 2023, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health.The Israeli army on Sunday confirmed the start of Operation Gideon\u2019s Chariots, which will involve regular and reserve soldiers of the Southern Command leading the ground invasion of both northern and southern Gaza, backed by the air force.It reported attacking more than 670 places in Gaza over the past week and claimed all were \u201cHamas targets\u201d located both above and beneath the ground. Israel has been accused of disproportionately targeting civilians in Gaza, including displaced families.Among the targets have been three major hospitals, adding to the systematic targeting of healthcare facilities across the enclave that has now put three hospitals out of commission this week alone.The Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza was rendered nonoperational on Sunday after the Israeli army laid siege to it beginning at dawn. Marwan al-Sultan, the director of the facility, which was the last functioning public hospital in the north, described the situation as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and called on international organisations to press for medical teams\u2019 safety.Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, told Al Jazeera that the bombing of the Indonesian Hospital is severely impacting chances of survival for those in need of medical care.Thousands of sick and wounded people could die, he warned, adding that blood donations are urgently needed.Dr Muhammad Zaqout, the director general of hospitals in Gaza, condemned \u201cIsrael\u2019s systematic measures against hospitals\u201d.\u201cIsrael deliberately kills wounded people by preventing them from reaching hospitals and directly targets patients, the wounded and medical staff inside hospitals,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.He said al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza\u2019s Jabalia and European Gaza Hospital in southern Gaza have also been bombed, endangering patients and medical staff.Hamas said in a statement early on Sunday that the attacks on displaced Palestinians in Khan Younis marked a \u201cbrutal crime\u201d that was a flagrant violation of international laws and norms.\u201cBy granting the terrorist occupation government political and military cover, the United States administration bears direct responsibility for this insane escalation in the targeting of innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip, including children, women, and the elderly,\u201d the Palestinian group said, also condemning the \u201congoing persecution and killing\u201d of media workers.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Israel\u2019s expanding operation in Gaza. \u201cI am alarmed by reported plans by Israel to expand ground operations and more,\u201d he said on X on Saturday.On Saturday, both Israel and Hamas confirmed that more mediated talks were under way in Qatar.Israel emphasised that the talks are being held with no conditions, including the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which it has completely blocked since March 2 despite looming famine.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signalled on Sunday that his government may be open to either a partial or a comprehensive agreement but only under strict conditions.\u201cEven at this very moment, the negotiation team in Doha is working to exhaust every possibility for a deal \u2013 whether according to the Witkoff framework or as part of ending the fighting, which would include the release of all the hostages, the exile of Hamas terrorists, and the disarmament of the Gaza Strip,\u201d his office said in a statement, referring to White House envoy Steve Witkoff.His office also slammed former Israeli negotiator Oren Setter, who resigned from the team in October and said in a February interview that Netanyahu had squandered two opportunities last year that would have released captives in exchange for ending the war.Setter, a retired brigadier general, criticised Netanyahu on Sunday, telling the public broadcaster Kan that he is concerned the government will once again \u201cmiss the opportunity\u201d of a comprehensive agreement in favour of a potential partial deal.Far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir on Sunday called on Netanyahu to pull the negotiating team back from Doha and refrain from signing any deal with Hamas. He insisted that Hamas must be completely defeated, fulfilling a war goal set out by Israel from the start."}

He called Israel a \u201cdangerous cancerous tumour\u201d that must be \u201cuprooted\u201d.Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also told a gathering of navy officers on Saturday that Trump is extending a message of peace while threatening destruction at the same time as backing Israel\u2019s \u201cgenocide\u201d in the Gaza Strip.\u201cWhich one of this president\u2019s words should we believe? His message of peace, or his message of massacre of human beings?\u201d the Iranian president said, pointing out that Trump sanctioned the International Criminal Court (ICC) in a move that was internationally criticised.The statements came after Trump used his Middle East tour \u2013 during which he signed huge deals with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 to heap praise on Arab leaders neighbouring Iran and blasting the leadership in Tehran.The US president told Arab leaders they were developing their infrastructure while Iran\u2019s \u201clandmarks are collapsing into rubble\u201d after its theocratic establishment replaced a monarchy in a 1979 revolution.He said Iran\u2019s leaders have \u201cmanaged to turn green farmland into dry deserts\u201d as a result of corruption and mismanagement, and pointed out that Iranians are experiencing power outages several hours a day.The blackouts, a result of a years-long energy crisis that is hurting Iran\u2019s already strained economy, are expected to linger for the rest of this year as well, according to Iranian authorities.The largest associations of the mining, steel and cement industries in Iran on Saturday wrote a joint letter to Pezeshkian, urgently requesting him to review a 90 percent electricity use restriction imposed on the critical sectors.Trump, who hailed Syria\u2019s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa and lifted sanctions on Damascus, also took aim at Iran\u2019s regional policy.He described Tehran\u2019s support for the fallen establishment of President Bashar al-Assad as a cause of \u201cmisery and death\u201d and regional destabilisation.Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the US president\u2019s remarks as \u201cdeceptive\u201d, telling state media on Friday it was the US that hampered Iran through sanctions and military threats while backing Israel and attacking Syria.Parliament chief Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who was addressing an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference in Indonesia, said Trump\u2019s remarks showed he was \u201cliving in a delusion\u201d.Hossein Salami, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), addressed Trump directly on Friday and said even though Iran has beautiful landmarks, \u201cwe take pride in the elevation of character, identity, culture, and Islam\u201d.The sharp rhetoric in response to Trump\u2019s latest controversial comments come days after he teased that he may start calling the \u201cPersian Gulf\u201d the \u201cArabian Gulf\u201d soon.This angered Iranians across the board, prompting criticism of any attempt to rename the key waterway from average citizens online, authorities, local media, and even some pro-Trump Iranians outside the country who have been advocating for US sanctions and regime change.Both Iran and the US say they would prefer an agreement that would serve to quickly de-escalate tensions surrounding Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, despite the latest war of words.But after four rounds of negotiations mediated by Oman, any prospective deal \u2013 which would lift sanctions in exchange for making sure Iran would not have a nuclear bomb \u2013 still appears to face significant hurdles.Trump said Tehran has been handed a proposal to rapidly advance towards a deal, but Iran\u2019s Araghchi on Friday said no written proposal was produced yet amid \u201cconfusing and contradictory\u201d rhetoric from Washington.\u201cMark my words: there is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to enrichment for peaceful purposes: a right afforded to all other NPT signatories, too,\u201d he wrote in a post on X, in reference to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.Kazem Gharibabadi, a senior nuclear negotiator, on Friday rejected reports by Western media outlets that Iran may agree to fully halt its enrichment of uranium for the remainder of the Trump presidency to build trust.\u201cThe right to enrich is our absolute red line! No halt to enrichment is acceptable.\u201dTrump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear accord signed between Iran and world powers three years earlier, imposing the harshest sanctions yet by the US that have only intensified during the latest negotiations.The nuclear deal set a 3.67 percent enrichment rate with first-generation centrifuges for civilian use in Iran, in exchange for lifting United Nations sanctions. Iran is now enriching up to 60 percent and has enough fissile material for multiple bombs, but has made no effort to build one yet."}

Many more could starve to death in the coming days and weeks unless immediate action is taken,\u201d it said.Meanwhile, the Council of Europe, a body that works to safeguard human rights and democracy, also noted that Gaza was suffering from a \u201cdeliberate starvation\u201d and warned that Israel was sowing \u201cthe seeds for the next Hamas\u201d in the territory, referring to the Palestinian armed group.\u201cThe time for a moral reckoning over the treatment of Palestinians has come \u2013 and it is long overdue,\u201d said Dora Bakoyannis, rapporteur for the Middle East at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.The European calls came hours after UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said 160,000 pallets of relief and 9,000 trucks were ready to enter Gaza.\u201cTo those proposing an alternative modality for aid distribution, let\u2019s not waste time. We already have a plan,\u201d he said in a statement.\u201cWe have the people. We have the distribution networks. We have the trust of the communities on the ground. And we have the aid itself \u2013 160,000 pallets of it \u2013 ready to move. Now,\u201d he said.\u201cWe demand rapid, safe, and unimpeded aid delivery for civilians in need. Let us work.\u201dIsrael has halted the entry of food, medication and all other essentials into Gaza since March 2. UN agencies and other humanitarian groups have warned of shrinking food, fuel and medicine supplies to the territory of 2.4 million Palestinians facing acute starvation.Earlier, the US and Israel said they were preparing a plan that would allow the resumption of aid by an NGO, while keeping supplies out of Hamas\u2019s hands.Under the heavily criticised alternative aid plan, the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aims to start work in Gaza by the end of May.It intends to work with private US security and logistics firms to transport aid into Gaza to so-called secure hubs where it will then be distributed by aid groups, a source familiar with the plan told the Reuters news agency. It is unclear how the foundation will be funded.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has also asked Israel to allow humanitarian deliveries by the UN and aid groups to resume now until its infrastructure is fully operational, saying this is essential to \u201calleviate the ongoing humanitarian pressure\u201d.The UN, however, said it would not work with the foundation because the distribution plan is not impartial, neutral or independent. Israel says the blockade, alongside \u201cmilitary pressure\u201d, is intended to force Hamas to free the remaining captives.On Thursday, senior Hamas official Basem Naim reiterated the group\u2019s position that the entry of aid into Gaza is a prerequisite for any truce talks with Israel.\u201cAccess to food, water and medicine is a fundamental human right \u2013 not a subject for negotiation,\u201d he said."}

In recent days, Israel has intensified its offensive, as tens of thousands of Palestinians are forced to starve.At a preparatory meeting of the Arab League summit, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said they will try to endorse decisions that were made at their meeting in Cairo in March to support Gaza\u2019s reconstruction as an alternative to Trump\u2019s widely condemned proposal to take over the enclave.During his visit to Qatar, Trump on Thursday reiterated that he wanted the US to \u201ctake\u201d Gaza and turn it into a \u201cfreedom zone\u201d. Earlier this year, he caused an uproar by declaring that the US would turn Gaza into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East\u201d, prompting Arab leaders to come up with a plan to rebuild the territory, at a summit in Cairo.The Arab plan for Gaza proposes rebuilding the Palestinian enclave without displacing its 2.4 million residents.Besides Gaza, Arab officials also discussed Syria, which only six months ago entered a new chapter in its history after the fall of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad.Earlier this week, Trump in Riyadh met Syria\u2019s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose group spearheaded the offensive that toppled al-Assad last December. Prior to their meeting, he also announced that US sanctions on Syria will be lifted in a huge boost to the government in Damascus.Al-Sharaa, who was imprisoned for years in Iraq on charges of belonging to al-Qaeda following the 2003 US-led invasion, however, missed Baghdad\u2019s summit after several powerful Iraqi politicians voiced opposition to his visit. The Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani represented Damascus instead.Saturday\u2019s summit also came amid Iran\u2019s ongoing nuclear talks with the US. Trump has pursued diplomacy with Iran as he seeks to stave off a threatened military strike by Israel on Iran, a desire shared by many of the region\u2019s leaders.On Thursday, Trump said a deal was \u201cgetting close\u201d, but by Friday, he was warning that \u201csomething bad is going to happen\u201d if the Iranians do not move fast.Iraq has only recently regained a semblance of normalcy after decades of devastating conflict and turmoil, and its leaders view the summit as an opportunity to project an image of stability.Reporting from Baghdad, Al Jazeera\u2019s Mahmoud Abdelwahed said the summit was \u201cvery crucial\u201d for Iraq.\u201cThis is the first time the summit has been held in Iraq since 2012 and Iraq takes it as a credit to regain its rule as a player to bridge the gap between member states of the Arab League,\u201d he said."}

The extent of any damage was not clear, and there no immediate reports of casualties.The Houthis have carried out a campaign of attacks against Israel in self-proclaimed solidarity with Palestinians after Israel launched its assault on Gaza in October 2023.Israel has carried out strikes in response, including one on May 6 that damaged Yemen\u2019s main airport in Sanaa and killed several people.Friday\u2019s attacks were the first since US President Donald Trump agreed to a ceasefire deal with the Houthis earlier this month, with the US halting its attacks on Yemen and the group agreeing to end its attacks on shipping lanes in the Red Sea.Israel was not included in that agreement, and its military said it intercepted several missiles fired from Yemen towards Israeli airspace this week.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday that the attacks are \u201cjust the beginning\u201d, describing the Houthis as \u201cjust a tool\u201d, alleging that Iran was \u201cbehind them\u201d.\u201cWe will not stand idly by and allow the Houthis to harm us. We will strike them with greater force, including at their leadership and all the infrastructure that enables them to attack us,\u201d he said in a statement posted on the government\u2019s social media account.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz pledged to \u201chunt down and eliminate\u201d Houthi leader Abdel-Malik al-Houthi if the rebel group continued \u201cto fire missiles at the State of Israel\u201d.Alluding to recent Houthi attacks on Israel, Katz indicated leader al-Houthi would meet the same fate as Hamas commanders Mohammed Deif and Yahya Sinwar in Gaza, Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon \u2013 all killed in Israeli attacks over the last year.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Jordan\u2019s capital Amman, said that since Israel broke a ceasefire agreement with Hamas back in March \u2013 killing almost 3,000 since then, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry \u2013 the Houthis had launched \u201cat least 34 different projectiles\u201d towards Israel.She said that Israel\u2019s policy \u201cmoving forward\u201d would be to strike back. \u201cFor every missile that\u2019s fired, they\u2019re going to be conducting these types of air strikes,\u201d she said."}

The last week has shown the opposite, an intensification of violence across the besieged Palestinian territory, leaving hundreds dead, and hundreds of thousands terrified of what comes next.This was a week where United States President Donald Trump toured the Middle East, visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. There had been hope that some kind of ceasefire deal would be announced, or that the US would put more pressure on Israel to seriously come to the negotiating table. That was particularly the case after Hamas released a US-Israeli captive on Monday without demanding anything in exchange.Ultimately, none of that happened, with Trump returning to his idea of US involvement in the future administration of whatever is left of Gaza, while acknowledging that Palestinians there were starving.Israel also intercepted a number of missiles fired by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, before attacking Yemen itself on Friday.Lets take a closer look at a week that has devastated Gaza, and left Palestinians there feeling even more abandoned.According to figures compiled by Al Jazeera, at least 370 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since Sunday. The violence has been particularly deadly in the second half of the week, with medical sources reporting the killing of at least 100 Palestinians on Friday, and 143 on Thursday. Many of those killed have been women and children.These are some of the worst single-day death tolls since the beginning of the war in October 2023.The killings put the total death toll reported by the Gaza Ministry of Health more than 53,000, although the territory\u2019s Government Media Office\u2019s death toll now sits at more than 61,700, as it includes thousands of Palestinians still under the rubble who are presumed dead.Israeli attacks have targeted the whole Gaza Strip, with a particular focus on the north. Hospitals have also repeatedly been bombed by Israel.The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has been caused by Israel\u2019s complete blockade of the entry of all food and medication to the Strip since March 2, a decision it made when the ceasefire was still ongoing, and one that goes against international law.A report released on Monday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) initiative said that the Gaza Strip was \u201cstill confronted with a critical risk of famine\u201d, with half a million people facing starvation and 93 percent of its more than 2 million population at severe risk.People are already starving to death \u2013 Gaza authorities last week said that 57 people had died as a result of starvation.Trump acknowledged that \u201ca lot of people are starving\u201d in Gaza and said that the US was \u201cgoing to get that taken care of\u201d, but provided few details. The US has backed a new body called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that it says will start work in Gaza by the end of the month.But the plan has been rejected by the United Nations and other humanitarian groups, who say that the plan would lead to more displacement for Palestinians in Gaza, as it would only disperse aid in some areas of Gaza, and set a dangerous precedent for the delivery of aid in warzones.The UN has reiterated that it has the capacity to deliver aid across Gaza, but is being prevented from doing so by Israel. It says it has enough aid ready to deliver to feed all of the Palestinians in Gaza for four months, if Israel allows its trucks in.Palestinians in Gaza have been recounting the horrors of the past week, desperately calling for the world to act and stop Israel\u2019s bombing.In northern Gaza\u2019s Jabalia refugee camp, one of the worst hit areas, one civilian had a simple message \u2013 \u201ceither kill us or let us live.\u201d\u201cAll of [the strikes] were targeting civilians. All the houses are being bombed \u2013 everything is gone,\u201d Ahmed Mansour told Al Jazeera. \u201cWhat is a person supposed to do? They\u2019re all making a joke out of us. I\u2019m heading to the coast now. We\u2019ve been displaced more than 50 times \u2013 either kill us or let us live.\u201dTaher al-Nunu, a senior Hamas official, also called on Friday for the US to put more pressure on Israel to open the crossings into Gaza and \u201callow the immediate entry of humanitarian aid \u2013 food, medicine and fuel \u2013 to the hospitals in the Gaza Strip\u201d.The Israeli government has made it clear that it is unwilling to agree to a deal that would end the war in return for the release of all the Israeli captives still held in Gaza, despite widespread domestic support for such a deal.Instead, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks of total victory against Hamas, although it is difficult to see what that would entail.Instead, the war drags on, and Netanyahu said on Monday that preparations were continuing for \u201can intensification of the fighting\u201d. Last week, he said that Israel was planning for the \u201ctotal conquest\u201d of Gaza.Trump left the Middle East this week with no ceasefire deal agreed, only saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to find out pretty soon\u201d when asked whether a deal was in place for the return of Israel\u2019s captives.Meanwhile, the Israeli newspaper Ha\u2019aretz reported that Israel\u2019s position was \u201crigid\u201d and that the US had \u201clost interest\u201d. A source told the newspaper that US envoy Steve Witkoff was \u201cno longer involved\u201d.\u201cHe\u2019s waiting to hear what we want, and since we don\u2019t want anything, he has nothing left to do,\u201d the source said."}

The Israeli military has not commented on the strikes.Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated a promise to push ahead with a promised escalation in pursuit of his aim to destroy Hamas, the Palestinian armed group that governs Gaza.That follows an announcement by Netanyahu last week that the military campaign would be intensified should Hamas fail to agree a deal to release the remaining captives by the time United States President Donald Trump finished his tour of the Middle East.Trump was due to wrap up his four-day trip, which did not include a visit to Israel or Palestine, on Friday.There had been hope that the tour could help usher in a ceasefire deal or renewal of aid to Gaza. The humanitarian crisis in the enclave is building with an Israeli blockade of the territory now in its third month.However, Israeli officials suggested last week that plans include the \u201cconquest\u201d and full military occupation of the entire Gaza Strip, and potentially a bid to push Palestinians out of the enclave \u2013 a suggestion also put forward by Trump.Israel\u2019s war on Gaza has killed at least 53,010 Palestinians and wounded 119,919, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health. The Strip\u2019s Government Media Office has updated its death toll to more than 61,700, saying thousands of others missing under the rubble are presumed dead.Israel has halted the entry of food, medication and all other essentials into Gaza since March 2, saying that the blockade, alongside \u201cmilitary pressure\u201d, is intended to force Hamas to free the remaining captives.However, senior Hamas official Basem Naim reiterated on Thursday the group\u2019s position that the entry of aid into Gaza is a prerequisite for any talks with Israel.\u201cAccess to food, water and medicine is a fundamental human right \u2013 not a subject for negotiation,\u201d he added.The US and Israel are preparing a plan that they say will allow the resumption of aid by an NGO, while keeping supplies out of Hamas\u2019s hands.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has said it will begin distributing aid this month. However, the United Nations and other aid organisations have ruled out involvement in the initiative, saying it does not respect the impartiality, neutrality and independence of aid operations.However, the US is pushing on, apparently keen to \u201cget involved\u201d in Gaza, as Trump put it during his trip to the region.Speaking in the United Arab Emirates on Friday, the US president said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at Gaza. And we\u2019re going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving.\u201dThe previous day, however, he reiterated his idea of having the US take over Gaza and pushing Palestinians out of the enclave.\u201cI have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good \u2026 let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,\u201d he said, adding that he would be \u201cproud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone\u201d.The comments echoed a widely condemned idea he floated in February for the US to \u201ctake over\u201d the devastated territory and redevelop it into \u201cthe Riviera of the Middle East\u201d.In response, Hamas official Naim said that the territory is \u201cnot for sale\u201d.\u201cGaza is an integral part of Palestinian land,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt is not real estate for sale on the open market.\u201d"}

A report released by Doctors of the World (Medecins du Monde) this week states that in just 18 months, acute malnutrition in Gaza has risen to levels similar to those found in countries enduring protracted humanitarian crises spanning several decades.Starvation is when the human body is deprived of food for so long that it suffers and often dies.Estimates say the body can last up to three weeks without food, but the length of time varies between individuals.Starvation occurs over three stages. The first begins as early as when a meal is skipped, the second occurs with a prolonged period of fasting where the body uses stored fat for energy.The third, and often fatal, stage is when all stored fats have been depleted and the body turns to bone and muscle as sources of energy.Children are most vulnerable to Israel\u2019s continued blockade of essential food items.More than 9,000 children have been admitted to hospital for treatment for acute malnutrition since the start of the year, according to the United Nations.The IPC projects that between now and March 2026, nearly 71,000 children under the age of five will suffer from acute malnutrition, including 14,100 children facing severe cases of malnutrition.The effect of malnutrition on children varies, but the first 1,000 days of a child\u2019s life, which includes the pregnancy up to two years, are critical for a child\u2019s healthy development.Malnutrition leads to an out-of-proportion height-to-weight ratio, stunted growth and eventually, death.Earlier this month, at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, Dr Ahmed Abu Nasir said the situation has become worse than ever due to the blockade.\u201cChildren are in their growing stage and badly need certain nutrients, including proteins and fats,\u201d the paediatrician told Al Jazeera. \u201cThese are not available in the Gaza Strip, particularly in the north.\u201dPregnant and breastfeeding women will also need to be treated for malnutrition, with 17,000 women facing this risk.The entire population of Gaza, about 2.1 million people that remain, are facing levels of food shortages that threaten their existence.Earlier this month, Ahmad al-Najjar, a displaced Palestinian in Gaza City, told Al Jazeera, \u201cFinding a single meal has become an impossible quest.\u201dDespite large numbers of trucks carrying vital supplies piling up on the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, Palestinians in Gaza have resorted to selling rubbish to afford the eye-wateringly inflated food prices.Some 93 percent of Gaza\u2019s population is at risk of levels of food insecurity above the crisis levels indicated by the IPC. If the situation does not change, the IPC has indicated that of those 2.1 million people:In essence, in as little as a month, Gaza\u2019s entire population could be starving.The features of malnutrition and starvation are unmistakable in Gaza, with severely underweight children and babies. In children, severe protein deficiency causes fluid retention and a swollen abdomen.Food insecurity across the Gaza Strip is severely affecting all areas of the blockaded enclave.All 25 bakeries supported by the World Food Programme (WFP) closed at the beginning of April due to the lack of supplies, and food stocks for most of the 177 hot meal kitchens are reportedly exhausted.Certain governorates are experiencing more severe levels of hunger. According to the IPC:The IPC says Israel\u2019s continued blockade \u201cwould likely result in further mass displacement within and across governorates\u201d, as items essential for people\u2019s survival will be depleted.

But eventually he signed and said he hadn\u2019t committed any war crimes.\u201dIn an account of his interaction with the Israeli tourist posted on X last month, Kishi described the man as an otherwise pleasant guest and admitted to feeling a \u201clittle sorry for him\u201d.\u201cThe pledge thing made us pretty awkward, but he still greeted me every time we met,\u201d Kishi wrote.\u201cHe even held the door open for me while I was carrying my luggage. But he believed that what Israel was doing was absolutely right and thought that I was brainwashed for criticising it.\u201dGiven the number of troops deployed in Gaza, the number of casualties there, and the number of Israeli travelers abroad, it is statistically undeniable that those who have committed war crimes are walking freely in major cities and tourist destinations in the world.\u2014 Guesthouse WIND VILLA (@WindVilla) May 1, 2025The Israeli tourist, who has not been named, shared a similar version of events with an Israeli news outlet following his trip to Kyoto \u2013 although the Israeli report suggested the pledge was a \u201ccondition for check-in\u201d.\u201cIn the end, I decided to sign it because I have nothing to hide,\u201d the guest was quoted as telling Ynet News, which said the tourist had served as a combat medic in the navy reserves.\u201cThe statement is true \u2013 I did not commit any war crimes, and Israeli soldiers do not commit war crimes. I signed because I didn\u2019t want to create problems, and because this form means nothing,\u201d he was quoted as saying.Following complaints from Cohen and the Israeli embassy, Kyoto tourism authorities visited the guest house several times to carry out an investigation, Kishi said.\u201cAt least the authorities, both from the city and the Japanese government, don\u2019t think it\u2019s a violation of the Hotel Act,\u201d Kishi said, referring to the Japanese law governing public accommodations.\u201cThey are just expressing their concerns and trying to convince us to change our measures. But it\u2019s beyond their authority, so it\u2019s very indirect.\u201dKishi said he has tweaked the wording of the pledge to state that it would not affect guests\u2019 eligibility to stay at WIND VILLA, to avoid further incidents.He also clarified in a public letter to Cohen that the pledge requires \u201call guests whom our guesthouse identifies as potentially having been involved in war crimes to sign the form,\u201d including those from Burundi, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Mali, Myanmar, Palestine, Russia, Syria, and Sudan.Booking.com has suspended WIND VILLA\u2019s account since the April incident, although the Israeli guest used rival site Expedia.com to book his stay, according to Kishi.On April 28, our guesthouse was suddenly suspended by https://t.co/ALza8eLJ8e without any prior inquiry, just three days after receiving a letter from the Israeli Ambassador.\nHowever, the Israeli guest in question had used a different booking site, not https://t.co/ALza8eLJ8e. pic.twitter.com/t9Z2OJ3ghF\u2014 Guesthouse WIND VILLA (@WindVilla) May 1, 2025WIND VILLA\u2019s other accounts on booking sites, including Expedia.com, continue to operate as normal, Kishi said.The Kyoto government and Israel\u2019s embassy in Tokyo did not reply to Al Jazeera\u2019s requests for comment.The Japan Times quoted a city official as saying WIND VILLA had not violated Japanese law, but the pledge was \u201cinappropriate\u201d.Booking.com told Al Jazeera that the company\u2019s mission \u201cis to make it easier for everyone to experience the world, and we do not tolerate discrimination of any kind\u201d.\u201cWe have temporarily suspended this property so that we can investigate the matter further,\u201d the spokesperson said.The WIND VILLA incident follows a similar occurrence in Kyoto last year, when a local hotel refused an Israeli man accommodation over his potential ties to Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza.The Kyoto hotel in question received verbal and written warnings from the city that it had acted illegally, according to Japan\u2019s Kyodo News.Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa told local media at the time that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for any hotel to refuse accommodation because of a guest\u2019s nationality.\u201cWe hope all visitors to Japan will be able to engage in various activities in Japan, feeling secure,\u201d she told a news conference."}

In Jabalia in northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on al-Tawbah medical clinic killed at least 15 people and wounded several others, the health ministry said.Israel\u2019s army also attacked three hospitals in north and south Gaza: al-Awda hospital in Jabalia, the Indonesian Hospital in Khan Younis, and the European hospital, which Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry says is now out of service.Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah, described \u201canother bloody day\u201d in Gaza, as Israel intensified its air attacks on residential areas.\u201cIsraeli warplanes directly targeted nine houses without any warning in the city of Khan Younis,\u201d he said, adding that entire families were \u201ccompletely wiped out\u201d.He described the situation as chaotic, with civilians fleeing repeated forced evacuation orders. \u201cThe Israeli military targeted civilians while they were asleep,\u201d launching 13 air raids on the Jabalia refugee camp and nearby areas. Civil defence teams, he added, were overwhelmed and struggling to rescue those trapped under the rubble, due to a lack of equipment.Abu Azzoum said the strikes reflect a \u201cpattern of attacks not aimed at military targets, but at systematically destroying Gaza\u2019s social fabric\u201d.Hamas said in a statement that Israel was making a \u201cdesperate attempt to negotiate under cover of fire\u201d as indirect ceasefire talks take place between Israel and Hamas, involving US envoys and Qatar and Egyptian mediators in Doha.The latest killings come amid new waves of forced displacement. Thousands fled Gaza City on Thursday after the Israeli military issued forced evacuation orders the day before.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hani Mahmoud reported scenes of panic and fear as residents packed their belongings and tried to escape the expected onslaught.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing families carrying their belongings and taking to the streets,\u201d Mahmoud said. \u201cThe children and elderly are carrying whatever they\u2019re able to carry \u2026 They don\u2019t know where to go.

What\u2019s left in Gaza? Innocent children are dying. There is no armed activity here. Most of them are elderly people who are dying,\u201d he said.The attacks come as Palestinians mark the 77th anniversary of the Nakba, or catastrophe, when more than 750,000 Palestinians were forcibly expelled by Zionist paramilitary groups during the creation of Israel in 1948.Regarding the wider mood in Gaza on Nakba Day, Abu Azzoum said people were \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about a potential expansion of Israeli ground operations. \u201cThey believe the Israeli army may force them to flee again \u2013 to new areas where conditions are even worse.\u201dDespite international diplomacy, \u201cthere is no sign of a slowdown on the ground,\u201d he warned.Elsewhere in the region, President Donald Trump concluded a visit to Qatar on Thursday, where Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani urged the leader of the United States to use his influence to help secure a ceasefire in Gaza.\u201c\u200aOur teams are engaged in intensive diplomacy to secure a ceasefire in Gaza to protect all civilians, especially innocent women and children, and ensure the release of all hostages,\u201d Al Thani said during a state dinner on Wednesday.\u201cThis conflict is the key to wider stability in the region. From the West Bank to Yemen to Lebanon, and time is short,\u201d the Qatari leader said.\u201cMr President, your involvement could catalyse a breakthrough where others have stalled.

If we act together, we have a real shot at ending the bloodshed and restoring regional confidence,\u201d he added.Trump on Thursday reiterated his radical vision for the future of Gaza, suggesting Washington should take control of the besieged territory.\u201cI have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good, make it a freedom zone, let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone.\u201dTrump\u2019s comments come as Israel\u2019s war on Gaza continues to escalate, with the enclave suffering unprecedented levels of destruction and civilian casualties.The US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, spoke to Al Jazeera\u2019s diplomatic editor James Bays this week and \u201cpainted a positive picture on a deal on Gaza\u201d, with a potential agreement being reached \u201cpretty soon\u201d.When asked whether Witkoff was referring only to aid access \u2013 given that aid is currently completely blocked for the people of Gaza, with no food or medicine getting in \u2013 or to a ceasefire, he replied, \u201cAll of it, I\u2019m positive about all that.\u201dMeanwhile, the Israeli government appears to be laying the groundwork for a parallel escalation in the occupied West Bank.Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a key figure in Israel\u2019s far-right coalition, has openly called for military forces to destroy Palestinian towns and villages in the West Bank, echoing the destruction witnessed in Gaza.\u201cJust as we are flattening Rafah, Khan Younis and Gaza, we have to flatten the terror hubs,\u201d Smotrich said, referring specifically to the Palestinian village of Bruqin, where an Israeli settler was killed on Wednesday evening.Israeli forces launched new raids across the occupied West Bank at dawn on Thursday, storming cities and refugee camps including Tubas, Nablus, Bethlehem and Dura. Residents in Qalandiya, Ya\u2019bad, Fawwar and Askar camps also reported house raids, arrests and what rights groups describe as systematic abuse.Later, Israel\u2019s military said it killed five Palestinians and arrested a sixth who had barricaded themselves in a building in Tammun, about 35km (22 miles) from Bruqin, following an exchange of fire with soldiers.The military wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group issued a statement saying five of its members were killed while clashing with Israeli forces that surrounded their house in the town of Tammun."}

Humanitarian and United Nations aid groups have said that they already have the means of delivering aid to Gaza but are being blocked from doing so by Israel.Israel has completely cut off Gaza\u2019s access to food, water, fuel, and humanitarian aid since March 2, prompting global monitors of extreme hunger to warn of possible famine and allegations of the use of starvation as a weapon of war by human rights groups.Israel has claimed, with little evidence, that members of the armed Palestinian group Hamas are stealing large portions of aid entering the Strip, and have pushed for the exclusion of UN organisations, long viewed with ire by Israeli authorities, from aid distribution.A newly created body with US backing called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said on Wednesday that it would begin operations in Gaza by the end of May, and that it has asked Israel to allow increased levels of aid into the Strip.Critics have said that the new organisation fulfils an Israeli goal of sidelining the UN and independent international organisations from aid distribution in Gaza.\u201cGHF emphasizes that a successful humanitarian response must eventually include the entire civilian population in Gaza,\u201d the foundation\u2019s executive director, Jake Wood, wrote in a letter to the Israeli government.\u201cGHF respectfully requests that the [Israeli military] identify and deconflict sufficient locations in northern Gaza capable of hosting GHF-operated secure distribution sites that can be made operational within 30 days,\u201d he added.A recent report by the Observer, a UK-based news outlet, notes that a GHF fundraising document appears to mirror claims about the problems of humanitarian assistance in Gaza that do not include the actions of the Israeli government itself and instead blame a \u201ccollapse\u201d of \u201ctraditional humanitarian channels\u201d due to aid diversion and combat operations.Thousands of aid trucks have been bottlenecked outside of Gaza amid Israel\u2019s blockade for weeks, with UN officials stressing that they are ready and capable of resuming aid distribution in the Strip, if Israel will lift the siege."}

The question will likely eventually be decided by the US Supreme Court.The administration has further relied on the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to justify its actions. An obscure provision of the law allows the US secretary of state to deport any non-citizen deemed to have \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign consequences\u201d.In a separate ruling related to Columbia University Student Mahmoud Kahlil in April, a federal judge adopted a broad interpretation of the provision, saying Kahlil was deportable based on Rubio\u2019s claims he took part in \u201canti-Semitic\u201d protests. That came despite the top US diplomat providing no further evidence.Similarly, the Department of Homeland Security had previously claimed in a post on X that Khan Suri was \u201cspreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media\u201d.It added he \u201cwas married to the daughter of a senior advisor for to Hamas terrorist group\u201d.But speaking to reporters, Nermeen Arastu, one of the lawyers representing Khan Suri, noted that evidence backing up those claims has not been presented by government lawyers in court.Arastu, who is also an associate professor of law at the CUNY School of Law, said it was notable that \u201cthe court today also pointed out that the government is kind of throwing around accusations in social media, but not presenting them in the formal courtroom setting\u201d.\u201cAnd tied that to this due process concept that\u2019s so important here to understand \u2013 that at the very basic level, you have a right to understand the allegations that are being brought against you,\u201d she said.Critics have further accused the Trump administration of targeting Khan Suri based on his familial ties. His wife is the daughter of Ahmed Yousef, a former adviser to assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh who left his position with the armed group more than a decade ago.\u201cHe should have never been arrested and jailed for his constitutionally protected speech just because the government disagrees with him,\u201d ACLU of Virginia senior immigrants\u2019 rights lawyer Sophia Gregg, told reporters on Wednesday.\u201cHe should have never been punished for his relationship with his wife or his father-in-law,\u201d she said.Like in the cases of Ozturk and Mahdawi, Khan Suri\u2019s cases will proceed despite his release. He faces two separate legal proceedings, one in immigration court in the one challenging his arrest and detention in Virginia.He remained in detention in Texas when the ruling was issued on Wednesday, his lawyers said, adding they were expecting him to be released shortly.Saleh said at the court that she had recently spoken to her husband from the detention centre in Texas, where he was held.\u201cHe told me if my suffering in the detention centre is because I married a Palestinian and because I spoke out against the genocide in Gaza, then I should wear it as a badge of honour,\u201d she said."}

We can\u2019t get the wounded out. Doctors can\u2019t get in. What he\u2019s doing is a disgrace. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201dMacron, who visited injured Palestinians in El Arish hospital in Egypt last month, called to reopen the Gaza border to humanitarian convoys. \u201cThen, yes, we must fight to demilitarise Hamas, free the hostages and build a political solution,\u201d he said.But Netanyahu on Wednesday condemned the French leader\u2019s comments.\u201cMacron has once again chosen to stand with a murderous Islamist terrorist organisation and echo its despicable propaganda, accusing Israel of blood libels,\u201d a statement from Netanyahu\u2019s office read.Meanwhile, half a million Palestinians are facing possible starvation, living at \u201ccatastrophic\u201d levels of hunger, while one million others can barely get enough food, according to findings by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a leading international authority on the severity of hunger crises.Israel has banned all food, shelter, medicine and any other goods from entering the Palestinian territory for the past 10 weeks, even as it carries out waves of air strikes and ground operations.Gaza\u2019s population of about 2.3 million people relies almost entirely on outside aid to survive, because Israel\u2019s 19-month-old military campaign has wiped out most capacity to produce food inside the territory."}

seat as Trump announces Saudi deals", "date": "13 May 2025", "media_type": "news", "link": null, "content": "Washington, DC \u2013 United States President Donald Trump says that forging formal relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel would be a \u201cdream\u201d, but he wants the kingdom to do it on its \u201cown time\u201d.The White House on Tuesday made public a flurry of economic and defence pacts with Saudi Arabia involving hundreds of billions of dollars, but any mention of Israel was conspicuously absent from the announcements.The so-called \u201cnormalisation\u201d drive between Saudi Arabia and Israel dominated his predecessor, Joe Biden\u2019s, approach to the region, but the current US president is shifting focus elsewhere, analysts say.\u201cThe Trump administration has made it clear they are willing to move forward on key agreements with Saudi Arabia without the previous condition of Saudi-Israel normalisation,\u201d said Anna Jacobs, a non-resident fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute, a think tank.\u201cThis probably reflects growing frustration in the Trump administration with Israeli military action across the region, especially in Gaza.\u201dKristian Coates Ulrichsen, fellow for the Middle East at the Baker Institute, also said that Trump has realised that with the ongoing war in Gaza and Israel\u2019s refusal to negotiate the establishment of a Palestinian state, the \u201ctime is not right\u201d for a Saudi Arabia-Israeli pact despite Biden\u2019s emphasis on brokering a deal.\u201cI think the White House has finally acknowledged that a normalisation agreement at this time is not possible,\u201d Coates Ulrichsen told Al Jazeera.During his first term, Trump managed to broker the Abraham Accords between Israel and several Arab countries, including the United Arab Emirates, which established formal relations with the US ally independently of the Palestinian issue.However, the agreements were unsuccessful in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as evidenced by the outbreak of the war in Gaza in October 2023.But even before the war started, Israel had been intensifying its military raids against Palestinians and expanding illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank, further dimming the prospects of a two-state solution to the conflict.Despite the agreements\u2019 apparent shortcomings, Biden made adding Saudi Arabia to the Abraham Accords a focal point of his Middle East agenda, and US officials said they worked on securing a deal up until the final days of the administration, even as the war on Gaza was raging.Biden has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that Hamas launched its October 7 attack against Israel in 2023 to thwart an agreement between the Saudis and Israelis.Still, a day before he left office, Biden boasted that his Middle East policies created an opportunity for \u201cthe future of normalisation and integration of Israel with all its Arab neighbours, including Saudi Arabia\u201d.US officials and media reports said that Biden\u2019s deal, which never materialised, would have brought a security pact between Riyadh and Washington and provided US help for Saudi Arabia to establish a civil nuclear programme in exchange for normalisation with Israel.A major sticking point in that push has been the widely stated Saudi Arabian support for the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, which conditions recognition of Israel on the establishment of a viable Palestinian state.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has categorically rejected the \u201cland for peace\u201d framework, pushing instead for deals with Arab countries that bypass Palestinians.\u201cThis Israeli government won\u2019t even provide lip service to the idea of a two-state solution, making it pretty impossible for Saudi Arabia to seriously consider moving forward with normalisation,\u201d said Jacobs from the Arab Gulf States Institute.\u201cThe Trump administration seems to have understood that it\u2019s off the table, at least for now.\u201dIn Riyadh, Trump announced an agreement to deepen security cooperation with Saudi Arabia.The $142bn deal will provide Saudi Arabia with \u201cstate-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services\u201d from US firms, the White House said.It also includes \u201cextensive training and support to build the capacity of the Saudi armed forces, including enhancement of Saudi service academies and military medical services\u201d, it added.While the weapons and training deals fall short of a NATO-like mutual defence pact, which may have been included as part of an accord with Israel, they take a bite from the US-backed carrots offered to the kingdom for normalisation, experts say.\u201cThe announcements today do further deepen the links between Saudi and US security and defence interests,\u201d Coates Ulrichsen said.Trump\u2019s visit to the region comes as Israel has promised to not just continue, but expand, its devastating war on Gaza, which has killed more than 52,900 Palestinians, according to health authorities.Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University, noted that Riyadh has described Israeli atrocities in Gaza as a \u201cgenocide\u201d.\u201cThe Saudis are not mincing their words; they are not holding back,\u201d Elgindy told Al Jazeera. \u201cThey can\u2019t now move toward normalisation with Israel after accusing Israel of genocide. That would just be ridiculous.\u201dAfter his trip to Saudi Arabia, Trump will head to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates as part of the first planned foreign trips of his presidency, since attending Pope Francis\u2019s funeral last month. Israel is not on the itinerary.For Coates Ulrichsen and others, Trump\u2019s apparent snub of Israel reflects unease in the US-Israeli alliance.\u201cIt may be a signal that the White House sees much more value in deepening commercial and strategic relationships with the Gulf states at the moment, given that Israel remains mired in conflict,\u201d Coates Ulrichsen told Al Jazeera.Tensions between the Trump administration and Netanyahu\u2019s government have become more apparent in recent weeks despite the US\u2019s military and diplomatic backing of Israel.Trump confirmed talks with Iran over its nuclear programme during Netanyahu\u2019s visit to the White House, despite the Israeli leader\u2019s opposition to negotiations with Tehran.Last week, the US president also declared a ceasefire with the Houthis. The deal did not demand an end to the Yemeni group\u2019s attacks against Israel.As Trump spoke in Riyadh on Tuesday, the Houthis fired another missile at Israel \u2013 part of a campaign they say aims to pressure an end to the war on Gaza.The Trump administration also worked with mediators in Qatar and Egypt to secure the release of US citizen Edan Alexander, who served in the Israeli military and was captured by Hamas during the October 7 attack on Israel. According to Israeli media reports, Israel was excluded from those talks.Elgindy from Georgetown University said the apparent tensions are more than a \u201cbump in the road\u201d, but their impact on the US-Israeli relationship remains to be seen.\u201cTrump is making clear in word and deed that US and Israeli interests are not one and the same,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s very significant because Biden didn\u2019t do that.\u201dFor now, Trump remains committed to US military aid to Israel even as it intensifies its bombardment and starvation campaign in Gaza.And the US president has pushed on with his crackdown on critics of Israel at home, especially on college campuses.Still, experts say that by skipping Israel during his Middle East trip and de-prioritising normalisation, Trump is pushing forward in pursuit of his own vision for the region.On Tuesday, Trump lauded Gulf leaders whom he said are building a Middle East \u201cwhere people of different nations, religions and creeds are building cities together \u2013 not bombing each other out of existence\u201d.That future seems at odds with what Israel appears to be seeking: asserting hegemony over the region with long-term bombing campaigns, including in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.\u201cA very strong signal is being sent that a stable, prosperous Middle East \u2013 represented, in the administration\u2019s views, by the Gulf states \u2013 is a much more desirable outcome than maybe the Israeli view of the Middle East at the moment, which is one of seemingly escalating a forever conflict,\u201d said Coates Ulrichsen."}

Gaza\u2019s Government Media Office put the death toll at 215.Israel\u2019s military said in a post on Telegram that the strike targeted a Hamas \u201ccommand and control complex\u201d at Nasser, the largest hospital in southern Gaza, without providing evidence.\u201cThe compound was used by the terrorists to plan and execute terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians and troops,\u201d the post said, in what appeared to be a reference to Eslaih and Hamas.Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry condemned \u201cthe repeated targeting of hospitals and the pursuit and killing of wounded patients inside treatment rooms\u201d, saying it \u201cconfirms Israel\u2019s deliberate intent to inflict greater damage to the healthcare system\u201d.Hospitals in Gaza have been a frequent target of Israeli attacks since the war began in October 2023 although attacking health facilities, medical personnel and patients is illegal under the 1949 Geneva Conventions.According to officials in Gaza, Israel has bombed and burned at least 36 hospitals across the enclave since the war erupted."}

The parts, however, would not be sent directly to Israel, the government said.Al-Haq and GLAN argue that the government is breaking domestic and international law through a loophole by allowing the parts to be supplied to Israel via the global spares pool and F-35 partner countries, \u201cdespite the [International Court of Justice] finding that there is plausible risk of genocide being committed against Palestinians in Gaza\u201d.The UK reportedly provides about 15 percent of the components in the F-35 fighter jets used by Israel.The case has taken on new significance after a report last week by the Palestinian Youth Movement, Progressives International and Workers for a Free Palestine suggested F-35 parts are still being sent directly to Israel as of March 2025.\u201cDespite the September 2024 suspension of direct shipments of F-35 components from the UK to Israel, the data suggest such shipments are ongoing as of March 2025\u201d, the report said, citing Israeli tax authority data.From Tuesday until Friday, High Court judges will examine whether the government\u2019s decision to suspend some but not all arms licences for export to Israel was legally correct.Al Jazeera understands the judicial review will focus on the carve-out for F-35 jet parts. The campaigners have said they aim to ensure the UK government \u201curgently suspends all arms exports to Israel\u201d, while accusing the UK of \u201ccomplicity\u201d in Israel\u2019s genocide against Palestinians.Co-claimants Al-Haq and GLAN applied for a judicial review into arms export licences to Israel in December 2023, citing violations carried out by Israel against Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.They say F-35 jets have plausibly been involved in war crimes.\u201cWe know Israel is using the F-35 jets to bomb civilians. For example [in] the attack on March 18 which broke the ceasefire, and this wouldn\u2019t be possible without the UK\u2019s help,\u201d Walker said.\u201cHundreds of civilians died,\u201d Walker said, referring to one of the deadliest days across Gaza when Israeli assaults killed more than 400 people. \u201cWe know every F-35 jet has some British parts.\u201dIn a statement sent to Al Jazeera, a spokesperson with the UK\u2019s Foreign Office said, \u201cThis government has suspended relevant licences for the [Israeli army] that might be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza.\u201dThe spokesperson added that of the remaining licences for Israel, the \u201cvast majority\u201d are not for the Israeli army but for \u201ccivilian purposes or re-export, and therefore are not used in the war in Gaza\u201d.The spokesperson reiterated the government\u2019s position that the F-35 programme exemption was \u201cdue to its strategic role in NATO and wider implications for international peace and security\u201d, adding that \u201cany suggestion that the UK is licensing other weapons for use by Israel in the war in Gaza is misleading\u201d.Oxfam, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are assisting the case by submitting written evidence.Oxfam\u2019s intervention is based on its documentation of the destruction caused by Israeli fire on water sanitation and health facilities.Akshaya Kumar, the director of crisis advocacy at Human Rights Watch, raised the idea of criminal responsibility, referencing the Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal.\u201cIf you are a supplier, you are aiding and abetting the continued assault, the continued air strikes. You are part of that criminal responsibility,\u201d she said.Elizabeth Rghebi, the MENA advocacy director at Amnesty International USA, argued that several states have either been unwilling to observe international legal obligations or have claimed that the structure of the F-35 programme makes it impossible to apply arms controls to the end-user, \u201cwhich would make the entire programme incompatible with international law\u201d.Israel\u2019s latest military assault on Gaza began shortly after October 7, 2023, when Hamas, the group that governs the Strip, led an incursion into southern Israel, during which 1,139 people were killed and more than 200 were taken captive.Israel has failed to achieve its stated aim of crushing Hamas, while its aerial bombardment from jets, including the F-35, has decimated civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, universities, libraries, mosques and churches.Emeritus professor Paul Rogers from the University of Bradford said, \u201cIn terms of tonnage dropped, most modern wars have had very high levels of tonnage used. Gaza is probably one of the worst. If you go back to the Second World War \u2013 [there was] the carpet bombing of German cities, the firebombing of Japanese cities, for that matter, and, on a smaller scale, the bombing Britain experienced during the second and third years of the war.\u201dHe added: \u201cSo, it\u2019s not exceptional in that sense, but the concentration of so much firepower in a very small area is very unusual. It bears comparison with some of the worst examples of modern warfare and their impact on civilians.\u201dThe World Health Organization (WHO) has documented the woes inflicted on Gaza\u2019s healthcare sector, including the systematic destruction of hospitals, withholding of medical supplies and the detention of doctors.\u201cAirstrikes and a lack of medical supplies, food, water and fuel have virtually depleted an already under-resourced health system,\u201d the WHO said.It added that 90 percent of housing units in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged. A similar percentage of school buildings require complete reconstruction or major rehabilitation."}

This nightmare, however, continues for the remaining hostages, their families, and hundreds of thousands of civilians across Gaza,\u201d Spoljaric said.Alexander\u2019s mother reportedly arrived in Israel on Monday and was flown to the Re\u2019im military base, where the two were expected to be reunited later in the evening, according to Al Jazeera\u2019s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan, because Al Jazeera is banned from Israel.Despite the release, Israel has made no commitment to a broader ceasefire. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in exchange, no release of Palestinian prisoners, no pause in the fighting,\u201d Salhut said. \u201cIf there are going to be any sort of negotiations, they\u2019re going to happen under fire,\u201d Salhut added, referring to the Israeli government\u2019s prevailing line.Akiva Eldar, an Israeli political analyst, said Alexander\u2019s release has spurred joy as well as frustration in Israel. \u201cWhat we see is that what President Trump can do, Netanyahu is not able \u2013 or not willing \u2013 to do,\u201d he told Al Jazeera from Tel Aviv.The Israeli prime minister has faced widespread calls to end the Gaza war to secure the captives\u2019 release but has said he plans to expand Israel\u2019s offensive.\u201cToday is a crucial point,\u201d Eldar explained. \u201cBecause the Israeli public is aware of the fact that if you want a deal, if you want your sons back at home, you can do it. But for that, you have to be a leader like President Trump and not like Netanyahu.\u201dAl Jazeera\u2019s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said there seems to be no change forthcoming in Palestinians\u2019 daily suffering: \u201cPalestinians are devastated. They\u2019re exhausted. Palestinian families are unable to feed their children. They\u2019re saying their children are going to bed hungry.\u201d\u201cThe IPC [Integrated Food Security Phase Classification] report issued today said 93 percent of Gaza\u2019s population is living through acute food insecurity. This is because of the blockade that has been imposed on the Gaza Strip,\u201d Khoudary said.\u201cPalestinians are asking, \u2018What\u2019s next? What is this release going to bring? Are there any positive negotiations? Is there any glimpse of hope of a ceasefire?'\u201d she added.And the bombardment continues, Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health said an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter killed at least 15 people on Monday.Humanitarian organisations have warned that Gaza is on the verge of mass starvation. The IPC reported that half a million Palestinians face imminent famine.According to the IPC, 70 days after Israel blocked entry of essential supplies, \u201cgoods indispensable for people\u2019s survival are either depleted or expected to run out in the coming weeks.\u201dThe head of the UN\u2019s World Food Programme, Cindy McCain, urged immediate international action. \u201cFamilies in Gaza are starving while the food they need is sitting at the border,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we wait until after a famine is confirmed, it will already be too late for many people.\u201dCatherine Russell, Executive Director of UNICEF, also issued a stark warning. \u201cThe risk of famine does not arrive suddenly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt unfolds in places where access to food is blocked, where health systems are decimated, and where children are left without the bare minimum to survive.\u201dHunger, she added, has become \u201ca daily reality for children across the Gaza Strip\u201d.Netanyahu and his hardline government remain committed to escalating the military campaign in Gaza.Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a key coalition partner, reiterated his position that the war must continue and humanitarian aid should be blocked from entering the territory.\u201cIsrael has not committed to a ceasefire of any kind,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office said in a statement, claiming military pressure had compelled Hamas to release Alexander.

Approximately 93 percent of Gaza\u2019s population is experiencing acute food shortages, it added.Conditions have significantly worsened since the previous IPC report, released in October, with a higher percentage of the population facing more severe levels of food insecurity.The entire population is expected to face \u201ccrisis\u201d or worse levels of acute food insecurity if the Israeli siege persists. One in five is thought likely to face starvation between May and September.Authorities in the bombarded territory said last week that at least 57 people had starved to death as a result of Israel\u2019s blockade.Widespread acute malnutrition is anticipated, the analysis adds, especially in mostly destroyed northern Gaza and in Rafah in the southernmost part of the Strip.\ud83d\udd34 #GazaStripThe Gaza Strip\u2014approximately 2.1 million people\u2014continues facing a critical risk of Famine following 19 months of conflict, mass displacement, and humanitarian aid blockade.\ud83d\udcc9 Extreme hunger is deepening every day!\u26a0\ufe0f 1 in every 5 people faces starvation between\u2026 pic.twitter.com/z7uN9ifnpC\u2014 The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (@theIPCinfo) May 12, 2025A continued blockade \u201cwould likely result in further mass displacement within and across governorates\u201d, the report said.\u201cThe vast majority of people in the Gaza Strip would not have access to food, water, shelter, and medicine. This would exacerbate civil unrest and competition over remaining scarce resources, further eroding whatever limited community coping and support mechanisms remain.\u201dFood prices in Gaza are soaring excessively.The IPC report points to a 3,000 percent increase in the price of wheat flour since February in Deir el-Balah in central Gaza and Khan Younis in the south.The analysis calls for \u201curgent action\u201d to end the hostilities, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and protect civilians and aid workers who have been killed by the Israeli army in record numbers.According to the latest figures on Monday by Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health, Israeli forces have killed at least 52,862 Palestinians and wounded 119,648 since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel, which killed an estimated 1,139 people and resulted in more than 200 people taken captive into Gaza."}

The attack never came.Whether these erratic actions are a reaction to the announced US ceasefire remains to be seen, but many analysts have spoken of a widening rift between Netanyahu and Trump.Netanyahu has reportedly expressed his frustration with Trump\u2019s Middle East policy in private conversations.He has been publicly against the US administration\u2019s talks with Iran, claiming there is no diplomatic way to resolve differences with Tehran, yet Iran and the US have continued their talks.He went on to blame Iran for the Houthis\u2019 attacks, claiming Israel\u2019s attacks are a message to the \u201cHouthis\u2019 sponsors\u201d.Trump, for his part, has seemed unconcerned.\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting Trump didn\u2019t say anything about [Houthi] attacks on Israel, which seem to be continuing amid this escalation,\u201d Nicholas Brumfield, a Yemen analyst, told Al Jazeera.\u201cIn [this] case, it\u2019s a US drawdown because the Houthis haven\u2019t been attacking international shipping,\u201d Brumfield said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been attacking Israel. The US has been doing its thing, and the Houthis have been targeting US ships.\u201dAfter Israeli attacks on Monday and Tuesday, which killed at least three people and wounded 35 others and damaged Hodeidah Port and Sanaa Airport, the Houthis promised retaliation.The attacks \u201cwill not go unanswered\u201d, the Houthi political bureau said in a statement.That kind of statement is typical of the Houthis, who have managed to weather more than a decade of attacks by forces with far superior military capabilities.Air strikes by the US and United Kingdom on Yemen in early 2024 were unable to stop the Houthis\u2019 attacks on Red Sea traffic.Years of air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition supporting Yemen\u2019s internationally recognised government taught the Houthis to keep their military infrastructure agile, analysts told Al Jazeera.A senior US government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera that recent US attacks on the Houthis have pushed leaders underground after the killing of some key military commanders.However, unlike under US President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, the attacks under Trump have been indiscriminate and have led to more civilian deaths. More than 250 people have been killed by US attacks on Yemen since mid-March, including at least 68 people at a centre housing detained African refugees and migrants in late April.Experts told Al Jazeera that despite the increased ferocity of those attacks, the Houthis have not been deterred.\u201cThe Houthis aren\u2019t going to stop,\u201d Brumfield said.The Houthis have made their stance clear vis-\u00e0-vis the agreement with the US and the continuation of attacks on Israel, which has also made clear that it plans to keep attacking.\u201cThe stated aim is to deter [the Houthis] or deplete their military capabilities to the point that the Houthis cannot target Israel any more, but these are both very unrealistic goals,\u201d Hannah Porter, an independent Yemen analyst, told Al Jazeera.Israel already considers that it has diminished the capabilities of two of its biggest foes, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, over the past 19 months.But trying something like that on the Houthis would be a vastly different challenge, she said.\u201cIsrael has probably not gathered the amount of intel on the Houthis that they have on Hamas or Hezbollah, so tracking and targeting leaders will be harder,\u201d Porter said.\u201cMore importantly, the geographic area is much larger in northern Yemen, meaning that there are far more potential targets.\u201d\u201cThe terrain is a factor, too,\u201d she added. \u201cNorthern Yemen is very mountainous with plenty of places to hide people and weapons.\u201dFor now, Israel and the Houthis seem intent on continuing their exchange of attacks. And the first to suffer will be the people of Yemen.Israel struck numerous targets in recent days in Yemen, including Sanaa\u2019s airport and the port in Hodeidah, which experts said is likely to exacerbate Yemen\u2019s dire humanitarian situation.Israel destroyed at least three civilian planes in the attacks.Yemen is already suffering one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises. More than 18.2 million people require humanitarian assistance and protection services, according to the United Nations.More than 17.1 million Yemenis suffer acute food shortages, and about five million are on the brink of famine.While analysts said Israel\u2019s attacks on ports will not be a \u201cknockout blow\u201d, they are among a matrix of factors that leave many Yemenis in an increasingly precarious position.\u201cThe humanitarian situation will just get worse,\u201d Raiman Al-Hamdani, a Yemen researcher with the international development company ARK, told Al Jazeera.\u201cDestroying the two main ports of northern Yemen, where the majority of the population lives, coupled with the FTO [\u201cforeign terrorist organisation\u201d] designation with cuts to the aid system around the world and the deteriorating economy \u2026 is a recipe for [unprecedented] humanitarian disaster.\u201d\u201c[Israel\u2019s attacks] are a continuation of its strategy. It\u2019s out of spite, targets civil infrastructure and the policy of creating human suffering,\u201d Al-Hamdani said.Both sides seem unwilling to stop, however.\u201cI cannot see anything quite good coming out of this unless the war Israel is waging on Gaza comes to some form of truce,\u201d Al-Hamdani said."}

Trump and Witkoff have frequently mentioned Alexander by name in the past few months.Witkoff later confirmed Hamas had agreed to release Alexander in the hopes of restarting ceasefire talks.Alexander, who grew up in the US, was taken from his military base during the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack.In its statement on Sunday, Hamas said it was willing to \u201cimmediately begin intensive negotiations\u201d that could lead to an agreement to end the war and would see Gaza under a technocratic and independent administration.\u201cThis will ensure calm and stability for many years, along with reconstruction and the end of the blockade,\u201d the group said.Qatar and Egypt, the two main mediators, welcomed Hamas\u2019 announcement, saying they considered the group\u2019s move a gesture of goodwill and an encouraging step toward the parties\u2019 return to ceasefire negotiations.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said on Sunday that the US told Israel that Hamas\u2019s freeing of Alexander would lead to negotiations for the release of more captives. The statement added that Israel\u2019s policy hasn\u2019t changed: negotiations will be conducted under fire with a continued commitment to achieving all war objectives.Al Jazeera\u2019s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan, said: \u201cIt\u2019s unclear exactly what kind of reaction the Israeli government officials had with these direct talks between Hamas and the United States, but last time they were quite angry and that\u2019s because the Israelis weren\u2019t involved and had no knowledge of those talks and the Americans hit back by saying they didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to negotiate with any of the actors involved because they were American captives held in Gaza\u201d.\u201cThere are a lot of questions from a lot of different angles, specifically from the family members of those captives, from the larger part of Israeli society who have been protesting in the thousands for more than 1.5 years, accusing Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the war for his own personal and political gain. And in fact, Israeli officials have been saying the quiet part out loud in recent weeks, saying that the captives were not the main priority for the Israeli government and that they had other goals and objectives they needed to achieve\u201d, she added.\u201cThe family members of captives say that the Israeli government is choosing land grabs over the lives of Israelis who are still being held in Gaza\u201d, she continued, referring to the Israeli government\u2019s decision to expand its offensive in Gaza with a view to reoccupying parts of the territory.Earlier on Sunday, two Hamas officials told the AFP news agency that talks were ongoing in the Qatari capital of Doha with the US and reported \u201cprogress\u201d had been made.One Hamas official, speaking about the talks with the US, said there was \u201cprogress made \u2026 notably on the entry of aid to the Gaza Strip\u201d and the potential exchange of captives for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.A second official also reported progress \u201con the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip\u201d.Israel shattered the last ceasefire, which lasted two months, on March 18, launching a major offensive in Gaza and ramping up its bombardment of the territory.It has also cut off all aid to Gaza since March 2, saying it would pressure Hamas to release the remaining captives. None have been released since the fleeting truce earlier this year, when several captives were exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.A total of 59 captives are still in Gaza, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.Starvation has taken hold across Gaza due to the Israeli blockade.Earlier this month, the Israeli government approved plans to expand its offensive in the Gaza Strip, with officials talking of retaining a long-term occupying presence there.The Health Ministry in Gaza said on Sunday that at least 2,720 people have been killed since Israel resumed its assault, bringing the overall Palestinian death toll since the war broke out to 52,829."}

enter the territory for 70 days due to Israel\u2019s blockade.The 2.3 million residents of Gaza are surviving on fast-dwindling supplies and charity kitchens, which have been gradually forced to shut down as they run out of food and hunger spreads.The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) warned on Sunday that the longer the blockade continues, the more irreversible harm is being done to Palestinians.\u201cUNRWA has thousands of trucks ready to enter and our teams in Gaza are ready to scale up the delivery,\u201d the organisation said.Hamas said in a statement on Sunday that Israel is committing a \u201ccomplex crime\u201d.Israel\u2019s security cabinet this month approved a plan to fully occupy the Gaza Strip and force another mass displacement of Palestinians.Israel has also proposed taking over any future humanitarian aid distribution, which would, it said, involve creating designated military zones.The Humanitarian Country Team, a forum that includes UN agencies, warned that the plan is dangerous and would \u201ccontravene fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic \u2013 as part of a military strategy\u201d.Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Sunday that the country would accept a new US mechanism that would start delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza.A group of American security contractors, former military officers and humanitarian aid officials is proposing to take over the distribution of food and other supplies in Gaza based on plans similar to those designed by Israel.The plan has been criticised for bypassing the UN and aid groups with expertise in aid delivery and creating only four distribution points that would force a large number of Palestinians to travel to southern Gaza.According to the latest figures by Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health on Sunday, at least 52,829 Palestinians have been confirmed killed and 119,554 wounded by Israeli military attacks since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel, which killed an estimated 1,139 people and resulted in more than 200 people taken captive into Gaza.Pope Leo XIV called for an immediate ceasefire, entry of humanitarian aid and release of all those held in Gaza during his first Sunday blessing since his election as pontiff.The Israeli military planned to intensify its ground occupation of Gaza on Sunday, pulling the Paratroopers Brigade back from its incursions into Syria to be redeployed to Gaza.The paratroopers have been operating in the occupied Golan Heights and inside Syria since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad in December.Israel withdrew the Nahal Brigade from the occupied West Bank \u2013 which has also been under assault for months \u2013 in its intended and self-proclaimed push to \u201cconquer\u201d Gaza.But thousands of Israeli reservists and other members of the Israeli military and security agencies, along with thousands of Israelis demonstrating in the streets, have been calling for an end to the war to bring back all captives.To address the growing dissatisfaction among soldiers, the Israeli government on Sunday approved a \u201ccomprehensive benefit plan\u201d for reservists worth about 3 billion shekels ($838m) that is slated to include a series of economic and social benefits.The army welcomed the plan approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying in a statement that it is a reflection of soldiers\u2019 \u201cexceptional contribution\u201d to Israeli society.This comes as United States President Donald Trump, who has reportedly had some differences with Netanyahu in recent weeks over the Gaza war and how to engage with Iran, will launch a tour of the Middle East this week."}

Last week, the former EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell accused Israel of committing genocide.Ozturk was joined by her lawyers and two of Massachusetts\u2019s Democratic members of Congress, Senator Edward Markey and Representative Ayanna Pressley.\u201cToday is a tremendous day as we welcome you back, Rumeysa,\u201d Markey said. \u201cYou have made millions and millions of people across our country so proud of the way you have fought.\u201dOzturk\u2019s lawyers say her visa was revoked without notice and she was not allowed to contact legal counsel for more than a day after her arrest.Appearing in court via video on Friday, Ozturk spoke of her deteriorating health, including severe asthma attacks in detention, and her hopes of continuing her doctoral research on children and social media.US District Judge William Sessions granted Ozturk bail, saying she presented no flight risk or danger to the public. He found that her claim of unlawful detention raised serious constitutional questions, including potential violations of her rights to free speech and due process.Ozturk\u2019s case highlights a practice that has become common under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Foreign students have been arrested and hundreds of their student visas revoked for their pro-Palestine views.Mahmoud Khalil, who led the protests against Israel\u2019s war on Gaza at Columbia University in New York, was among the first students detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on March 8. He remains in custody.The Trump administration has been accused of conflating criticism of Israel as anti-Semitism.A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson previously accused Ozturk, without evidence, of supporting Hamas, which has been designated as a \u201cterrorist\u201d group by the US.Ozturk denied any wrongdoing and said she will continue to pursue her case. \u201cI have faith in the American system of justice,\u201d she said.Her legal battle continues in Vermont while immigration hearings proceed separately in Louisiana, where she may participate remotely.Videos of her arrest, which show masked plainclothes officers taking her from a street in the Boston suburb of Somerville, Massachusetts, went viral and sent a chill across US university campuses.Her lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union argued that her arrest and detention were unlawfully designed to punish her for speech protected by the US Constitution\u2019s First Amendment and to chill the speech of others.Pressley, who with two other Democratic members of Congress from Massachusetts visited Ozturk while she was in custody, said she was held in \u201csqualid, inhumane conditions\u201d and denied proper medical care for worsening asthma attacks.\u201cRumeysa\u2019s experience was not just an act of cruelty. It was a deliberate, coordinated attempt to intimidate, to instil fear, to send a chilling message to anyone who dares to speak out against injustice,\u201d Pressley said."}

Two more civilians were injured in an attack on the al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, west of Rafah.In the past 24 hours, at least 23 Palestinians have been killed and 124 others injured in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip, according to the enclave\u2019s Ministry of Health.The attacks came amid Israel\u2019s continuing refusal to allow vital supplies into Gaza since March 2, leaving the enclave\u2019s 2.3 million residents dependent on a dwindling number of charity kitchens, which have been shutting down in recent days as food runs out.Reporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera\u2019s Hind Khoudary said: \u201cThere\u2019s barely food \u2026 We\u2019re talking about bakeries not operating, we\u2019re talking about zero distribution points and we\u2019re talking about only a few hot meal kitchens still operating.\u201dKhoudary said people queueing for hours would often leave empty-handed, with remaining kitchens stretching out food that would previously have fed 100 to serve up to 2,000 people.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more people dying, we\u2019re seeing more children dying due to malnutrition and the lack of food. But it\u2019s not only the lack of food, it\u2019s also the lack of medical supplies, it\u2019s the lack of fuel, cooking gas, and it\u2019s the lack of everything,\u201d she said.Among the charities shuttering operations, the United States-based World Central Kitchen said on Wednesday that it had been forced to close down because it no longer had supplies to bake bread or cook meals.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed for the blockade to be lifted.\u201cChildren are starving, and dying. Community kitchens are shutting down. Clean water is running out,\u201d it said on Friday in a post on X.The blockade is also having a devastating effect on people with chronic illnesses, depriving Palestinians who suffer from diabetes, cancer and rare conditions of life-saving medication.Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera\u2019s Hani Mahmoud said: \u201cDoctors here say the tragedy is not in what\u2019s happening, but in what is preventable.\u201d\u201cThese diseases have a treatment, but people of Gaza no longer have access to them, and they say that this is not just a failure of logistics, but of humanity,\u201d he added.Mahmoud spoke to the father of a 10-year-old boy suffering from diabetes, who said insulin was not available across northern Gaza.\u201cI spend entire days searching pharmacies, hoping to find it. Sometimes we hear that individuals might have it, so I go to their homes to barter,\u201d he said.Said al-Soudy, head of emergency in the oncology department of Gaza City\u2019s Al Helou International Hospital, told Al Jazeera: \u201cA large part of patients are struggling to find their essential medications. Without them, their health conditions deteriorate and may become life-threatening.\u201dPharmacist Rana Alsamak told Al Jazeera that Palestinians were unable to obtain medication for \u201cmultiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis, chronic illnesses and \u2026 immune-related diseases\u201d.\u201cThese conditions now go largely untreated,\u201d she said.On Friday, the US said it was establishing the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to coordinate aid deliveries into Gaza, with Israel providing military security for operations. The UN rejected the move, saying it would weaponise aid, violate principles of neutrality and cause mass displacement."}

Earlier this month, thousands of Israelis gathered outside the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv to protest against Netanyahu\u2019s decision to call up a further 60,000 reservists as part of his escalation against the bombed out and besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza, where his forces have already killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children.In mid-April, current and former members of the air force, considered one of Israel\u2019s elite units, also released a letter, claiming the war served the \u201cpolitical and personal interests\u201d of Netanyahu, \u201cand not security ones\u201d.Prompted by the air force, similar protests came from members of the navy, elite units within the military and Israel\u2019s foreign security agency, Mossad.Political and personal interests Accusations that Netanyahu is manipulating the war for his own personal ends predate the breaking of the ceasefire.In the minds of his critics, the longer the war continues, the longer Netanyahu feels he can defend himself against the numerous threats to his position and even his freedom.In addition to facing trial on numerous counts of corruption dating back to 2019, he also faces calls to hold an inquiry into the government\u2019s political failings before the October 7 attack.Netanyahu also faces accusations that members of his office have allegedly been taking payment from Qatar \u2013 the Gulf state has previously dismissed the allegations as a \u201csmear campaign\u201d intended to hinder efforts to mediate an end to the conflict.The continuation of the war allows Netanyahu to distract from those issues, while maintaining a coalition with far-right parties who have made it clear that any end to the war without total victory \u2013 which increasingly appears to include the ethnic cleansing of Gaza \u2013 would result in their departure from government, and Netanyahu\u2019s likely fall.And so there are questions about whether Netanyahu\u2019s announcement of a further escalation in Gaza, including the occupation of territory and displacement of its population, will mark an end to the conflict, or simply bog Israel down in the kind of forever war that has so far been to Netanyahu\u2019s benefit.\u2018I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re capable of occupying the territory,\u201d former US Special Forces commander, Colonel Seth Krummrich of international security firm Global Guardian told Al Jazeera, \u201cGaza is just going to soak up people, and that\u2019s before you even think about guarding northern Israel, confronting Iran or guarding the Israeli street,\u201d he said, warning of the potential shortfall in reservists.\u201cIt\u2019s also competing with a tide of growing [domestic] toxicity. When soldiers don\u2019t return home, or don\u2019t go, that\u2019s going to tear at the fabric of Israeli society. It plays out at every dinner table.\u201dStaying at home Israeli media reports suggest that part of that toxicity is playing out in the number of reservists simply not showing up for duty.The majority of those refusing service are thought to be \u201cgrey refusers\u201d. That is, reservists with no ideological objection to the mass killings in Gaza, but rather ones exhausted by repeated tours, away from their families and jobs to support a war with no clear end.Official numbers of reservists refusing duty are unknown. However, in mid-March, the Israeli national broadcaster, Kan, ran a report disputing official numbers, which claimed that more than 80 percent of those called up for duty had attended, suggesting that the actual figure was closer to 60 percent.\u201cThere has been a steady increase in refusal among reservists,\u201d a spokesperson for the organisation New Profile, which supports people refusing enlistment, said. \u201cHowever, we often see sharp spikes in response to specific shifts in Israeli government policy, such as the violation of the most recent ceasefire or public statements by officials indicating that the primary objective of the military campaign is no longer the return of hostages and \u2018destruction of Hamas\u2019, as initially claimed, but rather the occupation of Gaza, and its ethnic cleansing.\u201dAlso unaddressed is growing public discontent over the ultra-religious Haredi community, whose eight-decade exemption from military service was deemed illegal by the Supreme Court in June of last year.Despite the shortfall in reservists reporting for duty and others having experienced repeated deployments, in April, the Supreme Court requested an explanation from Netanyahu \u2013 who relies upon Haredi support to maintain his coalition \u2013 as to why its ruling had not been fully implemented or enforced.Throughout the war, Netanyahu\u2019s escalations, while often resisted by the captives\u2019 families and their allies, have been cheered on and encouraged by his allies among the far-right, many of whom claim a biblical right to the homes and land of Palestinians.The apparent conflict between the welfare of the captives and the \u201ctotal victory\u201d promised by Netanyahu has run almost as long as the conflict itself, with each moment of division seemingly strengthening the prime minister\u2019s position through the critical support of the ultranationalist elements of his cabinet.Netanyahu\u2019s position has led to conflict with politicians, including his own former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. While Gallant wasn\u2019t opposed to the war in principle \u2013 his active support for Netanyahu eventually led to him joining Netanyahu in facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for war crimes \u2013 his prioritisation of the captives put him at odds with the prime minister.The divide over priorities has meant that civility between the government and the captives\u2019 families has increasingly gone out the window, with Netanyahu generally avoiding meeting families with loved ones still captive in Gaza, and far-right politicians engaging in shouting matches with them during meetings in parliament.Division within Israeli society was not new, Professor Yossi Mekelberg of Chatham House told Al Jazeera, \u201cbut wars and conflicts deepen them\u201d.\u201cNow we have a situation where some people have served anywhere up to 400 days in the army [as reservists], while others are refusing to serve at all and exploiting their political power within the coalition to do so,\u201d Mekelberg added.\u201cElsewhere, there are ministers on the extreme right talking about \u2018sacrificing\u2019 the hostages for military gain,\u201d something Mekelberg said many regarded as running counter to much of the founding principles of the country and the Jewish faith.\u201cThere\u2019s such toxicity in public discourse,\u201d Mekelberg continued, \u201cWe see toxicity against anyone who criticises the war or the prime minister, division between the secular and the religious, and then even divisions within the religious movements.\u201d"}

At least 22 Palestinians were killed in a series of attacks on Friday, medical sources in Gaza told Al Jazeera. They include a mother and child in Al Nuseirat Refugee Camp in central Gaza, and a father and son killed in Khan Younis in the south.US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told reporters on Friday that Israel would not be involved in distributing aid in the enclave but would provide security for the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).The plan for the \u201ccharitable\u201d and \u201cnon-governmental\u201d initiative was announced on Thursday by State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce. Although few details were revealed, it appears part of a US-Israeli push to take over the distribution of aid to prevent it from being diverted by Hamas and other groups.The AP news agency reported that the newly created GHF had issued a proposal to implement a new aid distribution system, supplanting the current one run by the United Nations and other international aid agencies.Reports claim that under the proposal, private contractors will be used to secure hubs where Palestinians will be required to gather to collect supplies.Israel, which has halted the entry of all aid to Gaza since March 2, deepening the humanitarian crisis, has previously said it will not relax the blockade until a system is in place that gives it control over the distribution, insisting that supplies are used to support Hamas.The intention to sideline the UN has drawn sharp criticism from humanitarian organisations, and it is unclear if the GHF proposal will ease those concerns.\u201cThere\u2019s only one word to describe this, and this is aid-washing. This is a cynical attempt by the state of Israel and its allies \u2026 to use aid to hide the fact that what\u2019s actually going on is people are being starved into submission,\u201d Chris Gunness, a former UNWRA \u2013 the UN agency for Palestinian refugees \u2013 spokesperson, told Al Jazeera.\u201cThey\u2019re being starved as a part of the mass and illegal force displacement, which is very much part of Israel\u2019s genocidal ambitions against the Palestinians.\u201dGunness added that the proposal is also an \u201cattempt by Israel to destroy UNRWA\u201d, stating that UNRWA is the only organisation that has the infrastructure, the staff, the vehicles, the food distribution centres and warehouses \u201cto stave off mass starvation in Gaza\u201d.The US State Department\u2019s Bruce promised further announcements regarding the proposal would follow soon.\u201cI was hoping to introduce it today, but the foundation will be announcing this shortly,\u201d she said.The former executive director of the UN World Food Programme David Beasley is in talks with the US, Israel and other key players to head the GHF, reported US outlet Axis, quoting unnamed sources.Israel\u2019s blockade, implemented about two weeks before it resumed its bombardment of the enclave, has left Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million Palestinians, most of whom have been displaced multiple times, desperately short of food, fuel, and medicine.The US plan appears to be designed along similar lines to a proposal approved by Israel\u2019s security cabinet on Sunday.Under the scheme, four \u201cSecure Distribution Sites\u201d would be constructed, each intended to serve 300,000 people. Palestinians expelled from northern Gaza would be forced to relocate to reach the centres.The plan was met by sharp criticism from the UN and other aid groups, who noted that Palestinians have regularly come under attack from Israeli forces while collecting aid.Addressing those concerns, Huckabee on Friday said \u201cthe most significant danger is not doing anything\u201d and \u201cpeople dying from hunger\u201d.The aid would be \u201cdistributed effectively, but also safely\u201d, the US official insisted, according to Israeli daily Haaretz.The decision to bypass international aid agencies comes amid growing alarm over famine-like conditions in the besieged territory, where Israel\u2019s near-total blockade has cut off all essential supplies for almost three months.At least 57 Palestinians have starved to death in Gaza, with most of the victims being children, as well as the sick and elderly.UN humanitarian agency spokesperson Jens Laerke condemned the effort to dismantle existing aid structures on Tuesday.\u201cThis appears to be a deliberate attempt to weaponise the aid,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be based solely on humanitarian need.\u201d"}

It also offers the clearest picture yet of the Biden administration\u2019s political manoeuvring as public pressure mounted for accountability.Abu Akleh was a US citizen, and during her final reporting assignment, she wore both a helmet and a blue vest clearly labelled with the word \u201cpress\u201d to indicate her status as a journalist.In the aftermath of her killing, the Biden administration faced pressure to investigate the circumstances of her death and whether the shooting was intentional.But while the administration initially called for an \u201cindependent, credible investigation\u201d, it shifted its stance as the months progressed. It walked back calls for the killer to be \u201cprosecuted\u201d and eventually described the shooting as \u201cthe result of tragic circumstances\u201d.It also eased its scrutiny of the Israeli military, calling for accountability only in the form of a review of its \u201crules of engagement\u201d.The documentary Who Killed Shireen? features interviews from former Washington insiders about why the Biden administration made such a pivot. Its most damaging testimony comes from an anonymous official, who spoke with his face and voice obscured.In the film, the official claims the evidence available to the Biden administration indicated that Abu Akleh\u2019s death \u201cwas an intentional killing\u201d. He said that assessment was based on the \u201cvisual capabilities of that day\u201d and the distance between the Israeli snipers and the journalists who were shot.Another journalist, Ali al-Samoudi, was also wounded at the same time as Abu Akleh, though he survived his gunshot.\u201cWhether or not they knew it was her [Abu Akleh] or not can very well be debated, but they would have absolutely known it was a media person or a noncombatant at a minimum that [the Israeli soldier] shot and killed,\u201d the anonymous Biden official said.He added that it was his \u201cbelief\u201d that the shooter would have been able to see Abu Akleh\u2019s blue \u201cpress\u201d jacket.The official acknowledged the shift in the Biden administration\u2019s position, from viewing the shooting as \u201can intentional killing\u201d to describing it as \u201ca tragic accident\u201d. He linked that about-face to the historically close ties the US has shared with Israel.\u201cUltimately, I think what it came down to was different pressure within the administration to not try to anger the government of Israel too much, by trying to force their hand at saying they intentionally killed a US citizen,\u201d the official said.Another former US official, Andrew Miller, also spoke to filmmakers as part of the documentary. Miller served as the deputy secretary of state for Israeli-Palestinian Affairs from 2022 to 2024, and he indicated that the Biden administration had not been forthcoming about the stonewalling it faced from the Israeli government.He said the government of then-Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett refused to allow the US access to the soldier who fired the fatal shot, even for \u201cinformal\u201d questioning.Miller also cast doubt on Israeli claims that Abu Akleh was shot during a crossfire with Palestinian fighters. He explained that the Biden administration had information from the start that contradicted those claims.\u201cThe fact that the official Israeli position remains that this was a case of crossfire \u2026 [that] the entire episode was a mistake \u2014 as opposed to potentially a mistake in identification or the deliberate targeting of this individual \u2014 points to, I think, a broader policy of seeking to manage the narrative,\u201d Miller said.The Biden administration had never publicly contradicted Israel\u2019s assessment. Instead, when the Israeli military released its final report on the killing in September 2022, it said it \u201cwelcomed\u201d the assessment.That report asserted that Abu Akleh was \u201caccidentally hit\u201d by an Israeli bullet \u201cduring an exchange of fire in which life-risking, widespread and indiscriminate shots were fired toward\u201d Israeli soldiers.To date, the US government has never declassified a State Department report on the killing or confirmed media reports that the Department of Justice was conducting a separate probe.Rights groups, press freedom organisations, and lawmakers have long called the Biden administration\u2019s response inadequate, appealing for greater transparency and for the US to withhold aid to the military unit responsible.Advocates said the latest revelations underscore a continued cycle of impunity.\u201cThe US government has acted as an accomplice to Israeli war crimes, not only against Palestinians but Americans, too, trumping loyalty to its own laws and citizens,\u201d said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the human rights organisation Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), in a statement responding to the documentary."}

There were similar reports about both sides of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022.At the time, DJI suspended all sales to both countries and introduced software modifications that restricted the areas where its drones could be used and how high they could fly.However, DJI has not stopped selling drones to Israel.The Israeli army\u2019s use of DJI drones is not new.By 2018, DJI drones were reportedly in extensive use across numerous divisions in the Israeli military. The Israeli campaign group Hamushim found evidence that Israeli military-trained operators were using DJI\u2019s Matrice 600 model to drop tear gas on civilian protesters during the following year\u2019s Great March of Return in Gaza.Despite their previous deployment by the Israeli military, their lethal use against civilians and protected targets in Gaza, as documented in this investigation, is unprecedented.Al Jazeera has reached out to Israeli authorities to request comment on the findings of this investigation but has received no response by time of publication.Sanad has documented several DJI drones that have been adapted for military use.However, it is the powerful DJI Agras drone, developed for agricultural use, that is the most significant.According to its manufacturers, the DJI Agras can carry a substantial payload and is capable of precision flight.As Sanad\u2019s investigation shows, it can also be used to deliver an explosive payload to targets beyond the reach of conventional military forces.In addition to the DJI Agras, the DJI Mavic has been used by the Israeli military across Gaza for reconnaissance and target acquisition.Similarly, the compact DJI Avata drone, designed for recreational filming, has been repurposed by the Israeli military to navigate and map the intricate tunnel networks beneath Gaza.By late 2024, Israel had laid siege to Gaza\u2019s north, pushing the population to the brink of famine and imposing conditions described as \u201capocalyptic\u201d by United Nations observers.Residents and humanitarian organisations reported an alarming number of what appeared to be civilian drones armed with explosives.In an incident documented by displaced civilians, footage shared on July 17, 2024, shows a DJI Agras drone dropping a bomb onto the IHH Turkish charity\u2019s building in Jabalia, northern Gaza, less than 100 metres (330ft) from a school serving as a shelter and aid distribution centre.In November in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, a DJI Agras drone dropped a bomb in a residential neighbourhood where civilians had fled after Israeli shelling of a UN-operated school-turned-shelter.People who witnessed the bombing told Sanad the attack seemed calculated to instil fear.Beyond direct attacks, Israeli-modified DJI drones have been used extensively for surveillance and tactical operations throughout Gaza.In a further incident, footage obtained by Al Jazeera Arabic from one Israeli drone shows a DJI Avata helping to track an unnamed Palestinian being used by heavily armed Israeli soldiers as a human shield \u2013 an illegal practice under international law \u2013 in Shujaiya in December 2023.The individual is seen opening the school\u2019s doors to make sure there were no Palestinian fighters inside, closely monitored by another drone that captured the entire operation.In 2022, in response to complaints from Ukrainian officials that DJI was sharing critical data with their Russian adversaries, the drone manufacturer suspended all sales to its retail partners in both countries.DJI explained the move: \u201cWe will never accept any use of our products to cause harm, and we will continue striving to improve the world with our work.\u201dDespite evidence of DJI drones being weaponised by the Israeli military in Gaza, DJI has had no such response.Responding to direct inquiries from Sanad, DJI said: \u201cOur products are for peaceful and civilian use only, and we absolutely deplore and condemn the use of [DJI] products to cause harm anywhere in the world.\u201dA subsequent direct query asked if it plans \u201cto halt sales in Israel or implement measures similar to those taken in the Russia-Ukraine conflict\u201d.But DJI did not respond to the query not has it undertaken any measures to halt sales or impose software restrictions on where drones can fly over Gaza, allowing continued military deployments of their drones by the Israeli military."}

However, both sides have accused each other of violating the agreement.Israel still occupies five strategic hilltops along the border. While rockets have been fired into Israel from Lebanese territory on two separate occasions, Hezbollah has denied involvement.The recent escalation marks a sharp intensification of the conflict, rooted in Hezbollah\u2019s support for Hamas during Israel\u2019s ongoing war on Gaza.Hezbollah\u2019s deputy leader, Naim Qassem, has maintained that the group no longer keeps weapons in the border zone, in accordance with the truce."}

There has been heavy fighting in the area, they said.Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reports from Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, that Hamas\u2019s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades says it is engaging in \u201cfierce point-blank clashes and confrontations with Israeli occupation forces operating in the El Geneina neighbourhood east of Rafah city\u201d.\u201cThere are more reports that a number of Israeli forces are trapped under the rubble of a building that had been previously rigged by explosives by Hamas in Rafah city.

In Shujayea, east of Gaza City, shelling killed another person and wounded several others.Further north, Israeli warplanes targeted a home in Beit Lahiya, killing nine. Rescuers were still searching for a woman believed to be trapped beneath the rubble.The attack site in Beit Lahiya was \u201cfull of displaced people\u201d, said Mahmoud earlier.\u201cThe owner of this residential home and the displaced people he hosted were killed inside this residential home,\u201d he said. \u201cMany others were reported with severe injuries and burns and transferred to the Indonesian Hospital, which is already overwhelmed.\u201cOne single family just lost nine family members, including women and children, and more people are missing and trapped under the rubble.\u201dIn Khan Younis, one girl was killed and four others wounded after Israeli artillery hit tents sheltering displaced families in the western part of the city.The continuing assault on Gaza comes amid growing alarm that Israel\u2019s total blockade of aid is pushing the enclave into famine.The U.S. State Department said on Thursday a solution to be able to deliver food aid to Gaza was \u201csteps away\u201d, although it did not detail what the plan would entail.European leaders and aid groups have criticized purported Israeli plans to take over distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza and use private companies to get food to families after more than two months in which Israel has prevented supplies entering the besieged territory.Israel\u2019s blockade on Gaza \u2013 tightened on March 2 \u2013 has pushed the population deeper into crisis, cutting off aid and crippling humanitarian relief. On Wednesday, World Central Kitchen (WCK), one of the key food providers in Gaza, announced it had halted all cooking operations.\u201cWe have no more food to prepare,\u201d the aid group said, after exhausting flour and other basic supplies needed to run its soup kitchens and mobile bakeries. WCK had been providing at least 130,000 meals and 80,000 loaves of bread daily.\u201cThe trucks are ready in Egypt, Jordan and Israel,\u201d said WCK founder Jose Andres. \u201cBut they cannot move without permission. Humanitarian aid must be allowed to flow.\u201dThe World Food Programme previously warned that its food stocks in Gaza had run dry, ending a vital lifeline for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. The continuing blockade, aid agencies say, has accelerated the onset of famine. Malnutrition is now widespread, with humanitarian workers warning they can no longer treat or prevent hunger-related illnesses.Rights groups have condemned the blockade as a \u201cstarvation tactic\u201d and argue it may constitute a war crime.Sean Carroll, president of Anera (American Near East Refugee Aid), told Al Jazeera that Gaza\u2019s humanitarian crisis has reached a critical point, with aid deliveries plummeting. \u201cWe were delivering nearly a million meals a week, and we\u2019ve only delivered a few thousand in the past 66 days,\u201d he said, noting that stocks are depleted.\u201cI think governments have to use every diplomatic lever, every political lever, every economic lever to convince all parties that there needs to be a return to some semblance of delivering humanitarian aid. We are losing our humanity here,\u201d said Carroll.Scenes at the few remaining open aid centres are increasingly chaotic. Children, women and men jostle for shrinking rations as food distribution systems break down. Bakeries have shut and fuel shortages have left water distribution networks paralysed.Elsewhere, tensions have flared beyond Gaza, with Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz warning Iran that it could face the same fate as Hamas and Hezbollah. His remarks followed a Houthi drone attack near Israel\u2019s Ben Gurion Airport.\u201cYou are directly responsible,\u201d Katz said on Thursday. \u201cWhat we have done to Hezbollah in Beirut, to Hamas in Gaza, we will do to you in Tehran, too.\u201dYemen\u2019s Houthi rebels launched a ballistic missile that struck near Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv on Sunday, saying the attack was in support of Palestinians in Gaza.The strike disrupted flights and prompted Israel to launch air strikes on Sanaa International Airport and power stations in Houthi-controlled areas, killing at least one and injuring dozens, according to Houthi reports.Iran denied backing the Houthi assault. Despite a United States-Houthi ceasefire mediated by Oman on Tuesday, ensuring \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d in the Red Sea, Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree said, \u201cWe will carry out more military operations against the Israeli enemy,\u201d targeting Israel and its ships."}

During the meeting, the official said President Donald Trump is increasingly frustrated with Israel\u2019s stance on the stalled ceasefire talks.Trump intends to press ahead with the Saudi deal regardless of Israel\u2019s position, said the report on Wednesday.The US president is expected to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates next week. Meanwhile, Israel\u2019s ambassador to Washington is lobbying the White House to add a brief stop in Israel, two Israeli officials told Axios.According to The Jerusalem Post, the US official told attendees Israel could face \u201ca much heavier price\u201d if it continues to oppose a ceasefire deal.\u201cPresident Trump is determined to move forward with a significant deal with Saudi Arabia, even without Israeli involvement,\u201d the official reportedly said. \u201cThe ceasefire agreement with the Houthis is just a prelude. If Israel doesn\u2019t come to its senses, even the \u2018Deal of the Millennium\u2019 will happen without it.\u201dThe report said families of the captives hoped the meeting would result in greater international pressure on Israeli leaders to act. Some attendees said they were alarmed by the unusually blunt tone from the official as Washington has long been viewed as Israel\u2019s closest diplomatic ally.The Trump administration has sought to realign regional alliances, focusing on normalising ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia. \u201cWe hope Israel will board the historic train that has already left the station,\u201d the US official reportedly said. \u201cBut the US will not wait at the platform.\u201dThe official also echoed concerns from the families that ongoing Israeli military operations could endanger the captives.The proposed US-Saudi Arabia-Israel deal aims to normalise ties between Riyadh and Tel Aviv in what would mark a historic diplomatic shift, brokered by Washington.Building on the controversial 2020 Abraham Accords, the agreement would see Saudi Arabia formally recognise Israel \u2013 abandoning its long-held demand for a full Israeli withdrawal from occupied Palestinian territory as outlined in the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative.In return, the US would offer Saudi Arabia a defence pact and access to advanced weapons, while urging Riyadh to scale back its growing ties with China and Russia.Another pillar of the deal includes US support for a Saudi civil nuclear programme, though disagreements over uranium enrichment remain unresolved.While Saudi Arabia originally insisted on concrete steps towards a two-state solution for Palestinians, recent reports suggest Riyadh may settle for symbolic concessions \u2013 such as freezing settlement expansion \u2013 if the US offers enough in return."}

The Trump administration has accused Ozturk of having \u201cengaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans\u201d, though it has not offered evidence.After she was detained outside her home, Ozturk was reportedly whisked across state borders, first to Vermont and later to Louisiana, all within a 24-hour period, according to her lawyers.Critics have described those rapid transfers as a means of subverting due process, separating foreign students from family, friends and legal resources they can otherwise draw upon.In Ozturk\u2019s case, the confusion led her lawyers to file a petition for her release in Massachusetts, as they did not know where she was when they submitted the paperwork.On April 18, a lower court ruled that Ozturk must be returned to Vermont no later than May 1, as it weighed her habeas petition: a type of complaint that challenges the legality of one\u2019s detention.\u201cNo one should be arrested and locked up for their political views. Every day that Rumeysa Ozturk remains in detention is a day too long,\u201d Bhandari, her lawyer, said in a statement.But the Trump administration appealed, seeking an emergency stay of Ozturk\u2019s transfer to Vermont.The Second Circuit Court of Appeals rejected (PDF) that request, however. It said the government had failed to show any \u201cirreparable harm\u201d that Ozturk\u2019s transfer would cause.\u201cFaced with such a conflict between the government\u2019s unspecific financial and administrative concerns on the one hand, and the risk of substantial constitutional harm to Ozturk on the other, we have little difficulty concluding \u2018that the balance of hardships tips decidedly\u2019 in her favor,\u201d the court wrote.Though Ozturk is expected to be transferred to Vermont, where her habeas petition will be heard, the Trump administration is slated to continue with deportation proceedings in Louisiana.The appeals court, however, explained that this should be no challenge for the Trump administration, given that Ozturk can appear through video conference for those hearings.\u201cThe government asserts that it would face difficulties in arranging for Ozturk to appear for her immigration proceedings in Louisiana remotely,\u201d the court wrote. \u201cBut the government has not disputed that it is legally and practically possible for Ozturk to attend removal proceedings remotely.\u201dThe Trump administration has the option of appealing the decision to the Supreme Court.Likewise, Khalil faces deportation proceedings in Louisiana while his habeas petition is heard in New Jersey, closer to his home in New York City.On March 8, he became the first high-profile case of a student protester being arrested for deportation. Agents for Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrived at his student housing building at Columbia University, where his wife, a US citizen, filmed him being handcuffed and led away.Khalil himself was a US permanent resident who recently graduated from Columbia\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs. He is of Palestinian descent.On Tuesday, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in New Jersey rejected a bid by the Trump administration to transfer Khalil\u2019s habeas petition to Louisiana.And on Wednesday, US District Court Judge Michael Farbiarz ordered the Trump administration to provide a specific assessment of the risks Khalil poses by being in the US.Trump\u2019s Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cited Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to justify Khalil\u2019s detention and deportation. A rarely used provision of the law allows secretaries of state to remove noncitizens who could cause \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\u201d.But Rubio has so far been vague about what those consequences might be in Khalil\u2019s case. The student protest leader has been charged with no crime.Judge Farbiarz also required the Trump team to supply a catalogue of every case in which US officials have employed that law. The Trump administration is expected to appeal that judge\u2019s order as well."}

Palestinians will be forced to move \u2013 or starve.Some 5,000 to 6,000 families will be pushed into each camp, according to The Washington Post. Each household will send someone to trek miles to pick up a weekly food parcel from what the Norwegian Refugee Council\u2019s Jan Egeland called \u201cconcentration hubs\u201d.It is unclear how the rest of the population \u2013 possibly some 1.5 million people \u2013 will eat.Israel says it will use facial recognition to identify people picking up food parcels, to deny aid to \u201cHamas\u201d \u2013 yet Israel treats every fighting-age male as a Hamas operative.The private security companies from the United States would also guard within the designated areas.Experts and UN agencies are decrying the plan as impractical and inhumane.Israel\u2019s genocidal war on Gaza continues, and Palestinians will continue to suffer.Since Israel began its war on Gaza on October 7, 2023, it has cloaked its mass expulsions in what it claims are humane \u201cadvance warnings\u201d in which families have mere hours to pack their belongings and flee to a zone Israel determines. Israel often bombs those safe zones anyway.\u201cIf you are viewing this plan through aid distribution, it makes no sense,\u201d Diana Buttu, legal scholar and former adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization, told Al Jazeera.\u201cIf you view it through a political project, which is ethnic cleansing and cantonisation by using food as a weapon of war, then this plan does make sense,\u201d she said, adding that the \u201cplan\u201d is consistent with Israel\u2019s aim of carrying out a genocide in Gaza.That they are afraid, and starving, after two months of Israel blocking all aid and regular shipments of food.\u201cIf there is a plan to expand the war and reoccupy Gaza and repeat the displacement, why were we allowed to return to the north again?\u201d Noor Ayash, 31, asks.\u201cWhat more does Netanyahu want? We\u2019re dying in every way.\u201dMahmoud al-Nabahin, 77, who has been displaced for the past 18 months, says Netanyahu\u2019s threats are meaningless.He has lost everything; Israel killed his wife and daughter in a raid months ago, and their home and farm are gone.\u201c[This] means nothing but our annihilation. We\u2019ve lost all hope. Let him do whatever he wants,\u201d he says from his tent in Deir el-Balah.\u201cWe don\u2019t have weapons. We\u2019re civilians left in the wind. People will refuse displacement, but will be forced by the army.\u201dThey want to finish their genocide under the guise of facilitating food aid and rescuing Israeli captives, Omar Rahman, an expert on Israel-Palestine for the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said.\u201cIsrael has been telegraphing its real intentions from the start of this campaign: Destroy Gaza and eliminate its population both by starvation and mass killing,\u201d he said.Israel\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d signals its intent to starve Palestinians who resist being expelled from north Gaza, said Heidi Matthews, a legal scholar at York University, Canada.\u201cIt is inconceivable that the population can be adequately provided for \u2026 whilst being crowded into southern Gaza,\u201d she said.\u201cThis indicates the genocidal intent to inflict on the Palestinian population of Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201dNot clear.Israel plans to hire two US private security firms, Safe Reach Solutions and UG Solutions, to provide security and possibly help with food distribution.The first is headed by Phil Riley, a former CIA intelligence officer. The second is run by Jameson Govoni, a former member of the US Army Special Forces.These companies could give Israel plausible deniability if abuses or atrocities occur, said Mairav Zonszein, an expert on Israel-Palestine for the International Crisis Group.She added that Israel will also call up thousands of reservists to maintain a physical occupation over northern Gaza, despite many soldiers being fatigued by war and financial troubles.\u201cThere is definitely a lower \u2026 turnout among reservists than at the start of the war. But that doesn\u2019t mean there is actually a manpower shortage,\u201d Zonszein told Al Jazeera.In addition, she noted, despite Israeli society opposing expanding the war on Gaza without first retrieving the captives, Netanyahu is more concerned with appeasing far-right ministers in his coalition by fighting on.Netanyahu risks losing power and standing trial for corruption charges if the coalition collapses.Not UN agencies.A UN spokesman said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was \u201calarmed\u201d by Israel\u2019s plan and that it will \u201cinevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza\u201d.\u201cGaza is, and must remain, an integral part of a future Palestinian state,\u201d said spokesman Farhan Haq.The UN also issued a statement saying Israel\u2019s plan for Gaza would \u201ccontravene fundamental humanitarian principles\u201d and deepen suffering for civilians.But the UN may conclude that it must participate in Israel\u2019s scheme out of fear that even more Palestinians in Gaza will starve if it doesn\u2019t, said Buttu, putting the onus on Western states, who primarily fund UN agencies, to support the UN\u2019s position by sanctioning Israel."}

The only exemption is the F-35 programme due to its strategic role in NATO and wider implications for international peace and security,\u201d the ministry said.\u201cAny suggestion that the UK is licensing other weapons for use by Israel in the war in Gaza is misleading.\u201d\u201cThe UK totally opposes an expansion of Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza.

The Palestinian Civil Defence agency said on Tuesday night that more than 30 people had been killed and dozens wounded there.Mahmoud said Palestinians were \u201cscrambling for cover\u201d as air strikes and explosions struck residential buildings and evacuation centres across Gaza.\u201cWe have confirmed that a farmer was killed in the eastern part of Khan Younis, in Abasan, as he was trying to harvest what he managed to plant in the past couple of months, making up for the lack of food,\u201d Mahmoud said.\u201cThis is one of the elements that we have been seeing quite visibly. Not only are they suffering on a daily basis because of the enforced starvation and dehydration, they [also] try to plant their own food, but they are deprived, and their abilities to do so are [thwarted] by the ongoing attacks,\u201d he added.The intensified attacks have been compounded by an Israeli blockade on essential supplies since March 2, leaving the enclave deprived of fuel and food, including flour. Aid groups have said food supplies are close to total depletion.The United States-based World Central Kitchen charity said it has halted work in the Gaza Strip after it was prevented by Israel from bringing in aid and ran out of supplies.\u201cAfter serving more than 130 million total meals and 26 million loaves of bread over the past 18 months, World Central Kitchen no longer has the supplies to cook meals or bake bread in Gaza,\u201d it said on Wednesday in a post on X.A mother of six sheltering at a facility run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) told the agency her family only had bread after they had run out of all other types of food.\u201cThe State of Israel must lift the siege,\u201d UNRWA wrote on X on Wednesday.\u201cThere must be a concerted international effort to stop this humanitarian catastrophe from reaching a new unseen level,\u201d it added.Gaza\u2019s health sector is also bearing the brunt of the ongoing attacks and blockade. At least 88 percent of beds in hospitals are occupied, and their staffs are trying to treat patients as they face shortages of medical supplies.On Wednesday, Egypt and Qatar, which both mediated this year\u2019s ceasefire alongside the US, reaffirmed their commitment to an agreement aimed at ending the \u201cunprecedented humanitarian crisis and alleviating the suffering of civilians by fostering the necessary conditions for achieving a comprehensive ceasefire\u201d.\u201cThe two countries emphasise that attempts to sow discord among brotherly nations \u2013 whether through the casting of doubt, distortion, or media escalation \u2013 will not succeed, nor will they deter the two nations from continuing their joint efforts to end the war and the resulting humanitarian catastrophe,\u201d a joint statement read, adding that the countries were working with the US to reach a deal.While Israel announced that a more intense military offensive would begin in Gaza unless a ceasefire was signed, Hamas said the talks were pointless.\u201cThere is no sense in engaging in talks or considering new ceasefire proposals as long as the hunger war and extermination war continue in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Hamas official Basem Naim told the AFP news agency on Tuesday."}

Shortly after the tents started popping up, the campus also witnessed some of the first mass arrests of student protesters in the Palestinian solidarity movement.That visibility has made Columbia a focal point for President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to crack down on what he called \u201cillegal protests\u201d and campus anti-Semitism.Earlier this year, Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil became the first student activist to be detained by the Trump administration and targeted for deportation.Tuesday\u2019s delegation of Jewish students came to Congress to push the case that Khalil and others like him should never have been detained in their name. They met with at least 17 Democratic legislators from both the House of Representatives and the Senate.Al Jazeera spoke to several students who participated in the lobbying day, which was organised by Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) Action, an advocacy organisation. Here are some of their stories:Raised in upstate New York, history major Tali Beckwith-Cohen said she grew up in a community where Zionism was the norm. She remembers being told \u201cmyths\u201d about Palestine as \u201ca land without a people for a people without a land\u201d: a slogan used to justify the establishment of Israel.But as she began to learn Palestinian history and meet Palestinians, Beckwith-Cohen said her beliefs were challenged.Eventually, after the war in Gaza began in October 2023, she became involved in Palestinian rights activism.Human rights groups and United Nations experts have found evidence that Israel\u2019s tactics in Gaza are \u201cconsistent with genocide\u201d. More than 52,615 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict so far.\u201cFor a long time, I had this kind of feeling of discomfort, this feeling of wrestling, this feeling of maybe cognitive dissonance, and how can I reckon these values I hold dear with Zionism?\u201d Beckwith-Cohen told Al Jazeera.\u201cWe are seeing the bombing, the disregard for human life, for children, for hospitals, for schools. It forced me to make a choice.\u201dShe stressed that the protests were spaces of solidarity, where students of all backgrounds were committed to the idea that their safety is intertwined.\u201cThere\u2019s so much in the media narrative about what\u2019s happening on Columbia campus that is just disingenuous and just so untrue to what we\u2019ve experienced,\u201d  Beckwith-Cohen said.\u201cSo we\u2019re here today to tell our Congress people that what we\u2019re seeing on campus is clearly an authoritarian, fascist crackdown on all dissent, not only students peacefully advocating for an end to genocide.\u201dWhen Carly Shaffer voiced concern about the Israeli escalation in Gaza on a university WhatsApp chat, some of her fellow students questioned her Judaism.Out of the hundreds of people on the chat, she remembers that Khalil \u2013 the activist arrested for deportation \u2013 was the only person who contacted her directly to reject the comments she was subjected to.As she got to know Khalil, she came to view him as the \u201cembodiment\u201d of someone who cared about the safety of all students on campus.Shaffer told Al Jazeera that she felt \u201csick\u201d and \u201chorrified\u201d when Khalil was arrested. Her discomfort was then compounded when she saw that the Trump White House celebrated his detention on social media with the phrase \u201cShalom, Mahmoud\u201d \u2013 a Jewish greeting repurposed as a taunt.Shaffer, who is pursuing a master\u2019s degree in human rights and social policy, grew up in California and was raised by a single mother in a low-income household.She said speaking out against injustice \u2013 including in Palestine \u2013 is a practice rooted in her Jewish faith.\u201cThe Columbia protest movement, it\u2019s a movement of love. It\u2019s a movement of solidarity,\u201d Shaffer said. \u201cAnd Jewish students are also integral and crucial to this movement.\u201dShe said that, when Jewish student protesters held religious events on campus, their peers from the encampment joined them and inquired about their traditions.\u201cThese are the same students who are being portrayed as anti-Semites, who are going out of their way to go and learn about Passover and celebrate a Jewish holiday with their Jewish friends,\u201d Shaffer told Al Jazeera.She decried the \u201cweaponisation of anti-Semitism\u201d, saying that the issue is being used to shut down conversations about Israeli atrocities in Gaza.\u201cJewish students are being used as pawns in Trump\u2019s political agenda,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the weaponisation of anti-Semitism to dismantle this movement is not just a threat to Jewish students; it\u2019s a threat to all of us. That\u2019s why it is so important for us as Jewish students to directly correct this false narrative.\u201dBarnard College student Sarah Borus, who was arrested during the crackdown on the Columbia encampment, said she grew up in an anti-Zionist family in a \u201cvery Zionist community\u201d.She felt it was important for Jewish students like herself to convey their experiences directly to the people in power in Washington, DC.\u201cWe\u2019re talking to members of Congress to tell them our stories that are left out of mainstream news,\u201d Borus told Al Jazeera.\u201cTrump\u2019s mission is not about protecting Jewish students. It is about using fears of anti-Semitism \u2013 because of the way that the Gaza solidarity encampment was portrayed last year \u2013 in order to target non-citizen student activists, in order to target academic freedom, free speech, and really put many, many people in danger.\u201dWhen asked how she feels about the potential backlash to her activism, Borus acknowledged that the current political climate left her fearful.\u201cI\u2019m scared, but in the grand scheme of things, I\u2019m proud of the choices I have made,\u201d she said. \u201cI would not make any different ones, and I am willing to take on the risks, if that\u2019s what must be done.\u201dShay Orentlicher has no regrets about participating in Columbia University\u2019s encampments, despite the administrative and political crackdowns.Orentlicher said Christian nationalists are trying to erase the perspective of pro-Palestine Jewish students and define Judaism in a way that fits their political purposes.But protesting against the killing of Palestinians, Orentlicher said, is an expression of both Jewish and humanist values. And Orentlicher believes that Columbia\u2019s demonstrations have helped raise awareness nationwide.\u201cDespite the oppression we have faced, despite the suffering, and despite the despair of worrying that we have not done enough to stop the genocide, to stand up for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, I think we have shifted the public discourse in a really important way,\u201d Orentlicher said.\u201cAnd we also have built a really beautiful community. And I don\u2019t regret what I did at all. I wouldn\u2019t change anything.\u201dRaphie, who chose to identify by his first name only, said he grew up \u201cvery Zionist\u201d. But as he learned more about the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, he felt he had been deceived.\u201cThe Jewish elementary school I went to, for instance, had a map of Israel, and it was like a diamond \u2013 no West Bank or Gaza on it,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen I saw the actual map with the occupied territories, I was like, \u2018Wait, I was lied to.\u2019 And that kind of made me go on this whole journey of exploring what Zionism is, what occupation is, what settler colonialism is.\u201dRaphie, who is studying maths, said the war on Gaza, the campus protests and the backlash the student protesters faced all made him feel a \u201cpersonal responsibility to fight for what is right\u201d.In his experience, the demonstrations were welcoming, not anti-Semitic. What was anti-Semitic, he said, was the fact that the university targeted Jewish student protesters for their political views.Several students, including Raphie, said Columbia refused to grant students associated with Jewish Voice for Peace the permission necessary to hold religious celebrations in public spaces. They described that rejection as a form of discrimination.The university did not respond to Al Jazeera\u2019s request for comment by the time of publication.Raphie also drew a distinction between feeling uncomfortable about ideas that challenge one\u2019s worldview and actually being unsafe.\u201cIt\u2019s normal in college to encounter new viewpoints, new perspectives. That\u2019s how I became more pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist,\u201d he said. \u201cI initially felt uncomfortable when I encountered anti-Zionist views, but then I grew to understand them. That\u2019s normal.\u201dRaphie stressed that the real suffering is happening in Gaza.\u201cThe students who are not safe right now, of course, are the students in Gaza. Every university in Gaza has been destroyed. They haven\u2019t had food for 60 days.\u201d"}

They just don\u2019t want to fight, and we will honour that, and we will stop the bombings,\u201d Trump told reporters in the White House on Tuesday during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.Trump claimed that the Iran-aligned Yemeni group \u201ccapitulated\u201d and has promised not to carry out attacks on shipping. It launched those attacks in October 2023 shortly after the war in Gaza started, saying the attacks were in support of Palestinians.\u201cI will accept their word, and we will be stopping the bombing of Houthis, effective immediately,\u201d the US president said.Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said the two sides have agreed to a ceasefire.\u201cFollowing recent discussions and contacts conducted by the Sultanate of Oman with the United States and the relevant authorities in Sana\u2019a, in the Republic of Yemen, with the aim of de-escalation, efforts have resulted in a ceasefire agreement between the two sides,\u201d he wrote in a post on X.\u201cIn the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping.\u201dMohammed Ali al-Houthi, a member of the Houthis\u2019 Supreme Political Council, wrote in a post on X that \u201cTrump\u2019s announcement of a halt to America\u2019s aggression against Yemen will be evaluated on the ground first.\u201d\u201cYemen operations were and still are a support for Gaza to stop the aggression and bring in aid,\u201d he added, suggesting that the group would not halt its attacks on Israel.Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera\u2019s Mike Hanna said that the US State Department clarified that the agreement did not relate to the conflict between Israel and the Houthis.\u201cIt was made very clear by the US State Department that the deal relates directly to Houthi operations in the coast of Yemen, specifically in regard to US shipping,\u201d he said.The ceasefire announcement comes hours after the Israeli military launched air strikes on the airport in Sanaa, inflicting devastating damage and rendering it inoperable.Dozens of Israeli warplanes also launched several waves of large-scale overnight strikes on Yemen\u2019s vital port of Hodeidah in what Israel said was a response after the Houthis hit the perimeter of Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion International Airport with a ballistic missile.The US military has been launching daily air strikes across Yemen for nearly two months, destroying infrastructure and killing dozens of people, including children and civilians.Al Jazeera\u2019s Ali Hashem said it was \u201cpossible\u201d that Iran helped to convince the Houthis to de-escalate their attacks.\u201cThe Omanis have also been the main mediators between the US and Iran, and now the Houthis and the Americans. There are indications that the nuclear talks are advancing, with a framework shaping over sanctions lifting in exchange for nuclear restrictions,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is possible that the Iranians have helped in convincing the Houthis to de-escalate, especially if we see this reflected on the Iranian-American talks.

In the north, nearly all of Gaza City is under similar orders, with only small pockets in the northwest still exempt. Entire areas east of the Shujayea neighbourhood and along the Israeli border have been declared a restricted zone.The animated map below shows how Israel\u2019s military has expanded its forced displacement orders since breaking the ceasefire on March 18.On Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Gaza\u2019s more than two million people \u201cwill be moved\u201d in a new ground offensive that will involve Israeli troops holding on to seized territory, establishing a \u201csustained presence\u201d in Gaza.This follows the unanimous approval by Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet to call up 60,000 reservists and place the Israeli military in control of delivering food and other essential supplies to Gaza\u2019s starving population.Reporting from Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, Al Jazeera correspondent Tareq Abu Azzoum said Palestinians view the Israeli ground offensive in Gaza and reoccupation of much of its territorial landscape as a form of collective punishment and an attempt to change the demographic and political map of Gaza.Many Palestinians understand that Israel is prioritising territorial control over any political solution, and many shared their fear and panic regarding the possibility of not being able to return to their homes.They also believe that Israel is trying not just to dismantle the military capabilities of Hamas, as the Israeli military spokesperson and Netanyahu have stated, but they are also trying to empty Gaza of its residents and to suffocate civilians.Israel will do this by using humanitarian language alongside military tactics, including an expanded ground offensive and tightening its grip on the flow of aid to Gaza.But there was a general and clear sentiment of defiance among many Palestinians. Social media is filled with messages of resilience and people saying they will not leave Gaza, whatever the cost.The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) says Gaza is facing \u201cextreme risk of famine\u201d with no food remaining in markets and aid distribution centres.Israeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem has accused Israel of \u201cusing starvation as a method of warfare\u201d in Gaza. Half of those being starved by Israel are children, the prominent rights group said.\u201c[On] the nutritional front, the population is facing once again an extreme risk of famine,\u201d the PRCS said in its latest situation update.\u201cThere is an inability to meet even the minimum daily needs of over a million displaced people,\u201d it said.The PRCS\u2019s food stocks allocated for displaced people are now \u201ccompletely depleted\u201d, with \u201climited quantities of legumes\u201d being \u201cdistributed to community kitchens to cover some of the basic needs of displaced individuals\u201d.Since Israel broke the nearly two-month-long ceasefire with Hamas on March 18, its military has killed at least 2,459 Palestinians in Gaza, bringing the total number of confirmed killed in the besieged Strip to 52,567."}

Because of severe malnutrition, she suffered from blood acidity, liver and kidney failure, and many other complications. Her hair and nails also fell out due to malnutrition.\u201dAccording to leaked plans, Israel\u2019s government reportedly wants to severely restrict the way food is distributed in Gaza and is proposing that United States companies take over distribution from the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies.Under the plan, Palestinian families would be allowed to take one food parcel a week in designated hubs in southern Gaza, and Israel would permit 60 trucks to enter the Gaza Strip every day \u2013 just one-tenth of what\u2019s needed, according to experts.Aid groups in the UN have rejected this plan, saying it\u2019s a pressure tactic to further reinforce control over life-saving supplies."}

They were exercising their right to protest and engage in political speech on public property.\u201dDespite dropping the charges and growing criticism of the case, Nessel on Monday defended her decision to pursue felony charges against the students, saying \u201ca reasonable jury would find the defendants guilty of the crimes alleged\u201d.However, Nessel added in a statement that she dropped the charges nearly a year later because she did not believe \u201cthese cases to be a prudent use of my department\u2019s resources\u201d.While hundreds of students were arrested during the wave of pro-Palestine campus encampments that swept the United States last year amid Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, most were immediately released.The case in Michigan gained national attention and became symbolic of the nationwide crackdown on pro-Palestine demonstrations, with Palestinian rights advocates arguing that the Nessel case was an attack on freedom of speech and assembly.Defence lawyers for the accused had filed motions for Nessel to recuse herself from the case, citing accusations of bias \u2013 assertions that the attorney general dismissed as \u201cbaseless and absurd\u201d.\u201cThese distractions and ongoing delays have created a circus-like atmosphere to these proceedings,\u201d the attorney general said in her statement.Khuja, the defence lawyer, said the team was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d of winning the case, either by judicial dismissal or not-guilty jury verdict, and criticised Nessel\u2019s characterisation of the pretrial proceedings as \u201ccircus-like\u201d as untrue.He said requesting Nessel\u2019s removal from the case was warranted, adding that the charges should have been brought by the county and not the state\u2019s attorney general, according to Michigan\u2019s prosecution procedures.To underscore the alleged bias, the defence lawyer also noted that weeks before filing the charges last year, Nessel had clashed with Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, \u201cthe only Palestinian in Congress\u201d, for defending the chant \u201cfrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\u201d, which has been used by student protesters.Soon after Nessel charged the students, Tlaib accused the attorney general of \u201cpossible biases\u201d within her agency, underscoring that other protest movements did not face a similar legal crackdown.The attorney general responded by accusing Tlaib of anti-Semitism, although the congresswoman made no mention of the attorney general\u2019s religion or Jewish identity.\u201cRashida should not use my religion to imply I cannot perform my job fairly as Attorney General. It\u2019s anti-Semitic and wrong,\u201d Nessel wrote in a social media post in September.The controversy stretched for weeks, with CNN and pro-Israel outlets echoing Nessel\u2019s anti-Semitism allegations against Tlaib without evidence.Khuja said the attorney general ultimately wanted to \u201cmake an example out of those protesting for Palestine\u201d.He added that the case was larger than the students and politicians involved.\u201cThe First Amendment applies to all speech, but it\u2019s been under attack in order to shield Israel from criticism lately,\u201d Khuja told Al Jazeera.\u201cAnd this case proved that those who believe in Palestinian rights, their views are just as legitimate as anybody else\u2019s, and the First Amendment protects those views and your right to express them.\u201d"}

The claim could not be independently verified.Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported that six Israeli strikes hit Hodeidah\u2019s port and blamed both Israel and the United States. Axios quoted a senior US official who said the air raids were coordinated between Israel and the US.A US defence source told Al Jazeera that \u201cUS forces did not participate in the Israeli strikes on Yemen today\u201d but did not deny nonlethal support may have been provided.The attack was carried out after a ballistic missile fired from Yemen on Sunday struck close to Ben Gurion International Airport outside Tel Aviv.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had pledged retaliation for the Houthi attack, the first known missile to avoid interception since the Yemeni group began targeting Israel in November 2023.Al Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem reported that about 30 Israeli warplanes took part in Monday\u2019s operation, which was overseen by Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz from a command centre in Tel Aviv.Hashem said the strikes mark a \u201cnew phase\u201d in Israeli attacks on Yemen.Since President Donald Trump returned to power in January, the US has embarked on a more aggressive assault on Yemen \u201cwhich is related directly to Israeli interests\u201d, Hashem added.This is not the first time Israel has bombed targets in Yemen. In December, air raids struck the Ras Isa oil terminal and other sites in Hodeidah province, killing at least nine people.While most Houthi-launched projectiles have been intercepted, Sunday\u2019s attack was the \u201cmost significant strike\u201d, Hashem said, since the group launched its campaign in November 2023, which it said is in response to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and to show solidarity with Palestinians. A drone had previously hit a building in Tel Aviv last year.Since November 2023, the Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, have launched more than 100 drone and missile attacks targeting vessels they said are linked to Israel in the Red Sea.Although the Houthis paused attacks during a frail ceasefire in Gaza this year, they resumed their operations after Israel cut off humanitarian aid to Gaza and resumed its offensive in March."}

You are allowed to disagree and protest,\u201d Kirk wrote on X on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ve allowed far too many people who hate America move here from abroad, but the right to speak freely is the birthright of all Americans.\u201dSteve Bannon, a former Trump adviser and influential right-wing media personality, backed the comments of Kirk and Greene, writing on the social media platform Gettr, \u201cFact check: True\u201d and \u201cAgreed\u201d in response to their statements, respectively.The proposed legislation was introduced by pro-Israel hawks in the US Congress, Republican Mike Lawler and Democrat Josh Gottheimer, in January, and has been co-sponsored by 22 other lawmakers from both major parties.The bill would expand a 2018 law that bans coercive boycotts imposed by foreign governments to include international governmental organisations (IGOs).The original legislation prohibits boycotting a country friendly to the US based on an \u201cagreement with, a requirement of, or a request from or on behalf\u201d of another nation. It imposes penalties of up to $1m and 20 years in prison for violations.Expanding the legislation to include IGOs risks penalising individuals and companies in the US that boycott firms listed by the United Nations as doing business in illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.While the bill itself does not explicitly mention Israel, its drafters have said that it targets the UN and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement, which calls for economic pressure on the Israeli government to end its abuses against Palestinians.\u201cThis change targets harmful and inherently anti-Semitic BDS efforts at IGOs, such as the UN, by extending protections already in place for boycotts instigated by foreign countries,\u201d Lawler\u2019s office said in January.States and the federal government have been passing anti-BDS laws for years, raising the alarm about the violation of free speech rights, which are guaranteed by the First Amendment of the US Constitution.Numerous legal cases have challenged these laws, and some judges have ruled that they are unconstitutional, while others have upheld them.Rights groups and Palestinian rights advocates have argued that anti-boycott laws aim to shut down the debate about Israel and criminalise peaceful resistance against its violations of international law.Over the years, leading UN agencies and rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have accused Israel of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including imposing apartheid on Palestinians.But supporters of anti-BDS laws say the measures are designed to combat discrimination against Israel and regulate trade, not speech.Such laws have mainly faced opposition from progressive Democrats, but the IGO Anti-Boycott Act has generated anger from right-wing politicians, too.\u201cAmericans have the right to boycott, and penalizing this risks free speech. I reject and vehemently condemn antisemitism but I cannot violate the first amendment,\u201d Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, wrote on X.I agree with @RepMTG .\nI\u2019ll be voting No on this bill as well. https://t.co/YOPga59Xyc\u2014 Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) May 4, 2025The right-wing rejection of the Lawler-Gottheimer bill comes as the Trump administration continues with its push to target criticism of and protests against Israel, especially on college campuses.Since Trump took office, the US government has revoked the visas of hundreds of students for activism against Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.Several students, including legal permanent residents, have been jailed over allegations of anti-Semitism and \u201cspreading Hamas propaganda\u201d.Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University, has been detained since March, and the only known allegation against her is co-authoring an op-ed calling on her college to honour the student senate\u2019s call for divesting from Israeli companies.Trump has also frozen and threatened to freeze federal funding for several universities, including Harvard, over pro-Palestine protests."}

Senior Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi told Al Jazeera the group would only accept a deal with Israel that includes a comprehensive ceasefire and the complete withdrawal from Gaza.\u201cOur people have no choice but to achieve a comprehensive deal that guarantees security and safety for our people,\u201d he said, adding that any Israeli efforts to achieve concessions through threats or mass killings would fail.A United Nations spokesman said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was \u201calarmed\u201d by the Israeli plan that \u201cwill inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza\u201d.\u201cGaza is, and must remain, an integral part of a future Palestinian state,\u201d said spokesman Farhan Haq.The plans have stirred significant tension inside Israel as well.While Netanyahu again asserted that the goal was to \u201cdefeat\u201d Hamas and bring back several dozen captives held in Gaza, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an Israeli campaign group, said in a statement on Monday that the plan is \u201csacrificing\u201d those still held in the Palestinian territory.Heated disagreements also reportedly erupted during the cabinet meeting between the political and military figures.Army chief Eyal Zamir reportedly warned that Israel could \u201close\u201d the captives in Gaza if it pushed ahead with a full-blown military offensive.Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said that, as Israel has done in the past two months, it should continue to block all food, water, medicine, fuel and other aid from entering Gaza to starve the population.He also advocated for \u201cbombing food warehouses and generators\u201d so there are no more supplies and electricity is fully cut off.But Zamir warned this would \u201cendanger\u201d Israel as it would expose the country to even more allegations of violations of international law.\u201cYou don\u2019t understand what you are saying. You are endangering us all. There is an international law, we are committed to it. We cannot starve the Strip, your statements are dangerous,\u201d Zamir said, according to Israel\u2019s national broadcaster, Kan.In an interview with Israeli Army Radio, opposition leader Yair Lapid questioned Netanyahu\u2019s decision to mobilise tens of thousands of reservists, saying the prime minister was calling up troops and extending their service without setting a goal for the operation.Another opposition figure, Yair Golan, said Netanyahu was only trying to save his government from collapsing as the plan \u201cserves no security purpose and does not bring the release of the hostages closer\u201d.Ben-Gvir was reportedly the only member of the Security Cabinet who opposed the plan for Israel to bypass existing aid routes by international organisations.Israel, which has blocked the entrance of all supplies into Gaza since March 2, reportedly plans to use US security contractors to control the flow of aid into Gaza.However, the plan is not expected to come into effect immediately, as Israeli officials believe there is enough food in Gaza for now, even as Palestinians are starving to death.The Israeli plans also envisage the establishment of a new \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d in southern Gaza that would work as a base for aid.The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), a forum that includes United Nations agencies, said on Sunday that Israeli officials were seeking its consent to deliver aid through what it described as \u201cIsraeli hubs under conditions set by the Israeli military, once the government agrees to re-open crossings\u201d.In a statement, the HCT said such a plan would be dangerous and would \u201ccontravene fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic \u2013 as part of a military strategy\u201d.The coalition said the UN would not participate in this scheme as it does not adhere to the global humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality.Jan Egeland, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, told Al Jazeera the Israeli government wanted to \u201cmilitarise, manipulate, politicise the aid by allowing only aid to a few concentration hubs in the south, a scheme where people will be screened where it\u2019s a completely inoperable system\u201d.\u201cThat would force people to move to get aid, and it would continue the starvation of the civilian population,\u201d he added.On Monday, Hamas branded Israel\u2019s plans to take over aid provision \u201cpolitical blackmail\u201d.\u201cWe reject the use of aid as a tool of political blackmail and support the UN\u2019s stance against any arrangements that violate humanitarian principles,\u201d the armed group said in a statement, insisting that Israel is \u201cfully responsible\u201d for the \u201chumanitarian catastrophe\u201d in Gaza."}

The ship had been seeking to deliver aid including food and medicines to the besieged enclave, where aid groups warn people are struggling to survive following a two-month total blockade by Israel.Swedish activist Greta Thunberg said she was in Malta and had been planning to board the ship as part of the flotilla.Prime Minister Robert Abela said on Sunday that Malta was prepared to assist the ship with necessary repairs so that it could continue on its journey, once it was satisfied that the vessel held only humanitarian aid.Coalition officials said on Sunday that the ship was in no danger of sinking, but that they wanted to be sure it would be safe from further attacks while undergoing repairs, and able to sail out again.Earlier on Sunday, the coalition had accused Malta of impeding access to its ship. Malta denied the claim, saying the crew had refused assistance and even refused to allow a surveyor on board to assess the damage.\u201cThe FFC would like to clarify our commitment to engagement with [Maltese] authorities to expedite the temporary docking of our ship for repairs and surveyors, so we can continue on the urgent humanitarian mission to Gaza,\u201d the coalition said in a statement later in the day.A Malta government spokesman said its offer was to assist in repairs out at sea once the boat\u2019s cargo was verified to be aid.Coalition officials said the surveyor was welcome to board as part of a deal being negotiated with Malta.Israel halted humanitarian aid to Gaza two months ago, shortly before it broke a ceasefire and restarted its war against Hamas, which has devastated the Palestinian enclave and killed more than 51,000 people.Another NGO ship on a similar mission to Gaza in 2010 was stopped and boarded by Israeli troops, and nine activists were killed. Other such ships have similarly been stopped and boarded, with activists arrested.Hamas issued a statement about the incident off Malta, accusing Israel of \u201cpiracy\u201d and \u201cstate terrorism\u201d."}

Israel ending the fragile ceasefire, which saw Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Israeli captives, on March 18 has not led to any more releases.The reserve call-ups are going out as Netanyahu promised to respond to Yemen\u2019s Houthis after the rebels fired a missile that struck a road at Israel\u2019s Ben Gurion International Airport, wounding six people and prompting several major airlines to suspend flights.Netanyahu said the response will take place \u201cat a time and place of our choosing\u201d.The Houthis have said their fighters carried out the assault \u201cin support of the oppressed Palestinian people\u201d and to counter Israel\u2019s \u201ccrime of genocide\u201d in Gaza."}

A lack of Israeli police action has further emboldened settlers, who cite the Torah in claiming rights over Palestinian lands.Issa Amro, who was featured in The Settlers documentary made by British-American journalist and broadcaster Louis Theroux, released footage online showing how armed soldiers and settlers raided his house in Hebron in the occupied West Bank.Amro said police also threatened him with arrest and told him not to file a complaint in what he said is another instance of apartheid imposed by Israel in the West Bank. Rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have accused Israel of practising apartheid in occupied territory.Amro added on Sunday that the Israeli settlers who attacked him a day earlier told him United States President Donald Trump backed them. The settlers felt \u201cemboldened because of the Trump administration\u2019s blind support\u201d, the activist said.Theroux said he and his team have remained in regular contact with Amro.. @Issaamro who featured in The Settlers has posted videos of his latest harassment by settlers and soldiers. Our team has been in regular contact with him since the documentary and over the last 24 hours. We are continuing to monitor the situation. https://t.co/asEWKkVX5h\u2014 Louis Theroux (@louistheroux) May 4, 2025The BBC documentary, a follow-up to Theroux\u2019s 2012 film The Ultra Zionists, reflects on how the situation has evolved in occupied Palestinian territory.While conducting interviews with Palestinian and Israeli figures, the documentary explored how the settler population has grown significantly and how new military outposts and Israeli infrastructure have expanded across Palestinian territories, often with direct state support.It delves into the religious and ideological motivations behind the Israeli expansion, which has led to mass displacement of Palestinians and violent clashes, and it questions the legality and morality of the occupation as courts rule that it undermines international laws and norms.\u201cYou bring Jewish families [to the occupied West Bank], you live Jewish life, and this will bring light instead of darkness. And this is how the state of Israel was established, and this is what we want to do in Gaza,\u201d Daniella Weiss, a key member of the Israeli settler movement for decades, says in the documentary.Weiss, who has enjoyed support from a number of Israeli rabbis as well, said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is \u201chappy\u201d about the settler expansion. Netanyahu has opposed the Palestinian sovereignty over Gaza and occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.Settlers are Israeli citizens who live on private Palestinian land in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. They now number more than 700,000. All Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law.Settlements and their expansions are seen as the biggest hurdle in the realisation of a sovereign and independent Palestinian state living side by side with Israel.The United Nations General Assembly last year called on Israel to end its occupation of Palestinian territory. This came months after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that the Israeli presence in Palestinian territory is \u2018\u201dunlawful\u201d.Theroux himself was harassed as well when making part of the documentary in Hebron when Israeli soldiers approached him and tried to make him leave the area.The harassment of Amro comes shortly after Hamdan Ballal, the Palestinian co-director of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, was attacked by Israeli settlers in his home in the West Bank village of Susya.Armed and masked settlers vandalised his home and vehicle in late March and injured Ballal. While receiving treatment in an ambulance, Israeli soldiers blindfolded and arrested the filmmaker, who was later released without charge.Like the harassment of Amro on Saturday, that attack was also seen as retaliation for the documentary\u2019s international acclaim and its efforts to show the struggles of Palestinians in the West Bank.The incidents have also further highlighted the dangers faced by journalists and filmmakers under Israeli occupation at a time when Israel has killed more than 200 media workers in the Gaza Strip."}

Eight people were injured, according to paramedics.Israeli media reported that the advanced US-made THAAD system and Israel\u2019s long-range Arrow defence system failed to bring down the missile.Writing on social media, Netanyahu said that attacks from the Houthis ultimately \u201cemanate from Iran\u201d.\u201cIsrael will respond to the Houthi attack against our main airport AND, at a time and place of our choosing, to their Iranian terror masters,\u201d Netanyahu wrote.The Israeli prime minister has been trying to drum up support for a joint attack with the United States against Iran, despite ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran.Responding to Israel\u2019s threats, Iran\u2019s Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh said that Tehran would strike back if the US or Israel attacked.\u201cIf this war is intiated by the US or the Zionist regime [Israel], Iran will target their interests, bases and forces \u2013 wherever they may be and whenever deemed necessary,\u201d Nasirzadeh told Iranian state television.Nasirzadeh also said that Yemen\u2019s Houthis made their own decisions when conducting attacks.The rebel group, which has been carrying out attacks against Israel in stated opposition to its war and blockade on the Gaza Strip, claimed responsibility for the missile launched at Israel\u2019s busiest airport. More than 18 months of Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed at least  52,495 people, including 57 who starved to death due to the total Israeli siege since March 2, according to Palestinian officials.In a televised statement, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree warned airlines that Ben Gurion airport was \u201cno longer safe for air travel\u201d.The attack led to a brief suspension of flights at the airport in central Israel with some having to be redirected. All entrances to the airport were also briefly closed while train journeys towards the site were halted.A number of major airlines, including German carrier Lufthansa, Spanish airline Air Europa, Air France, SWISS, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Air India and Hungary\u2019s Wizz Air announced they were cancelling flights for Sunday, with some cancelling flights on Monday and Tuesday as well.The Houthis called on airlines flying to Israel to \u201ctake into consideration\u201d that it would \u201cimpose a comprehensive air blockade on [Israel] by repeatedly targeting\u2026 Ben-Gurion Airport\u201d.Sirens blared across central Israel, prompting many to move into shelters, according to Israeli media.Videos of the site of the impact circulating online showed the missile hit a connecting road inside the perimeter of the airport with some debris scattered on adjacent roads.Before his social media post, Netanyahu had promised to retaliate against the Houthis and continue the war on Gaza.In a video message in Hebrew, he said Israel and the US will \u201cact against them again in the future\u201d and do so using more than one blow. He also vowed \u201cthere will be no Hamas\u201d in Gaza.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened severe retaliation, too. \u201cWhoever attacks us, we will hit back sevenfold,\u201d Katz said in an apparent reference in the Torah relating to severe punishment, or divine justice.Benny Gantz, leader of the Israel Resilience party and a former war cabinet member, said the blame for the missile attack by the Iran-aligned group should be put on Tehran.\u201cIt is Iran that is firing ballistic missiles at the state of Israel, and it must bear responsibility,\u201d he said in a social media post without providing evidence. \u201cThe shooting at the state of Israel is bound to lead to a severe reaction in Tehran.\u201dYair Golan, a leading opposition figure, said millions of Israelis are in shelters again, Israeli captives held in Gaza are dying, the cost of living is crushing families and reservists are \u201ccollapsing under the burden\u201d of the war, which was launched after an attack headed by the Palestinian armed group Hamas in Israel on October 7, 2023, led to the killing of an estimated 1,139 people, with more than 200 taken captive.\u201cThis is big for Netanyahu, this is big for the government,\u201d Golan said about the prime minister. \u201cWe must return the kidnapped people home and end the war.\u201dHouthi attacks are continuing despite near daily bombardment of areas across Yemen by the United States military. Houthi-run media reported many more US air raids on Yemen early on Sunday, as well as after the attack on Ben Gurion airport.After the missile hit the airport, Al Masirah TV reported US air raids on the Khab and ash-Shaaf district of al-Jawf governorate.At dawn, US warplanes launched 10 raids on the al-Hazm district of the al-Jawf governorate and three attacks on the Marib governorate. More attacks hit Saada\u2019s Takhya region as well.It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties as with some of the other US strikes this week, including one on a migrant detention centre that killed dozens of people."}

Ending the fleeting ceasefire, which saw Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Israeli captives earlier this year, has not led to any more releases.A video circulated by Hamas on Saturday purported to show one of the Israeli captives, whom local media identified as Maxim Herkin. In the four-minute video posted online, Herkin is seen being rescued by Hamas members after an Israeli attack struck a tunnel, burying and injuring the Israeli captive.Families of the captives released a statement saying they spent the Sabbath gripped by \u201cexcruciating anxiety\u201d after news of the government\u2019s planned escalation and the effect it could have on those still held in Gaza.The Bring Them Home Campaign, a group representing the relatives, condemned the move as reckless.\u201cIsrael is on its way to sinking into the Gaza mud in the name of the illusion that it is possible to achieve any victory without returning our brothers and sisters from captivity,\u201d the group said in a post on X. \u201cExpanding the fighting will endanger the kidnapped, the living and the dead alike.\u201dThey urged Netanyahu to abandon the offensive and instead reach an agreement that would secure the captives\u2019 return. \u201cStop this mistake,\u201d the group said.Speaking to Al Jazeera, Israeli journalist Gideon Levy said the protest movement remains consistent, but lacks the momentum to challenge Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. \u201cIt\u2019s the same old protest, very courageous and devoted, but not big enough to influence Netanyahu,\u201d Levy said.He noted that a large segment of Israeli society continues to support the war effort, even amid rising frustration from the captives\u2019 families, and that \u201cwhen [Israelis] are called to war, they will obey.\u201dNetanyahu, speaking Thursday at a public event in Jerusalem, seemed to suggest that defeating Hamas remains Israel\u2019s top priority instead of the release of captives. \u201cWe want to bring all our hostages home,\u201d he said. \u201cThe war has a supreme goal, and the supreme goal is victory over our enemies, and this we will achieve.\u201dCaptives\u2019 families have accused Netanyahu of undermining previous attempts to reach a truce and swap deal. Some believe his refusal to compromise reflects political motives, aimed at ensuring the survival of his far-right coalition government, rather than genuine concern for the captives."}

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed responsibility for the attack, calling it a response to Israeli operations in Gaza.The Houthis have increasingly targeted Israel and shipping routes in the Red Sea, stating that their actions are acts of solidarity with Palestinians as Israel continues its assault on Gaza and the occupied West Bank.The Houthis did not carry out attacks during the Gaza ceasefire earlier this year until Israel blocked all aid into the besieged enclave in early March and followed that with a full resumption of the war.In the meantime, Houthi-affiliated Al Masirah TV reported on Saturday that the US launched two air raids on Yemen\u2019s Kamaran Island and as-Salif district in the port city of Hodeidah.The new attacks come a day after the same news outlet reported seven US attacks on the Ras Isa oil port in as-Salif district in Hodeidah. Last month, a US strike on the same port killed at least 80 people and wounded 150 in one of the deadliest attacks on the country by US forces.The US has also ramped up its air campaign in Yemen, launching its most extensive military operations in the Middle East since President Donald Trump assumed office in January.US forces claim to have struck Houthi positions, however, there have been numerous civilian casualties.The high civilian toll from US strikes is drawing increasing alarm. The UK-based monitor Airwars reported that between 27 and 55 civilians were killed in March alone. April\u2019s deaths are expected to be higher.Houthi sources say at least 68 African migrants died in a single overnight strike on Monday, with additional casualties reported around the capital.As the conflict intensifies, political instability is growing within Yemen.Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak, the prime minister of the internationally recognised government, announced his resignation on Saturday, citing persistent challenges, including his inability to reshuffle the cabinet.Government insiders said a power struggle with Presidential Council leader Rashad al-Alimi triggered Mubarak\u2019s departure.Within hours of the announcement, the presidential council named Finance Minister Salem Saleh bin Braik as prime minister, according to the state-run SABA news agency. The council also named bin Mubarak as an adviser to the ruling body, without addressing his claims.Mubarak\u2019s political career has been closely linked to the long-running war in Yemen. He rose to prominence after being abducted by Houthi fighters in 2015 while serving as chief of staff to then-president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.Much of the international community does not recognise the Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah (supporters of God), even though the armed Iran-aligned group controls most parts of Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa, and some of the western and northern areas close to Saudi Arabia."}

More than 9,000 children have been admitted to hospital for treatment for acute malnutrition since the start of the year, according to the United Nations.Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera\u2019s Hani Mahmoud said he had witnessed heartbreaking scenes of children rifling through rubbish, \u201clooking for whatever is left of canned food products\u201d. The enclave, he added, had reached a \u201ccritical\u201d point with international organisations out of supplies and community kitchens unable to prepare meals for displaced people.\u201cFinding a single meal has become an impossible quest,\u201d Ahmad al-Najjar, a displaced Palestinian in Gaza City, told Al Jazeera. \u201cPeople here have witnessed one charity after another declaring they\u2019re out of supplies, that they\u2019re shutting down their operations because they\u2019re in no position to \u2026 offer the population the needed relief.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating and infuriating to have trucks piling up on the other side of the fence be denied entrance while the people, even children, are in dire conditions.\u201dSuhaib al-Hams, the director of the Kuwaiti Hospital in Rafah, said in a statement that medical services were experiencing \u201cacute shortages in more than 75 percent of essential medicines\u201d, with only around a week of supplies left.He warned that most of the enclave\u2019s medical services will stop without \u201cimmediate intervention\u201d to reopen borders and allow medical and humanitarian aid through. He added that patients, who are \u201cslowly dying every day without treatment\u201d, needed to be evacuated urgently.The continued blockade is the longest such closure the Gaza Strip has ever faced, and has come as Israeli forces continue bombarding the territory, killing at least 70 Palestinians and wounding 275 others over the two days spanning Thursday to Saturday morning, according to the Health Ministry.On Saturday, two women were killed in an Israeli air raid on a house in the town of al-Fakhari near Gaza\u2019s southern city of Khan Younis, according to reports from Al Jazeera Arabic.Separately, a fisherman was killed and another injured by an Israeli naval attack off the coast of Gaza City.Later in the day, two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli drone attack on southern Gaza\u2019s al-Mawasi area, once an Israeli-designated \u201csafe zone\u201d.Israel\u2019s war on Gaza has killed at least 52,495 people and wounded 118,366 since October 7, 2023, according to the Health Ministry.

Orthopaedic surgeon Anas Hijjawi described a long line of doctors who had signed up for medical missions to Gaza, some of whom had to wait up to five months for a spot on a mission to open up.Dr Diyaa Rachdan, an ophthalmic surgeon, struggles to keep his voice steady as he tells Al Jazeera that Tuesday was the last day of the mission and the doctors would be heading back to their respective hospitals the next day.\u201cBut I am hoping that there will be more, longer trips to Gaza in the future,\u201d he adds.Their work in Gaza is not easy, but that is not the reason these doctors are sad to be leaving their mission behind. On the contrary, every day is a struggle as they try to cope with a volume of deaths, illnesses and injuries they simply do not have the equipment to address.Israel has often prevented the entry of hospital supplies into Gaza during the course of its nearly 19-month-long war on the besieged enclave. Medical missions are not allowed to bring anything in with them.So, the doctors struggle on with the equipment they can find, sometimes reusing \u201cdisposable\u201d medical implements over and over, despite the danger that poses, because there is simply no other choice, Dr Rachdan says.At the back of their minds, several doctors tell Al Jazeera, is always the thought that people in Gaza die of wounds and illnesses that would be easily treated in any other hospital that has adequate supplies.\u201cSometimes we can\u2019t cover a patient or take precautions to preserve the sterility of an operating room,\u201d Dr Hijjawi says.\u201cSometimes I don\u2019t have the right size metal plates or screws that I need to mend a limb. I\u2019ve had to use the wrong size item \u2026 just to get them better enough that they could, some day, travel for more treatment.\u201dWhile doctors coming into Gaza have often followed developments there closely before arrival, nothing, they tell Al Jazeera, could have prepared them for the level of destruction the people of Gaza have to cope with.\u201cWords can\u2019t describe the pain people are in here, or the level of exhaustion of the medical teams. They\u2019ve been working nearly around the clock for a year and a half now, despite their own personal pain and tragedies,\u201d says the fourth Qatar-based volunteer, urology consultant Mohammad Almanaseer.There\u2019s a tentativeness in Dr Almanaseer\u2019s voice as he speaks of the case that has impacted him the most deeply, the story of a little boy of about two years old who was brought into the emergency room after Israel had bombed him and his family.\u201cThe usual resuscitation attempts were made with him, but he needed immediate surgery. I was in the operating room, assisting the paediatric surgeon, but it became clear to us that the child probably wouldn\u2019t survive.\u201dThe child died the next morning.\u201cHe was the same age as my son, and even had the same name. Kinan, little Kinan, may God receive you and your mother, who was killed in the same bombing, by his side.\u201dInjuries as extreme and urgent as Kinan\u2019s are what the medical teams deal with day in and day out, resulting in a large swath of patients who need less urgent care and who keep getting pushed down the list.Like the patients who have been waiting for months or years for cataract surgery, some of whom were helped by Dr Rachdan during this mission.The people of Gaza have been forced to carry on throughout the genocidal war on their existence. This strength has inspired a sort of bewildered regard among the visiting volunteer doctors.Dr Hijjawi tells of an afternoon chat with an operating room nurse who was explaining how he struggles to get to work every day and how he says a final farewell to his wife and children every day, because he never knows what may happen to any of them.\u201cThen, we heard ambulances coming in,\u201d Dr Hijjawi continues, \u201cand we went to muster in the emergency room. Suddenly, the OR nurse came running past us, desperately asking for an ambulance to go to his house with him because he had heard it had been bombed.\u201cIt took some time \u2026 but they finally went out and came back with his parents, who had been killed, and the rest of his family, who had injuries among them. And, you know what? Just two days after this happened to him, he\u2019s here, he\u2019s upstairs working.\u201dAll four doctors seem to have a soft spot for their paediatric patients. It is the children\u2019s pain that affects them the most, and it is their suffering that they will take away with them in their memories.Al Jazeera follows Dr Almanaseer on his rounds as he visits a young girl in intensive care. She is recovering from severe burns on much of her face and body. In quiet tones, she asks him about whether she will be left with big scars from the burns.The doctor answers her quietly and seriously, taking time to talk to her until it seems like she\u2019s reassured for today.Dr Hijjawi is also on his rounds, speaking to a little girl, gently examining her leg and asking her to \u201clift both feet off the bed for me\u201d. Then he asks a little boy to wiggle his toes so he can check on how he\u2019s healing.Next is a young girl lying under a recovery blanket in a room on her own. Her right arm is bandaged, which is what he\u2019s there to look at.He squats on the floor near her bed and moves her arm, then each of her fingers. He\u2019s concerned because she seems to have lost sensation in two fingers and feels the problem will have to be explored surgically, as he tells a concerned relative.The children are quiet, wide-eyed, doing as they\u2019re told and not saying much else.\u201cThere\u2019s so much they\u2019re dealing with,\u2019 Hijjawi says. \u201cBeing in the hospital is scary, but on top of that, so many of them are just lying there waiting, hoping, for someone to visit them \u2013 a parent or grandparent or sibling. Some of them don\u2019t know who\u2019s left alive from their family outside the hospital walls.\u201cAdd all that to their physical pain, yes, they are very quiet for very long periods, or their minds seem to wander,\u201d he says quietly.Dr Rachdan is holding fast to one memory of Gaza\u2019s children that he seems to want to preserve as he gets ready to leave: \u201cOne thing that I don\u2019t think I will ever forget is the sight of the children in Gaza who continue playing, despite the destruction.\u201cThey make paper aeroplanes, play ball, despite the tragedy they are surrounded by. I will always remember that.\u201d"}

But it has not led to any more releases since the fleeting ceasefire earlier this year, which saw Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Israeli captives.Meanwhile, Hamas official Abdel Rahman Shadid on Friday accused Israel of using starvation as a \u201cdeliberate weapon of war\u201d against Palestinians.\u201cChildren are dying from the lack of milk, not just from bombs,\u201d Shadid said in a statement published on the group\u2019s Telegram channel.Legal experts and human rights groups have noted that, as an occupying power, Israel has an obligation under international law to provide food and other assistance to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.They have condemned the blockade as a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians of all ages are experiencing high levels of food insecurity in Gaza, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system, a global hunger watchdog.Amjad Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, told Al Jazeera that the situation is worsening quickly as health facilities lack the supplies needed to treat children grappling with malnutrition.\u201cWe have no food supplies or supplementary materials or medications for these children,\u201d Shawa told Al Jazeera from Gaza City. \u201cThere is high concern that we will witness more casualties in the coming few days,\u201d he added.At Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, Dr Ahmed Abu Nasir said the situation has become worse than ever due to the blockade.\u201cChildren are in their growing stage and badly need certain nutrients, including proteins and fats,\u201d the paediatrician told Al Jazeera. \u201cThese are not available in the Gaza Strip, particularly in the north.\u201dMore than 52,400 Palestinians have been killed since Israel\u2019s war on Gaza began in October 2023, according to figures from the Gaza Health Ministry."}

Alfayoumi, meanwhile, was stabbed 26 times. He did not survive.Czuba\u2019s trial featured audio from Shaheen\u2019s panicked 911 call, as well as testimony from the mother herself. Speaking from the witness stand in English and Arabic, she described Czuba becoming increasingly paranoid and Islamophobic as the war progressed.For nearly two years before the attack, the family had rented a pair of bedrooms in Czuba\u2019s house in Plainville, Illinois, just outside of Chicago.But after the war began on October 7, Shaheen recalled Czuba telling her to move out of her lodgings because Muslims were not welcome.Then, during the attack, she once again heard him citing her Muslim faith. \u201cHe told me \u2018You, as a Muslim, must die,\u2019\u201d said Shaheen.The incident was one of the highest-profile acts of anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab and anti-Muslim violence in the US after the war in Gaza broke out.But advocates say it is part of a trend of anti-Palestinian and Islamophobic hate that has swept the country in recent months.After the attack, police found Czuba sitting on the ground outside of the home, his hands and body bloody. Czuba pleaded not guilty, and his defence team has sought to vacate his conviction on the grounds that the prosecution played to the jury\u2019s emotions.Some of the images of the crime scene were so graphic that the judge ordered the court\u2019s television screens to be turned away from the audience. Jury members heard Shaheen telling 911 operators in fear, \u201cThe landlord is killing me and my baby!\u201dDuring his opening statements, Michael Fitzgerald, the assistant state\u2019s attorney for Will County, described Alfayoumi\u2019s final moments as full of horror.\u201cHe could not escape,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t enough that this defendant killed that little boy, he left the knife in the little boy\u2019s body.\u201dIn February, the jury took less than 90 minutes to return a guilty verdict.On Friday, Judge Bertani-Tomczak rejected the defence\u2019s bid to overturn the conviction. In announcing the sentence, she called Czuba\u2019s actions \u201cbrutal\u201d and \u201cheinous\u201d.She said a 30-year prison sentence was given for Alfayoumi\u2019s murder, plus another 20 years for the attack on his mother and three years for committing a hate crime.Alfayoumi\u2019s great-uncle, Mahmoud Yousef, was the only family member to speak at the sentencing hearing. He said no amount of prison time could ever make up for the loss his family has suffered.He also explained that Alfayoumi had seen Czuba as a grandfather figure, and he questioned what \u201cfake news\u201d about the war in Gaza could have prompted such violence.\u201cSome people are bringing this war to this country,\u201d Yousef said. \u201cWe cannot do that. We can\u2019t bring the war here. We cannot bring hatred to this country.\u201dThe American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) also responded to the sentencing by calling on Americans to reject hate and prejudice.\u201cThis sentencing brings closure to the case, and a measure of accountability and justice to a tragedy that has shaken our community,\u201d the group\u2019s executive director Abed Ayoub said in a statement. \u201cWe must come together to ensure that tragedies fueled by anti-Arab, anti-Palestinian hate, and Islamophobia are never accepted as the norm in our society.\u201dIn March, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) issued a report saying it had received 8,658 complaints of anti-Muslim and anti-Arab incidents in the last year alone, a 7.6 percent rise.It was the highest tally the group had recorded since it began collecting data in 1996."}

But the question, now, is what are these states going to do about it?\u201d he told Al Jazeera.He noted the UK had used the recent hearings to denounce Israel\u2019s obstruction of aid and to speak about its decision to halt arms sales to Israel, not enough of an action, he added.France also spoke about the need for Israel to quickly facilitate aid into Gaza.But the statements appear to be attempts to substitute for Europe\u2019s collective failure to take urgent action against Israel for its conduct in Gaza, said Haque.\u201cThe onus is on states to decide what they are going to do about [Israel\u2019s actions] and not to wait for the court to rule on what they already know,\u201d Haque added.The ICJ is not expected to issue an advisory opinion for months.The non-binding advisory opinion will likely not compel Israel or member states to change course, according to legal scholars.Israel has ignored an earlier binding provisional measures by the ICJ ordering it to scale up humanitarian aid and end acts of genocide in Gaza as a result of a genocide case brought against Israel by South Africa in December 2023.No state has taken any action against Israel for failing to implement the provisional measures.McIntyre believes the court will eventually issue a narrow ruling that outlines Israel\u2019s responsibilities to facilitate aid and cooperate with UNRWA.By the time the court issues its opinion, tens of thousands of Palestinians may have already starved to death, or been ethnically cleansed by Israel.\u201cThe advisory opinion won\u2019t solve the problem on the ground and genuine action [by states] needs to be taken,\u201d warned McIntyre."}

The military added that the outcome of the second interception was still under review.Yahya Saree, spokesperson for the Houthis \u2013 also known as Ansar Allah \u2013 confirmed the group had carried a \u201cmilitary operation\u201d against a key Israeli military target.Saree said hypersonic missiles were used and had successfully hit their intended destination.The Israeli army responded that \u201cinterception attempts were made\u201d without providing further details.The Houthi group has repeatedly said its attacks on Israel as well as United States and British ships in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandeb Strait will only cease if Israel agrees to a permanent Gaza truce.The Houthis did not carry out attacks during the Gaza ceasefire earlier this year until Israel blocked all aid into the besieged enclave in early March and followed that with a full resumption of the war.The attacks come as the US escalates its military operations in Yemen.On Friday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth extended the USS Harry S Truman\u2019s deployment in the Middle East for an additional week, ensuring two carrier strike groups remain operational in the region, a Pentagon official confirmed anonymously to The Associated Press news agency.Since March, the US has launched large-scale attacks not only on infrastructure but increasingly on individuals linked to the Houthi leadership.Civilian casualties are mounting, with UK-based monitor Airwars estimating between 27 and 55 civilians were killed in March alone, and suggesting April\u2019s toll is even higher.On Monday, at least 68 people were killed in the overnight strike on detained African migrants, and eight people were killed around the capital, Houthi media reported.Rights advocates have been alarmed about the growing civilian death toll. Three US Democratic senators recently wrote to Hegseth, demanding an accounting of civilian lives lost.\u201cStrikes pose a growing risk to the civilian population in Yemen,\u201d United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Monday. \u201cWe continue to call on all parties to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians.\u201d"}

Reform hopes to ride growing support to unbalance the United Kingdom\u2019s political system, which is traditionally dominated by the governing Labour Party and opposition Conservatives.\u201cIt\u2019s been a huge night for Reform,\u201d said Reform leader Nigel Farage after the party was declared winner of the seat of Runcorn and Helsby.The victory in northwest England, previously a Labour stronghold, came by just six votes.Reform also prevailed in a mayoral race in Greater Lincolnshire and picked up dozens of council seats from Labour and the Conservatives in the first polls since general elections last year.The results appear to underline the fracturing of the UK\u2019s political landscape.Prime Minister Keir Starmer led Labour to one of the largest parliamentary majorities in British history in last year\u2019s election but has gone on to suffer the fastest decline in popularity of any newly elected government.Brexit champion Farage, a populist who has allied himself in the past with United States President Donald Trump, noted that the win in Runcorn and Helsby, which Labour won in last year\u2019s national election with a majority of almost 15,000 votes, showed that the ruling party\u2019s vote had \u201ccollapsed\u201d.Labour has lost support as the government has raised taxes, cut benefits for the elderly and proposed sweeping welfare reforms, alienating the left-wing party\u2019s traditional voter base and driving some into the arms of Reform.In Greater Lincolnshire, newly elected mayor Andrea Jenkyns, a former Conservative minister who defected to Reform after losing her seat last year, became the party\u2019s most powerful elected politician yet, with responsibility for an area covering about a million people.In her victory speech, Jenkyns pledged to bring an end to \u201csoft-touch Britain\u201d and said asylum seekers should be held in tents, not in hotels as they often are in the country.\u201cThe rebuilding begins here \u2026 we\u2019re going to have a Britain where we put British people first,\u201d she said.Reform UK is the latest in a series of parties led by Farage, a veteran hard-right politician who was crucial in taking the UK out of the European Union through a 2016 referendum. A divisive figure, he has said many migrants come to the UK from cultures \u201calien to ours\u201d.Reform, which has pledged to \u201cstop the boats\u201d of irregular migrants crossing the English Channel, is hoping that winning mayoralties and gaining councillors would help it build its grassroots activism before the next general election \u2013 likely in 2029.The party hopes to scoop up hundreds of municipal seats in the elections that are deciding 1,641 seats on 23 local councils and six mayoralties, as well as the parliamentary seat.Ballots in most of those contests are being counted on Friday and results should be announced in the afternoon."}

Medical sources told Al Jazeera that 22 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli air raids since dawn, with attacks on the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza and the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood in the northwest of Gaza City."}
