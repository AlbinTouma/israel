It cannot be done via kinetic means.\u201dWhat is possible, he says, is a solution such as played out in Libya, South Africa and elsewhere, where \u201cthe balance of pros and cons\u201d leads the leadership of a state to abandon its nuclear weapons efforts.\u201cOnly the Americans can bring that about,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly President Trump.

During the entire period since Trump returned to office, he says, \u201cthere has not been a day without high-level diplomatic discussions\u201d involving Prime Minister Netanyahu, Minister Ron Dermer and/or himself and the US leadership, including Trump and Vice President JD Vance.The talk of a crisis in the ties was \u201cinaccurate,\u201d he says. \u201cToday, too, they want a diplomatic agreement.\u201d But at a certain stage, \u201cthey understood, as we had understood earlier, that an agreement could not [yet] be attained\u201d with the Iranians.After referring to Iranian military commanders targeted in the strikes so far, Hanegbi stresses that Israel does not intend to target Iran\u2019s \u201cpolitical leadership\u201d in this campaign.Asked if Israel has ground forces inside Iran, he says guardedly, \u201cThere is fighting in Iran not only involving the Air Force and the Navy.\u201dHe says the campaign is at \u201cthe beginning of the beginning,\u201d that Israel\u2019s \u201cambitious goals\u201d will not be realized quickly, and expects that Iran will continue to retaliate.He says cabinet ministers, asked to approve the operation last night, and with time short, agreed not to make speeches. Netanyahu told them there were only a few minutes before the need to give the order to scramble the air force, Hanegbi says, and simply asked if anyone was opposed. \u201cNobody was opposed.\u201d"}

The US officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public.The forces in the region have been taking precautionary measures for days, including having military dependents voluntarily depart regional bases, in anticipation of the strikes and to protect those personnel in case of a large-scale response from Tehran.Typically around 30,000 troops are based in the Middle East, and about 40,000 troops are in the region now, according to a third US official. That number surged as high as 43,000 last October amid the ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran as well as continuous attacks on commercial and military ships in the Red Sea by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen.The Navy has additional assets that it could surge to the Middle East if needed, particularly its aircraft carriers and the warships that sail with them. The USS Carl Vinson is in the Arabian Sea \u2014 the only aircraft carrier in the region.The carrier USS Nimitz is in the Indo-Pacific and could be directed toward the Middle East if needed, and the USS George Washington just left its port in Japan and could be directed to the region if so ordered, one of the officials said.Then-president Joe Biden initially surged ships to protect Israel following the October 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas that launched the war in Gaza. It was seen as a deterrent against Hezbollah and Iran at the time.On October 1, 2024, US Navy destroyers fired about a dozen interceptors in defense of Israel as the country came under attack by more than 200 missiles fired by Iran."}

A fisherman sits in silence on the rocks behind a stage at Charles Clore park, which would have at that this hour boasted some of Israel\u2019s biggest stars.Several dozen people have taken advantage of the unexpected serenity to sunbathe, smoke and play soccer on the sand.Others flock to the few eateries and flower shops that decided to open for business. Most shops, especially clothing, jewelry and bookstores, appear shuttered.Supermarkets, however, were packed, as Israelis sought to store up on basic necessities in case of a long stint in safe rooms.The Carrefour supermarket chain opened at 6 a.m. today \u2014 an hour earlier than usual \u2014 and saw four times the number of usual customers, the retailer said, adding that it had called in extra staff and saw a spike in sales of bottled water and hygiene products.Meanwhile, commerce at the open-air Carmel market, near the Tel Aviv beach, falls far short of its usual traffic on a Friday, even without the Pride parade.\u201cThere are no people,\u201d says Victor, who owns a flower shop at the entrance to the open-air Carmel market, not far from the route of the parade.Because of the parade, he brought double the usual stock of flowers to sell, says Victor, chuckling at the irony.Victor has access to a safe room at his place of business. Asked if he had thought to stay closed today, he says: \u201cNot for a minute. I\u2019m self-employed, I have no choice.\u201dThe tense security situation does not appear to have sparked panic on the streets. Pedestrians can be seen walking slowly back from the beach, stopping for a cold drink and a bite to eat where possible. Some sit and chat on picnic tables outside shuttered kiosks.Racquel, a tourist from Chile who arrived in Yel Aviv yesterday after a few days in Jerusalem, seems unperturbed. \u201cWe knew we were coming to Israel and that there would be problems,\u201d she says."}

The State of Israel will not allow a regime whose objective is to destroy the State of Israel to obtain weapons of mass destruction,\u201d the IDF says.\u201cThe IDF has conducted a process of preparations for a campaign on the frontline and on the home front. The resilience of Israel\u2019s citizens will be an important factor of the campaign. The IDF is ready to continue to act as required. The State of Israel has the obligation to act in defense of its citizens and will continue to do so everywhere it is required to do so, as we have done in the past. The IDF is conducting an ongoing situational assessment and will update on any developments,\u201d it adds."}

We learn something new every day, and how it\u2019s being carried out. We\u2019re getting greater levels of security, pushing the food further inward to the people who are receiving it, so it\u2019s easier for them to get it. Hamas is doing everything it can to disrupt the flow of the food, and that\u2019s the piece of this that isn\u2019t getting reported.\u201dHe adds that the US is \u201cvery frustrated with the fact that the UN has been screaming to get humanitarian aid into Gaza, and then when we created an organization to do that very thing, they\u2019ve sat on their hands.\u201dHe calls the French-Saudi United Nations on Palestinian statehood next week \u201cridiculously ill-timed.\u201d\u201cThis was in the midst of a war, for heaven\u2019s sakes, that they, they\u2019re facing threats on all sides,\u201d he says of Israel. \u201cYou would think that if European countries have time and energy to put pressure on anyone, anything for any purpose, they would say, Hamas, we\u2019re putting all the pressure on you.\u201dHuckabee says that Washington would not interfere with a decision to annex parts of the West Bank.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to tell Israel what it should do and how it should create communities in Judea and Samaria,\u201d he says, using the Israeli name for the West Bank. \u201cWe have been very clear, and this goes back to the first Trump administration, that developing communities in Judea and Samaria is not a violation of international law.\u201dAsked about the International Criminal Court, Huckabee calls the Hague-based court \u201can incredibly lawless, worthless entity that is going after Israelis.\u201d"}

The anonymous contractor also says they didn\u2019t receive cultural awareness training, even though some had never been deployed to the Mideast before.While the American contractors were told they\u2019d be working 12-hour shifts for four days before taking two days off, they\u2019ve ended up working 20-hour shifts with no days off and are all sleep-deprived, he says.The contractor recalls the chaos of the first full day of aid distribution on May 27, when GHF\u2019s site was completely overrun.\u201cIt was not organized, and people were getting smushed and trampled. Eventually, there were so many people in the lanes that the gates burst,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey were only trying to get aid \u2014 aid, by the way, that consisted of flour, rice, lentils, tea bags, and noodles; things that need water. They don\u2019t have any water. And we\u2019re not giving out water.\u201dDespite assertions to the contrary by the IDF and GHF, the contractor says the Israeli army is very involved in the operation. The IDF has offices inside the GHF compounds and shares radio communications with GHF, he says.\u201cI went into this pretty open-minded. I don\u2019t have a side. I despise human suffering, and I hate that it exists. I was just hoping to be helpful. But I don\u2019t think we are. What we \u2014 these American companies and contract personnel \u2014 are doing is directly leading to more pain, suffering, and death for the Palestinians in Gaza,\u201d he writes."}
