It hit me like starlight\u2014it was sudden, timeless, boundless. I remember thinking to myself: So now I\u2019m reading with my whole soul.\nIt reminded me of an experience many years ago in the Himalayas. A group of us were trekking near Annapurna when we paused\u2014to catch our breath. No village in sight. No trail markers. Just endless sky.\u201d\nStars twinkled with such force, such brilliance, it felt as if you could step right into them.\nThat is what reading M\u00e1rquez felt like.\nNot escape, but entry. The back door you didn\u2019t see, suddenly opening. Into memory, into mystery, into magic. Into the hum of what it means to be human in all its ache.\nI\u2019ll never read the book for the very first time again. Its enchantment has in no way lessened, though. If anything, it has only remained even brighter.\nThese days, I read slowly. I pause frequently\u2014not because I\u2019ve lost track of the plot, but because it\u2019s well worth recalling again. Because existence, with all its pleasure and rough edges, has sharpened the words to be truer.\nWhen Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez sat down to write One Hundred Years of Solitude, he risked everything. He quit his job, sold his car, and pawned his wife Mercedes\u2019s mixer and hairdryer to carry on. He went into debt for the tale.\nAnd after presenting the first draft to her at long last, she said:\n\u201cThis had better be one good novel.\u201d\nIt was.\nNot even because of the magical prose. But because M\u00e1rquez wrote from experience lived to the fullest\u2014vivid, dangerous, passionate. You can\u2019t reproduce that. You can\u2019t research it or diagram it on an Excel spreadsheet. You live it. Then, if you\u2019re lucky, you find the words.\nI look back at it all a lot nowadays as I traverse the latter sections of my own life. These days, I\u2019m accumulating wisdom instead of possessions.\nAs much as I\u2019ve derived inspiration from M\u00e1rquez, my own wisdom didn\u2019t come from his words. It came from living with an open heart\u2014with my feet in the flames.\nHe once wrote:\n\u201cNobody will ever be able to take away the dances you have already enjoyed.\u201d\nThat resonates with me.\nLoss has happened to me\u2014not just people, but places, roles, dreams. Futures I thought would be mine. I had to let them go.\nThe dances, though. The laughter-filled meals. The late-night conversations. The early light, coffee. The quiet strength.\nNo one can take those from me.\nHe also said:\n\u201cIt is not the case that people cease to dream as one ages; it is the case that people age as dreaming is no longer pursued.\u201d\nLet that one sink in.\nWe\u2019re sold the idea that aging is a gradual fading. What if it\u2019s something else? What if it\u2019s the refining fire\u2014a crossing into something that shines more brightly? A quieter, longer-lasting kind of significance?\nA few more of M\u00e1rquez\u2019s truths now strike me as more relevant than ever:\nWisdom only comes to us after it is no longer useful to us.\nA minute in reconciliation is better than living the rest of one\u2019s life as friends.\n\u201cThe heart forgets the wrongdoing but retains the good.\u201d\n\u201cA real friend is one who takes your hand and reaches your heart.\u201d\nAnd always\u2014there is still something to be loved.\nThat one, in particular? It has helped me understand one of the most difficult truths in life.\nI never believed that love was some winnable goal or final destination. I loved by trusting\u2014people, the world, the moment. That trust brought heartbreak. It left me sometimes weary of trying again.\nBut now, I see love differently. I see it as practice. As an act. As a way of being in the world.\nWe love anyway.\nWe love again.\nWe love even when it\u2019s hard\u2014especially then.\nBut not when it dims our light. Not when it costs us our peace.\nWhether it\u2019s a person, a calling, a place, or a history\u2014there is always something to love.\nI will always remember one stop we made in a small village while trekking to Annapurna. In a quiet courtyard, a ten-year-old girl lay ill. A shaman was performing a healing ceremony, waving sage, smoke, and a live chicken over her.\nWe asked what was wrong. They told us she had something in her chest. My children\u2019s father, a doctor, examined her. We had antibiotics in our backpack. We gave some to her parents\u2014along with the name, dosage instructions, and information on where to get more.\nTen days later, on our way back through the village, we stopped again.\nShe was in the courtyard, playing with the other children.\nThat is love\u2014even between strangers in a remote Nepalese village.\nLove needs no shared language\u2014only the one we all speak as human beings.\nI have loved. I have lost. Raised children, raised questions. Let go, held on. Come to terms with some things, made stories out of the rest.\nI am no wiser than anyone else. But I\u2019ve learned to listen\u2014sometimes. To others, and to the stories inside me.\nWe should have written:\n\u201cFiction began the day Jonah returned from work three days late, telling his wife he\u2019d spent the time as a guest inside a whale.\u201d\nHe did get it. Stories don\u2019t just help us understand the world\u2014they help us survive in it. Sometimes, they even help us begin again.\nAnd if you\u2019re reading these words thinking your golden years are already behind you\u2014they\u2019re not. There is always something worth being passionate about, new opportunities to embrace, and a growth mindset to cultivate.\nAs for me, I have no plans to stop dancing anytime soon.\nOne Hundred Years of Solitude\u2014this is a novel every human should read at least once in a lifetime."}

This article will discuss the historical development and significance of this day as well as lessons for the future using classical sources from both the written and oral Torah.\nThe Mishna in Talmud Taanit 26b lists the following tragedies that occurred on this day:\nIn the year 2449 from creation, Hashem decreed that the generation that left Egypt would not enter the land of Israel (Numbers 13-14).\nThe Babylonians destroyed the first temple in 3339 (2 Kings Chapter 25).\nThe Romans destroyed the second temple in 3830 (Tradition).\nThe Romans conquered and destroyed the city of Betar in 3895 (Tradition).\nThe Roman commander Turnus Rufus plowed the Temple Mount in 3897 (Tradition).\nFor tragedies 3-5,  the Talmud cannot quote from scripture because Hebrew scripture ends at the beginning of the Second Temple based upon the Talmudic saying (Yoma 9b), \u201cAfter the last prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi died, the Divine Spirit of prophetic revelation departed from the Jewish people.\u201d However the sages of the Mishna and Talmud were divinely inspired, albeit not at a scriptural level, based upon this Talmudic saying (Bava Batra 12a), \u201cFrom the day that the Temple was destroyed prophecy was taken from the prophets and given to the Sages\u201d, meaning that the dates of these tragedies are authentic. In addition laws and practices instituted by these sages have divine approval.\n(Note: The years listed above follow the traditional chronology of Judaism starting from creation. However there is a 1 year difference in counting, between the dates of the Talmud (less by one year) and our current numbering of years.\nThe land of Israel and particularly Jerusalem are the common thread of these 5 tragic events. Although other tragedies occurred on Tisha B\u2019Av outside of Israel, the Mishna does not list them because they did not fit this divine decree.\nIn addition to discussing the different tragedies the articles will highlight the moral lessons to be learnt from the past and applied to the present.\nDue to the length of this topic the author has divided this article in the following times:\nBiblical.\nDestruction of Second Temple.\nFall of Betar (Bar Kochva Rebellion).\nModern Times and Conclusion.\nTragedy 1 \u2013  Decree Against Entering Israel\nIt is interesting to note that the Torah does not explicitly mention the 9th of Av as the day that Hashem issued the decree against entering the land of Israel. The Talmud (ibid. 29a) deduces this date from the following time sequence:\nEvent Start Date Duration (days) Verses in Numbers\nIsraelites travel Iyar 20 3 10:11-12  and 10:33\nComplaint for meat Iyar 23 29 11:4 \u2013 20\nMiriam quarantined Sivan 23 7 12:13\nSpies Sivan 29 40 13:25\n  (Note: The Torah counts the months starting from the Exodus. Hence Nissan, Iyar, and Sivan are months 1, 2 and 3 respectively).\nThe Torah clearly states, that on the 20th day of the second month of the second year from the Exodus, the cloud lifted from the Tabernacle and the Israelites started to journey towards Israel (ibid. 10:11-12). The Torah then relates that they journeyed for three days (ibid. 10:33). Then the Israelites demanded meat from Hashem (ibid. 11:4). Hashem agreed to their request and granted meat for 30 days (ibid.11:20). However since their request displayed a lack of faith, Hashem smote the Israelites with a mighty blow (ibid. 11:33). Following this tragedy, Miriam spoke improperly about Moses (ibid. 12:1-2), was stricken with a skin condition called tzaarat (ibid. 12:10), and was quarantined for 7 days (ibid. 13:25). In deference to Miriam, the Israelites did not travel for these days.\nOn the 29th of Sivan, Moses sent 12 spies to Israel to scout the land of Israel who returned after 40 days (Numbers 13:1-25). Allowing for 2 days in Sivan, 30 days in Tammuz (the 4th month), and 8 days in Av (2+30+8 =40), they returned to camp on the 8th of Av and related their fearful message to the people (ibid. 13:32-14:1). As a result, the people panicked and cried that night, the 9th of Av (ibid. 14:2). Hashem said, \u201cYou (the Israelites) have cried without cause, therefore I (Hashem) will establish (this day) for crying for generations.\u201d Hence Tisha B\u2019Av was destined as a day of calamity when the Israelites sin grievously.\nLesson: Have faith in Hashem.\nTragedy 2 \u2013 Destruction of First Temple\nThe Talmud (ibid.) notes an apparent discrepancy between verses in scripture related to the destruction of the temple:\n2 Kings 25:8-9 \u2013 \u201cIn the 5th month (i.e. Av) on the 7th of the month \u2026 Nebuzaradan captain of the executioners \u2026 burned the house of Hashem.\u201d\nJeremiah 52:12-13 \u2013 \u201cIn the 5th month on the 10th of the month \u2026 \u2026 Nebuzaradan, captain of the executioners \u2026 burned the house of Hashem.\u201d\nThe Talmud (ibid.) resolves this difference by explaining that the Babylonians entered the sanctuary on the 7th, performed depraved acts on the 7th and 8th, and set fire to the sanctuary in the late afternoon of the 9th. The sanctuary actually burned the entire day of the 10th. Rabbi Yohanan felt that the fast should be observed on the 10th. However the Rabbis set the fast on the 9th because the commemoration should correspond to the beginning of the calamity. Here we see that the 9th of Av occurs within a range of a few days of calamity which sets a pattern across history.\nIt is interesting to note that 2 Chronicles 36:19 mentions the burning of the Sanctuary but does not provide a date. Perhaps this book focuses on the actions of the different Kings of Israel and not on the dates of their defeats.\nCause for the Destruction of the Temple\nThe Talmud investigates the moral cause for the destruction of the temple to answer the obvious question, \u201cWhy did Hashem not protect his people?\u201d The Talmud Yoma 9b answers that the first temple was destroyed because the Israelites committed the three major sins \u2013 idolatry, forbidden marital relations, and murder.\nLesson: The Israelites should follow the Torah and merit divine protection."}

Founded by Sephardic immigrants from Turkey, Greece, and the Ottoman Empire, the center embodies the spirit of a community that left its homelands in search of opportunity and safety, bringing with them rich traditions, language, and customs that have shaped Jewish life in Havana to this day. From its earliest days, the Sephardic Hebrew Center served not only as a synagogue but also as a cultural hub, a place where Ladino songs filled the air, traditional dishes graced Shabbat tables, and Sephardic history and identity were passed down from parents to children.\nOne of the center\u2019s most impactful features is its permanent exhibition, titled \u201cThe Holocaust and the Rebirth of a Living Community.\u201d This powerful display offers a poignant reflection on the tragic fate of European Jewry and the resilience of those who found refuge in Cuba. Through photographs, personal stories, and historical artifacts, the exhibit honors those lost while celebrating the courage of those who rebuilt their lives on Cuban soil. Visitors from around the world, along with locals eager to learn more about the island\u2019s Jewish story, view the exhibit not only as a memorial but also as a testament to the enduring spirit of Jewish survival and renewal.\nA permanent exhibition, titled \u201cThe Holocaust and the Rebirth of a Living Community,\u201d Sephardic Hebrew Center, Havana, New York Jewish Travel Guide\nThe USC Shoah Foundation Institute, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and exhibit design company Conscience Display collaborated on this project. The exhibit serves several functions: it highlights the Jewish community in Cuba, educates Cubans about their Jewish heritage, and sheds light on an important part of Cuban history for visitors from around the world.\nFor decades, religious leadership at the Sephardic Hebrew Center has been supported by Rabbi Eduardo Chaimovitch from Chile. Having made over 200 visits to Cuba, Rabbi Chaimovitch has provided spiritual guidance, led services, and offered leadership training to the local Jewish community. In the absence of a resident rabbi, he has become a beloved and trusted figure, ensuring the continuity of Jewish life and the preservation of traditions in a community that has long relied on visiting clergy. Though not officially recognized as Cuba\u2019s chief rabbi, his unwavering dedication and continuous presence have made him an unofficial spiritual guide, strengthening ties between Cuba\u2019s Jewish community and the broader Latin American Jewish world.\nAlongside him, local leaders like Vice President Samuel Konovalov are resolutely committed to sustaining the community, despite the significant challenge of operating without financial support from the Cuban government. In the face of these obstacles, they tirelessly work to ensure the Sephardic Hebrew Center remains a vital religious and cultural hub for Havana\u2019s Jewish population. Much of the synagogue\u2019s funding comes from international donations, particularly from the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC), which has been supporting Cuba\u2019s Jewish community since 1992. While this external aid has been crucial in funding community programs and maintaining the center\u2019s physical space, the heart of the community\u2019s resilience lies in the determination and perseverance of its members.\nVice President Samuel Konovalov, Sephardic Hebrew Center, Havana, New York Jewish Travel Guide\nAmong the synagogue\u2019s most cherished possessions are its Torah scrolls, each one carrying a unique story that reflects the rich history of Cuban Jewry. As Samuel Konovalov, Vice President of the Sephardic Hebrew Center, shared, \u201cThere are three Torahs; two have been in Cuba for over 100 years, and the third was donated by a congregation from Massachusetts about 10 years ago.\u201d These sacred scrolls serve as a tangible connection between the past and the present, bridging the generations. They link today\u2019s worshippers with the prayers and traditions of their ancestors, who journeyed across oceans to find a new home in Cuba, bringing with them the enduring faith that continues to thrive.\nThe Sephardic Hebrew Center remains a vibrant gathering place for Shabbat dinners and community celebrations. Despite the small Jewish population in Havana, these communal meals are lively occasions, where Mediterranean flavors blend seamlessly with the warmth and hospitality of Cuban culture. These gatherings do more than just strengthen religious observance\u2014they also foster a deep sense of belonging. For younger members, who may otherwise feel disconnected from their heritage, these events play a crucial role in reinforcing their connection to the community and their Sephardic roots.\nSephardic Hebrew Center, Havana, New York Jewish Travel Guide\nDespite the challenges of emigration and an aging population, the Sephardic Hebrew Center remains a beacon of cultural preservation, offering a sense of continuity and connection for both the local community and Jewish visitors from around the world. Currently, the center has approximately 150 active members. Since 1994, when an agreement between Fidel Castro and the Chief Rabbi of Israel allowed any Cuban with at least one Jewish grandparent to immigrate to Israel, many young Cuban Jews have left in search of better economic opportunities and a stronger connection to global Jewish life. This steady emigration, combined with high rates of intermarriage, has posed a continuous challenge to preserving the community\u2019s distinct identity. Yet, the center\u2019s leaders remain steadfast in their commitment to engaging interfaith families and nurturing pride in Sephardic traditions, ensuring that all who wish to participate in cultural and religious events, regardless of background, are warmly welcomed.\nThe resilience of the community is all the more remarkable given Cuba\u2019s complex relationship with religion over the past few decades. While synagogues were never officially closed, practicing Judaism could jeopardize educational and professional opportunities, particularly for those pursuing careers in government. As a result, many Cuban Jews quietly set aside their religious practices or kept their faith hidden. This began to change in 1992 when Cuba officially relaxed restrictions on religious activity, opening the door for a new generation of Jews\u2014many of whom had little exposure to Jewish life\u2014to reconnect with their heritage. Elders, community leaders, and visiting rabbis stepped in, teaching young Cubans the traditions, prayers, and customs they had long been denied. Through these efforts, a sense of Jewish pride and knowledge was rekindled, breathing new life into the community.\nThe Salom\u00f3n Mitrani Z\u2019L Hebrew Center for the Care of the Elderly, Sephardic Hebrew Center, Havana, New York Jewish Travel Guide\nA significant part of the center\u2019s work focuses on the elderly population through the Salom\u00f3n Mitrani Z\u2019L Hebrew Center for the Care of the Elderly, established in the early 2000s. Currently serving approximately 60 seniors, the center offers meals, health assistance, and cultural programs that keep older community members connected to Jewish life even as their mobility decreases. For many of these elderly members, the center is more than just a social space\u2014it is a lifeline to the cultural and religious identity they have worked so hard to preserve.\nDespite its challenges, the Sephardic Hebrew Center remains a vibrant point of contact between Cuba\u2019s Jewish community and visitors from abroad. Hundreds of tourists pass through the center\u2019s doors each year, including Jewish travelers from the United States, Canada, Israel, and Europe, as well as curious Cubans eager to learn about their island\u2019s diverse cultural tapestry. These visitors are welcomed with warmth, often invited to share a Shabbat meal or to learn about the community\u2019s history from those who lived it.\nWhile overt antisemitism is virtually nonexistent in Cuba, assimilation remains a more subtle yet persistent challenge. With a relatively small Jewish population, intermarriage and secularization gradually erode the fabric of communal cohesion. To counter this, the community has implemented educational initiatives, organized holiday celebrations, and forged partnerships with Jewish communities abroad. These efforts help foster pride in Sephardic culture and Jewish identity, even within mixed families.\nSephardic Hebrew Center, Havana, New York Jewish Travel Guide\nThe leaders of the Sephardic Hebrew Center are cautiously optimistic as they look to the future, envisioning a thriving community that continues to honor and preserve the rich heritage of Cuba\u2019s Sephardic Jews. They see the center not only as a place of worship but also as a dynamic hub for cultural preservation and community growth\u2014one where young Cuban Jews can take pride in their Sephardic roots while remaining engaged with the modern world. Central to their vision is the development of leadership programs aimed at nurturing the next generation of community leaders, alongside expanding cultural initiatives that celebrate Sephardic traditions. By deepening connections with Sephardic communities abroad and strengthening ties within their own, they are working to ensure that the legacy of Cuba\u2019s Sephardic Jews not only survives but flourishes, passing on a vibrant and enduring heritage for generations to come.\nFor More information:\nBy Meyer Harroch, New York Jewish Travel Guide & New York Jewish Guide\nThis unforgettable journey was graciously hosted by The Jewish Heritage Travel, with heartfelt thanks to Luis Arteaga and Miriam Levinson for organizing such a remarkable and unique experience.\nA special thanks to Vickie Prince for her knowledgeable and engaging guiding, bringing Havana\u2019s hidden gems and history to life with her insights and enthusiasm.\nFor details on upcoming trips and to request a travel brochure, contact The Jewish Heritage Travel at https://jhtravel.org/ or call 1.845.256.0197."}

You don\u2019t need me to list the daily, growing, global Jew hunting, latest killing, mainstream media\u2019s echoing blood libels. You don\u2019t need me to ask what comes next after you are a colonialist oppressor, an apartheid subhuman Jew. But you do need someone to offer a concrete plan for our survival. \nBack in 2015, a colleague of mine told me, \u201cJews are in a 1,000 year fight for their survival.\u201d He is right. We are now beyond trying to refute the Big Lies. No one is listening. Facts no longer matter. The global intifada, the killing of Jews, Zionists, those who support Israel, is now a \u2018justifiable\u2019 act, met with silence, shrugs or applause. \nIn my Blog, \u201cCanada Needs a New Maple Leaf\u201d I asked,\nhttps://blogs.timesofisrael.com/canada-needs-a-new-maple-leaf/\n\u201cIs there any moral difference between Hamas burning children\u2019s legs in order to mark them, and the Nazis tattooing numbers on Jewish children\u2019s arms? \u201cHamas took every child on a motorbike, put their legs on the exhaust, so they have a burn and will be marked if they run, if they escape, so they can find them\u201d, Times of Israel, Dec. 1, 2023.\u201d\nAnd in my article, How many more times must we bear witness to antisemitism? -Opinion https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-843641  \n\u201cI never thought that in 2023 I would again be sobbing with rage and grief for Jewish Israeli children literally torn apart, beheaded, women raped, their naked, dead bodies stomped on, the dead paraded like war trophies, families trapped, their charred remains found, and a video of a young woman, kidnapped and burned alive, as she writhed on the ground in pain. At least the Nazis gassed us before cremating us, although towards the end, as the Allies were descending, they threw Jewish children alive into the ovens.\u201d\nThe Boulder Colorado\u2019s Jew hating attacker used a \u201cmakeshift flamethrower\u201d and \u201cother incendiary devices to set people on fire\u201d while mainstream media failed to even mention his Jew hate. \nWe don\u2019t need more empty laments, more hand wringing, or more impotent bemoaning. We need Jews\u2026 from little ones to old ones, Jewish men and women, to be fully trained with, equipped and comfortable using a full range of legal items for self defense. We need Jews who fight back, who are intimidating, fierce, who will take down an attacker swiftly and with ease. And make it known to the world that we will not go down quietly. That we\u2019d rather go down fighting, if need be. \nSince 2015, I have been writing about \u201cArming All Jews\u201d, all on deaf Jewish ears. Now I ask again, is it beyond time to heed this call? How many more dead Jews are enough for our Jewish community? If you need role models, look no further than the IDF\u2019s brave men and women. Or emulate the fearless Bielski brothers whose raw, relentless courage saved hundreds of Jews from the Nazis. \u201cThe brothers believed that the group needed to be feared if it had any chance of surviving in such a hostile environment.\u201d https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/bielski-brothers-biography\nDiaspora Jews are fast becoming used to being victims and are beginning to act like victims. Do we need to be reminded that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior? When I was in France in 2015, all Jewish institutions were guarded by armed French soldiers because of assaults on Jews and Jewish institutions. In Paris, I saw no signs of Jews anywhere except for small plaques on buildings telling you how many Jews were rounded up on this corner during WWII. If we learn nothing from our history, it should be that we can never depend upon others to save Jews. We have to protect and save ourselves. \nI will end by citing a hero Rabbi, returning home from synagogue, who was punched in the face but fended off attackers with his gun:\nhttps://worldisraelnews.com/gun-toting-rabbi-fends-off-masked-attackers-in-violent-baltimore-carjacking-attempt/\nNeed I say more?\nGinette Weiner"}

Oh no, you groan, picturing a train, a briefcase, some novels, and a laptop, or possibly the drowsy hum of a bus. But I\u2019m talking about a commute you could never imagine in your wildest dreams. It\u2019s a road that tells stories of a country that continues to evade understanding\u2014a route that speaks of something both ancient and new, a testament to conflict, violence, and different peoples living inches apart.\nA bit of background: I, Ella, live in a southern neighborhood of the nation\u2019s capital, Jerusalem. I teach English and Diplomacy Studies and am also a homeroom teacher.\nTwelve years ago, I worked at a school on the other side of town. Crawling through 14 sets of traffic lights during rush hour was tiresome, but I got fired. Or, to be more precise, was denied tenure.\nIn my frantic search for another job, I saw that a relatively new school in Tzur Hadassah needed an English teacher with high school experience\u2014and that was me.\nYes, Tzur Hadassah is not in Jerusalem, but Waze (the Israeli mapping system) will tell you it\u2019s only 15 kilometers away.\nThe reality? A drive to Tzur Hadassah is a cultural and political space odyssey. It\u2019s also a journey through timelines, geopolitics, radically different neighborhoods, and more than a fair amount of unease.\nOn a good day, this route takes 25 minutes\u2014almost the same time it took to get to my old school. So when I got the job, I thought to myself, *I\u2019d rather navigate a winding country road than inch along in city traffic.* After 11 years on this road, I\u2019m reconsidering that description.\nI average 30 minutes each way. When I have to be at school at an ungodly hour for a field trip, I might even make it in 20.\nI know I could probably find a job within walking distance of my home if I wanted to. But I\u2019ve grown comfortable in Tzur Hadassah. It\u2019s a school in a well-off neighborhood with its perks. It welcomed me with open arms and made me part of a social and academic community. As a result, I\u2019ve grown there. It would be hard to leave and start again.\nAnd so it\u2019s just me and my car. A route that, on the whole, is pleasant\u2014affording me time to make calls, listen to podcasts, or practice singing (yes, I do that) to karaoke tracks. It\u2019s not such a bad thing. I used to rideshare, but honestly, I prefer my own company during my commute.\nI sometimes get strange looks when people ask where I work\u2014especially since almost every school in Israel is desperate for English teachers right now. Some Israelis have never even heard of Tzur Hadassah, so I usually mumble something vague about it being \u201csomewhere between Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh,\u201d which doesn\u2019t clarify much.\nWhat I don\u2019t get to tell them is the real story of this journey.\nTzur Hadassah would technically be labeled a \u201csettlement\u201d (with roughly 13,000 inhabitants), but that\u2019s a politically loaded term. It\u2019s really what you\u2019d call a suburb (though of where, I\u2019m not sure), located *within* the Green Line.\nThe Green Line\u2014the 1949 armistice border\u2014looms large here, though Tzur Hadassah sits just inside it. Beyond lies the West Bank, where half a million Jews live in neighborhoods some call settlements, others call home.\nBut just as people don\u2019t understand lines, lines don\u2019t understand people. Tzur Hadassah is only one kilometer from the Green Line, meaning day-to-day reality\u2014whether you\u2019re Jewish or Arab\u2014can shift dramatically within a few kilometers.\nIt also means that to reach Tzur Hadassah sensibly, I cross the Green Line and back again. Yes, this is where things get weird.\nFrom My Home to the Edge of Town\nI get in my car, find a good podcast or audiobook, dodge incoming cars, and ask myself for the hundredth time why I live in a place that feels like a shopping mall on the weekend every single day. I live in a 15-story building\u2014one of the first towers in this neighborhood but by no means the last.\nI pull out onto the road, dodging parked cars, reversing vehicles, and erratic drivers, then merge onto Derech Hevron, the bustling artery of South Jerusalem. This road has historic origins\u2014it leads to the burial site of our patriarchs, Abraham and Sarah. If you want to visit the Tomb of the Patriarchs, just drive straight.\nThe road has been unrealistically narrowed, so I unconsciously hold my breath when brushing past trucks. Towering cranes dominate the view on both sides\u2014try counting them; you\u2019ll lose track. This road is a testament to a mad rush to *build, build, build* at an epic pace. Givat Hamatos, on my right, was once a no-man\u2019s-land for abandoned cars, inhabited mainly by sheep and olive trees. Now, it\u2019s being developed into a massive neighborhood.\nBelieve it or not, sheep and goats still graze here, herded by East Jerusalem neighbors right beside the four-lane highway.\nTo the left, a bit of history: a 1949 Jordanian bunker on a miraculously unoccupied hill. I pass Mar Elias Monastery, a solemn Greek Orthodox institution that now sits almost out of place\u2014weathered and contemplative\u2014amid rising towers, snarled traffic, and relentless construction. Once surrounded by olive groves and open hills, it now watches silently as cranes swing overhead and cars inch past in a daily frenzy.\nOccasionally, Derech Beit Lehem gets so clogged that Waze (which I don\u2019t always turn on) tentatively suggests a faster route through the Arab neighborhood of Beit Safafa. Nestled next to the Talpiot industrial zone, this historic area\u2014once a self-contained village\u2014is fascinating but terrifying to drive through, though not for obvious reasons. Beit Safafa\u2019s roads are heart-stoppingly narrow, with overwhelming traffic, almost no sidewalks, and blind turns everywhere. I\u2019m a Jerusalemite, but this area feels like another country.\nIn short, there are visible and invisible neighborhoods on my route to work.\nAnd now I\u2019m in Jerusalem\u2019s southernmost neighborhood, Gilo. Technically I\u2019m already \u2018over the green line\u2019 but the Gilo residents wouldn\u2019t agree. They\u2019re Jerusalemites, just like me.\nA sharp right, and there are two turns: one leads to Beit Lehem (Bethlehem to you readers), where Jews aren\u2019t allowed. The last time I was there was twenty-odd years ago. I hear the Christmas lights are lovely.\nEnter the \u2018Tunnel Roads\u2019 \nThe next turn leads to the \u2018tunnel roads,\u2019 as they\u2019re called here. One more traffic light, and you pass the last bus stop, where young hitchhikers heading to \u2018the Gush\u2019 wave expectantly. Sorry, sir, I\u2019m not going your way.  \nA quick explanation: The tunnel roads lead to Areas B and C beyond the Green Line\u2014 in Judea and Samaria, where half a million Jews live.\nAn extra tunnel was added a year ago, easing congestion. A nice gas station recently opened too, attracting a mix of religious Jews, Arabs, Chareidim, and people like me. Everyone loves the coffee and burekas there. Sometimes shakshuka is on the menu.\nThe First Checkpoint  \nDriving into the Palestinian territories, security is minimal. I slow for speed bumps, wave at the soldiers, and suddenly\u2014I\u2019m somewhere else.\nThe real ordeal is returning to Jerusalem: five lanes merging into one, indifferent soldiers, endless waits. But today, I\u2019m not heading home.\nSuddenly, I\u2019m in a place that evades political definition. I can use the road but can\u2019t enter the Arab neighborhoods. Military presence is high. Much of the traffic has PA license plates. People wait by the roadside for buses to take them to work. The road veers left toward the Judea and Samaria, but I turn right.\nVendors sell tissues and car accessories on the roadside. On my way home, beggars with small children sometimes appear at traffic lights, haggling in broken Hebrew before the light changes.\nI see the gentle Judean hills, settlements and towns dotted on hilltops as far as the eye can see, valleys, farms, and endless olive trees. I also see barbed wire fences.\nArab villages nestle behind them. There are giant red signs at their entrance, in Hebrew and in English, warning Jews not to enter.\nThis stretch has a checkered reputation. During tense periods, you might be unlucky enough to have a Molotov cocktail thrown at you. It\u2019s rare, but it happens. Once, I skidded on oil\u2014terrifying, and I wondered if it was deliberate.\nTraffic slows near the Beitar Illit entrance roundabout. Beitar Illit is the last Jewish town before Tzur Hadassah.\nTechnically, Beitar Illit is still \u201cover the Green Line.\u201d If you live in Tzur Hadassah, you can\u2019t just hike across the valley to visit your Jewish neighbors. You must go through the main entrance, cross a security gate, and pass a checkpoint. Not exactly scenic.\nBeitar Illit is clearly visible from my school\u2014but barely accessible. If Tzur Hadassah\u2019s entrance were ever blocked, Beitar Illit would be cut off entirely.\nIt\u2019s a Chareidi town governed by ultra-Orthodox rules. Cars (except ambulances) can\u2019t enter on Shabbat. The town is rabbi-dominated, and schools don\u2019t follow the national curriculum.\nYet, due to large families and high poverty rates, prices for food and household goods are much cheaper than in Tzur Hadassah, where boutique prices are frightening. So, it\u2019s a shopping magnet for Tzur Hadassah residents.\nAs I drive, buses packed with ultra-Orthodox passengers (women in the back, men in front) heave out of the security gate. Black-hatted drivers swerve haphazardly in large cars and secondhand minivans. Meanwhile, Arab workers\u2014indifferent to the heat, their boots caked in paint and cement\u2014line the road. The occasional hawker sits by a makeshift stall selling fruit, eggs, or bootleg goods. Come September, they\u2019ll have fresh figs\u2014hard to resist.\nIf I turned left into Beitar, I\u2019d pass a giant pomegranate monument (four meters tall) in the roundabout\u2019s center. It\u2019s rich in symbolism:\nThe pomegranate is a biblical fruit of Israel.\nIt symbolizes fertility\u2014fitting, since 63% of Beitar\u2019s population is under 18.\nOn the roundabout\u2019s other side lies Wadi Fukin, an Arab village. Wadi Fukin and Beitar Illit are like siblings separated at birth\u2014one rural and agricultural, the other dense and ultra-Orthodox. They sit side by side yet barely acknowledge each other.\nI\u2019ve visited Wadi Fukin\u2014an agricultural village where families pick olives, teens drive old cars on hillsides, and a waterfall cascades in a cave with breathtaking valley views. But I was a guest. I couldn\u2019t just go there. I don\u2019t speak the language, don\u2019t know the culture, and, honestly, I\u2019m scared.\nI\u2019d love to return for makluba and olive-picking, but now isn\u2019t the time. I wonder when it will be.\nIronically, Beitar residents often go to Wadi Fukin for cheap car repairs or dental work,  indifferent to the risk. The news doesn\u2019t care about the daily lives of people caught in the middle\u2014shaped by geopolitics, politics, intrigue, and storytellers who couldn\u2019t care less about those on the ground.\nI know this land carries weighty labels, but to me, it\u2019s a place of board markers and sniper towers, where the hum of my engine muffles the sound of politics.\nThe Second Checkpoint \nThe road narrows. I pass the area\u2019s cheapest carwash, where workers are so young I wonder if they even attend school. A stonemason, a gas station, and a great plant shop (where I buy flowers for school events) dot the roadside.\nTraffic slows again. Wild, mangy dogs lounge by the road\u2014a sight you\u2019d never see in Jerusalem. They flick their ears and gaze indifferently. The checkpoint is their strategic resting spot; soldiers sometimes feed them leftovers.\nIf security alerts are high, I might wait 10-15 minutes in a single lane.\nWe\u2019re re-entering the Green Line. Police stop vehicles, check IDs, and inspect trunks based on the car and driver. It\u2019s not routine harassment\u2014though for some, it is. This country has lost thousands to terror attacks, some at these very checkpoints.\nI rarely get stopped. A middle-aged, bareheaded, smiling woman in a Toyota Corolla? Not a threat. Unless Olga is manning the checkpoint.\nOlga, a career officer (training to be a commander), was my student years ago. Cheeky, tomboyish, and obsessed with her cats, she struggled with English until I tutored her. Now, she\u2019s armed head-to-toe but still dreams of Pilates and a Far East trip with her boyfriend\u2014unless another war breaks out.\nShe laughs when I ask if the heavy gear bothers her. We high-five through my window, and she promises to attend our school\u2019s Memorial Day ceremony\u2014where my former students, now in uniform, look terrifyingly grown-up.\nNow, I\u2019m back inside the Green Line. My mind shifts from borders to my classroom. Eight minutes until I hunt for parking (always taken by 12th graders). Eleven minutes until I walk into the high school building.\nI pass the residential security gate, wave at the guard, and officially enter Tzur Hadassah.\nI pass the Sansan neighborhood\u2014tree-lined, with spacious homes where kids jump on trampolines and families plan vacations to Austria or Thailand. Clean streets, joggers, dog walkers, electric cars, and 4x4s. I pass the familiar Jerusalem stone red-roofed apartment buildings. Memorial images of fallen soldiers (locals) and yellow ribbons for hostages (500+ days in Gaza\u2014hard to believe) are posted on the fence next to the road.\nNo Arabs in worn-out shoes, no black hats, no packed buses (except school ones). Just people who, at first glance, could be from Copenhagen, Texas, or S\u00e3o Paulo.\nI\u2019m almost at school. Eyes skimmed for a parking spot.\nThen, my students: \u201cHiiii, Ella!\u201d they yell, waving, backpacks bouncing, chattering about scouts.\nMany think I live here. At their age, it\u2019s hard to imagine people elsewhere.\nBut I see those places too clearly\u2014hijabs and wigs, black hats and fresh eggs, poverty and wealth, mosques and synagogues. Above all, politics.\nYet in the end, all there was, is, and will ever be\u2014are people. Like me, they travel this strange road of contrasts and connections. Sometimes, they stop, step away from the noise, and look up at the sky.\nBecause it\u2019s the same one\u2014for all of us."}
{"website": "timesofisrael", "url": null, "title": "Hollywood Veteran Turns to Jewish History", "date": "JUN 8, 2025, 9:12 PM", "media_type": "blog", "link": null, "content": "Stanley Isaacs, a seasoned filmmaker known for the last decade for chronicling Hollywood\u2019s golden years, is now turning his lens to a deeper, more personal subject: the Jewish experience, or more so, the human experience with stories that encompass stories of love and hate, tragedy and triumph.\nWhile others of his generation are winding down, Isaacs has teamed with producer Dan Kodsi to launch Envision Pictures. The companies mission statement is to bring history to life through timeless sagas that are thrilling spiritual journeys filled with love, suspense, and drama. Stories that seamlessly blend historical facts, written scripture, and omnipresent light. Each film will be crafted to entertain and illuminate, leaving audiences inspired and moved by true events that have shaped our world. Their first two projects are \u201c8 Days of Light and \u201cPurim Fest 1946.\u201d The films blend history, mysticism and fiction, interweaving biblical themes, holidays, and lesser-known chapters of Jewish heritage into what Isaacs calls \u201cspiritual adventures.\u201d\nWith \u201c8 Days of Light\u201d and \u201cPurim Fest 1946,\u201d Issac laces mythology and Holocaust, prophets and persecution, into a tapestry of love and triumph. And always, there is the story behind the story: how a man in search of the next story to tell found inspiration and enlightenment from a series of seemingly random encounters. For as long as he can recall, Isaacs has believed \u201ceverything in life happens at the exact moment it is supposed to and not a moment before.\u201d\nStanley Isaacs\u2019 fascination with storytelling traces back to his formative years in 1950s New York. Captivated by early television and biblical tales from Hebrew school, Isaacs developed an enduring appreciation for narratives that bridged imagination and morality. While not religious, he gravitated toward grand themes of faith and endurance\u2014qualities he would later seek to explore cinematically. Films such as \u201cThe Ten Commandments\u201d and \u201cBen Hur\u201d left an indelible mark, offering both spectacle and meaning that shaped his lifelong journey through film.\nHe lived in New York, in a time when the milk was glass-bottled and the streets still smelled like horse carts in the morning. He wasn\u2019t sure about God, but he liked the sound of old prophets\u2019 names. At Hebrew school, the rabbi would talk about Moses and moral courage, and Stanley would think, \u201cThis could be a movie.\u201d\nAnd boom\u2014Hollywood had its hooks in him.\nA little Jewish boy in New York watches Charlton Heston yell at the sky and decides, somehow, that the universe can be edited. This is Stanley Isaacs. He doesn\u2019t believe all the hocus-pocus, but he loves a good Exodus.\nIsaacs didn\u2019t set out to be a religious man. He wasn\u2019t. But he listened. He wasn\u2019t moved by doctrine. He was moved by spectacle. By struggle. By burning bushes and big truths. He watched The Ten Commandments not for Moses, but for what Moses represented: the storyteller who stood between people and the void. That\u2019s what Stanley wanted to be.\nPicture a boy in Queens, circa 1953. A black-and-white television flickers with miracles and monsters. Films like \u201cKing Kong\u201d and \u201cThings to Come\u201d stimulate his imagination with their vision and spectacle. A dreamer not of gods, but of storylines. He doesn\u2019t pray. He imagines. He doesn\u2019t worship. He watches.\nIsaacs arrived in Los Angeles at 21, at the dawn of an era defined by handshakes, film reels, and far fewer lawyers. He broke into Hollywood during the late 1970s, serving as an associate producer on a modestly budgeted film. Isaacs considered it a vital entry point into the industry.\nHowever, it was a terrible movie. Total disaster. It tanked. Nobody watched it. Nobody cared. It was perfect. Baptism by fire, he called it. He\u2019s an optimist. Then, as fate would have it, he got a meeting at Disney.\nDisney\u2019s decision to greenlight a script from an unknown writer was less anomalous than it would be today. For Isaacs, it was astonishing.\nThe studio offered him a writing/producing deal\u2014a common practice then, as studios invested in development, often stockpiling scripts they\u2019d never produce. Back then, studios actually paid writers to write, even if the script ended up on a shelf.\nIssacs spent the next year immersed in the process. The film was ultimately put in \u201cturnaround,\u201d but the experience launched his screenwriting career.\nBefore home video and streaming, the Hollywood studio system wielded enormous influence. Film schools flourished and aspiring screenwriters flooded Los Angeles, hoping to catch a break. It was a moment saturated with ambition. Esquire magazine famously featured a chimp at a typewriter, satirizing the screenwriting boom.\nBut the early 1980s marked a turning point. A Writers Guild strike curbed the once-common practice of studio-funded script development. Home video revolutionized the business model again. Films bypassed theaters and found success in the rental market, especially in genre niches like horror. Streaming would ultimately do the same\u2014opening new doors while closing others.\nThrough it all, Isaacs endured, adapting as each wave reshaped the industry. Isaacs\u2019 career trajectory spanned more than four decades. He earned his first major screen credit with \u201cGross Anatomy,\u201d a 1989 Disney feature centered on the bonds formed by medical students.\nHis producing and writing work gained momentum in the mid-90\u2019s with \u201cLast Gasp,\u201d a horror-thriller that found an audience through the then-burgeoning direct-to-video market.\nOver the years, wanting to recreate the horror/monster films he saw as a kid every Saturday at his favorite movie haunts, he contributed to a series of genre films distributed by the Sci-Fi Channel.\nIn search of greater challenges, Isaacs turned to documentary filmmaking. His subject matter, his friends, fellow producers who shared their behind-the-scenes struggles and triumphs in bringing some of the greatest movies to life. Stories Isaacs wanted preserved for future generations of film students as well as film historians. His documentary \u201cTough Ain\u2019t Enough\u201d offered an intimate look into Albert S. Ruddy\u2019s journey through \u201cThe Godfather\u201d and \u201cMillion Dollar Baby\u201d. Issacs followed with \u201cIt\u2019s Always About the Story,\u201d a tribute to Alan Ladd Jr., chronicling the former studio head\u2019s pivotal role in shaping modern Hollywood\u2014from \u201cStar Wars\u201d to \u201cBraveheart.\u201d\nStan Issacs and Mel Brooks (Photo courtesy of Stan Issacs)\nFeaturing a candid interview with Mel Brooks, the film underscored Isaacs\u2019 access and reverence for the industry\u2019s titans. \u201cSometimes Lucky Is Better Than Smart,\u201d examined Mace Neufeld\u2019s legacy, from \u201cThe Omen\u201d to the Jack Ryan franchise. A conversation with Harrison Ford adds to the reflection.\nIn 2019, after five decades in Los Angeles, Isaacs, left California in search of new creative opportunities and moved to Miami. He was drawn by its climate, culture, and emerging creative energy.\nThere, he met Dan Kodsi, a Miami real estate developer with cinematic ambitions. Isaacs had initially approached Kodsi with a script, hoping for investment. Instead, Kodsi replied: \u201cIf I ever make a movie, it\u2019ll be the one I\u2019ve dreamed of since I was a kid.\u201d Thus began a collaboration that would result in two feature screenplays\u2014each rooted in Jewish history and antisemitism.\n\u201c8 Days of Light,\u201d a biblical epic set-in ancient Jerusalem, tells the story of two friends\u2014spiritual companions whose fates split during wartime, and is set against the ancient war between monotheism and polytheism.\nJerusalem, Year Zero.\nIn \u201c8 Days of Light,\u201d spiritual truth collides with military ambition. And the two men\u2014once united in faith\u2014become bitter adversaries on opposite sides of a conflict. The sister of one finds love with the other, a union forbidden by both families and ideologies.\nThe woman caught between them is both a bridge and a curse.\nTheir tale echoes the themes of the dawn of monotheism, and the death of pagan empires.\n\u201cPurim Fest 1946\u201d has its roots in something dark: the final words of Julius Streicher before he was hanged after the Nurenburg trials.\nAnd love shows up where it isn\u2019t supposed to. In Nazi Germany, a Jewish girl disguised as a German falls for a Nazi officer. The soldier doesn\u2019t pretend\u2014he just refuses to hate. They fall in love while the world falls apart.\nTogether, they unravel the horror. Together, they survive\u2014or try to. Through the eyes of a Jewish girl living undercover in Nazi Germany, the film explores love, resistance, and identity in an age of genocide. The story is timeless \u2014because hatred, tragically, is too.\nThis isn\u2019t just history. It\u2019s prophecy. It\u2019s nightmare.\nDespite the backdrop of violence, the films are love stories\u2014intimate portraits set against epic backdrops.\nFor Isaacs, the creative journey became a spiritual one. He likened it to boarding a boat with no sail, rudder, or engine\u2014allowing life\u2019s current to reveal purpose. He now views his past not as random events, but as pieces of a mosaic\u2014one he believes was divinely arranged.\nIsaacs shows no signs of slowing down. With two feature films already in motion, he remains steadfast in his commitment to storytelling as a form of moral engagement.\n\u201cTo influence what people believe, what they value\u2014film can be a vessel,\u201d Issacs said in a recent interview. \u201cIf advertising can change how we shop, stories can change how we live.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not stopping after these two films. He can\u2019t. Because something inside him\u2014fierce and familiar\u2014keeps whispering: Tell it again. Tell it better. Tell it true. Combining his two favorite genres, spiritual drama with science fiction, he has also co-created \u201cDeus\u201d a script that poses the ultimate question, with mankind on the brink of extinction and given a second chance by A. I., could humanity rise above its chaotic differences and build a new world of peace and unity?\nHe says, \u201ca story should make you want to love, forgive, or stand up.\u201d\nStan Issac\u2019s and Harrison Ford (Photo courtesy of Stan Issacs)\nHe\u2019s not your average screenwriter.\nHe looks at the state of the world and says, \u201cMore movies.\u201d\nNot because they\u2019d fix everything. But because stories might be the only antidote we have to amnesia.\nBecause someone has to keep track of who did what, when, and why; that stories can be weapons\u2014or shields.\nAnd maybe, just maybe, someone watching will decide not to repeat it and possibly stand up against the evil.\nA man who sees films not as fantasy, but as lifeboats for conscience.\nBecause in the flickering light of the screen, he sees not just shadows\u2014but a way forward to a brighter future."}

Nothing equal in any way. He stays for 40 days, descends to the desert and scales the mountain again \u2014 engaging with God anew to receive a second set of Tablets. These, the only instances since Creation that God connected thusly, in an I, Thou relationship, with a member of mankind.\nConsider this, though. There has never been a Mrs. God. No significant other. No other Gods with whom to interact. No children in the conventional sense. No confidante or advisor on God\u2019s plain. Moses did, yes, sometimes talk God down from his anger \u2013 but with  no human-like expression of gratitude for the persuasiveness he presented.  God and Moses weren\u2019t friends or peers in any meaningful way.\nOf course, we must, necessarily, imagine God in human terms. Given the human limitations of our understanding of Him, we anthropomorphize God and His conduct to try to fathom His realm, His thinking and His very manner.\nAnd if we would seek to comprehend how God chose to create the gradations of both earthly and heavenly figures for His world order, we might query the reason for God\u2019s seeming desire for aloneness. This being a continuous aloneness, even given His relationship with Moses at that brief moment so long ago. Or apart from His supposed interaction with those subordinate and ethereal angels (with whom God never actually engaged in the Torah itself). So why did God create a world for Himself of almost infinite aloneness relegating God to possibly saying to Himself: \u201cI\u2019m not alone. My people dedicate themselves to Me.\u201d\nAnd yes, perhaps God\u2019s \u201caloneness\u201d somehow subsides when mankind bows, even if that genuflection is essentially demanded of them.  Meaning, would God still maintain mankind\u2019s engagement with Him if He didn\u2019t insist on it sacrificing or praying to Him?\nIn the Torah God largely doesn\u2019t talks about Himself, beyond describing His occasional anger, or His satisfaction with the days of creation. There are no expressions of joy as in the instance of humans. Loners can of course find joy when alone, but seemingly not nearly as when people interact with another. Did God not recognize when He designed the world that His isolation would likely limit His own personal joy? That said, does His isolation withhold from God a capacity to better understand the nature of the very mankind He created?\nOr are these, perhaps, the vapid musings of the earthbound individuals who God intentionally created with limitations designed to keep His existence behind a stone wall? But is He lonely? Or perhaps He simply wants us to endure the mystery designed to maintain His inapproachability.\nDid Moses, better than we, understand God\u2019s nature when he stood atop Sinai and interacted with Him? And does God even want the rest of us to wonder about it, or to just be relegated to abiding the profound mystery of it all?"}

Gadi Moses, a 79-year-old Israeli agro-expert, had been abducted by Hamas from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7 massacre and was still being held captive in Gaza.\nHis children attended the 2023 event in Georgia, holding on to hope \u2014 hope that their father would return. That he would live. That he would celebrate freedom again.\nThis year, in a moment few dared to imagine, Gadi Moses himself stood among the guests.\nEmbassy Press Office\nHe had been freed in a hostage deal in January. And now, at Israel\u2019s 76th Independence Day celebration in Georgia, he was present \u2014 not as a victim, but as a living reminder of resilience, survival, and the ongoing pain of families still waiting for their loved ones to come home.\nThe reception, hosted by the Israeli Embassy in Georgia, was filled with local officials, Jewish community leaders, diplomats, and friends of Israel. But it was Gadi\u2019s quiet presence that spoke the loudest. A survivor, a father, a symbol of both unimaginable suffering and the unbreakable human spirit.\nIn brief remarks, Israeli Ambassador Hadas Meitzad noted: \u201cLast year, we stood with his children. This year, we stand with Gadi himself. But we do so knowing that others are still in the darkness of captivity. Until they all return, our hearts cannot be fully free.\u201d\nGadi Moses and Hadas Meitzad (Photo by Embassy Press Office)\nGadi was seen speaking warmly with Georgian friends, including local Jewish community members and civil figures. Despite the weight of his experience, he smiled. He was alive. And for a brief moment, that was enough.\nGadi Moses and Mikheil Khachidze (Photo by Salome Tsereteli)\nThe story of Gadi Moses \u2014 a story of trauma, endurance, and hope \u2014 now links Georgia and Israel not only through diplomacy, but through the shared human values of compassion and memory.\nGadi Moses is a beloved agro-expert known for sincerely sharing his knowledge with farmers and supporting their success for many years. His experience and practical advice play a significant role in advancing agriculture in Georgia. Gadi\u2019s name is associated with high-quality produce, healthy soil, and effective agricultural techniques.\nAuthor\u2019s Note:\nLast year, I stood next to Gadi\u2019s children at the same embassy. I remember the uncertainty in their eyes. Yesterday, I stood next to Gadi himself. His silence was powerful. His presence, even more so. In Israel and in Georgia, his story reminds us that freedom is not just a national value \u2014 it is deeply, painfully personal."}

He gave Ulloa a personal letter to bring to Francisco Smith, the leader of the striking banana workers\u2019 union.In the letter, Mulino says he committed to sending proposed legislation to the Congress that would be favorable for the country\u2019s banana sector, above all its workers.

He is likely to face questions under oath not only about his handling of sensitive information but also the wider turmoil at the Pentagon following the departures of several senior aides and an internal investigation over information leaks.Hegseth already has faced questions over the installation of an unsecured internet line in his office that bypassed the Pentagon\u2019s security protocols and revelations that he shared details about the military strikes in multiple Signal chats.One of the chats included his wife and brother, while the other included US President Donald Trump\u2019s top national security officials and inadvertently included The Atlantic\u2019s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg.Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson has no comment, citing the pending investigation. The inspector general\u2019s office would not discuss the details of the investigation but says that when the report is complete, their office will release unclassified portions of it to the public.Besides finding out whether anyone was asked to delete Signal messages, the inspector general also is asking some past and current staffers who were with Hegseth on the day of the strikes who posted the information and who had access to his phone, according to the two people familiar with the investigation and the documents reviewed by the AP. The people were not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity.Democratic lawmakers and a small number of Republicans have said that the information Hegseth posted to the Signal chats before the military jets had reached their targets could have put those pilots\u2019 lives at risk and that for any lower-ranking members of the military it would have led to their firing.Hegseth has said none of the information was classified. Multiple current and former military officials have said there is no way details with that specificity, especially before a strike took place, would have been OK to share on an unsecured device."}

Many have reported making the trek of dozens of kilometers only for them to arrive after boxes of food have run out.The limited food is also likely what has led to the overcrowding, with hunger still plaguing much of the Strip after a 78-day Israeli blockade through most of March, April and May.GHF says it has distributed roughly 25,000 boxes of food since it began operations late last month, but families with men and boys strong enough to make the trek, wait in line and lug large boxes back to their homes have a major advantage over others. The boxes are filled largely with dry food products that to prepare still require cooking equipment or community kitchens, which are in very low supply throughout the war-ravaged Strip.GHF does not say how much aid it distributed at its sites on Friday, but a spokesperson says GHF will resume operations on Saturday.While GHF has been operating three distribution sites, only one or two have been open on most days since the May 26 rollout, and no timeline has been provided for when a site in northern Gaza will be opened.The small number of distribution sites aimed at serving a population of roughly two million has been a major point of criticism from the UN and other international organizations, who have argued that Palestinians in need should not be forced to walk long distances through war zones in order to pick up food.The dangerous conditions were highlighted earlier this week when the IDF, three days in a row, admitted to opening fire toward Palestinians who it said had strayed from the pre-approved road they\u2019re supposed to use to reach aid sites. Dozens were killed and hundreds were injured in the three incidents, according to Hamas health authorities and the Red Cross. The IDF insisted that those figures were exaggerated and described its fire as warning shots."}

Hausdorff raised concerns about the use of AI-generated imagery in early reports on an Israeli airstrike that allegedly killed several children in Gaza. Morgan cut her off, called her \u201cdespicable,\u201d and went on to interrupt her dozens of times.\nIn response, Hausdorff wrote a piece in The Spectator titled Why can\u2019t Piers Morgan handle the truth about Israel?, arguing that Morgan \u2013 and much of the Western media \u2013 are unwilling to confront the legal and moral facts about Israel\u2019s conduct in the war. She accused him of censorship, emotional grandstanding, and a refusal to engage seriously with pro-Israel voices.\nThere\u2019s truth in her critique. But her answer to the question posed in her title \u2013 why Morgan can\u2019t handle the truth \u2013 falls short. She frames it as media bias and ego: \u201cDefence of fake images in pursuit of a \u2018good story\u2019 is, of course, old ground for Morgan.\u201d\nBut the reality goes deeper. Morgan\u2019s problem isn\u2019t just hostility or theatrical journalism. It\u2019s moral evasion. And Hausdorff, in focusing on media bias, lets him off too easily.\nMorgan isn\u2019t just parroting anti-Israel talking points \u2013 he\u2019s not a propagandist. He\u2019s something else: a man deeply uncomfortable with what moral clarity in this war actually requires. He wants to believe there\u2019s a way to conduct this war that doesn\u2019t involve so much suffering. But the brutal truth is: there isn\u2019t.\nHamas constructed Gaza to ensure that any meaningful attempt to dismantle its terror infrastructure will require maximum civilian suffering. The suffering isn\u2019t a side effect \u2013 it\u2019s the central feature of Hamas\u2019s strategy: to embed among civilians, to ensure civilian casualties, and to weaponize those casualties as part of a global propaganda campaign aimed at weakening Israel\u2019s international standing and forcing a halt to the fighting before Israel can achieve its goals.\nAny honest conversation begins with this premise: if Hamas makes Israeli self-defense contingent upon Gazan civilian deaths, then either Israel needs to forgo adequate self-defense, or it has to accept those deaths as the price of achieving its own self-defense. The moral answer is that Israel may \u2013 and must \u2013 defend itself, even at this terrible cost.\nHausdorff accuses Morgan of past hypocrisy, performative outrage, and media malpractice. She\u2019s not wrong. But her response fails to address the real tension. She dismisses Morgan as just another biased hack when what\u2019s actually going on is a much deeper moral discomfort \u2013 a refusal to accept the logic of a war that Hamas has designed to be unwinnable without horror.\nMorgan doesn\u2019t want to live in a world where adequate self-defense necessitates widespread civilian death. So instead of confronting that fact, he denies it. He insists, in various ways, that there must be another way. But there isn\u2019t. And by refusing to face this, he ends up implying \u2013 whether he means to or not \u2013 that Israel must not do what is necessary to defend itself.\nThat\u2019s the deeper evasion. That\u2019s the reason for the emotion, the outrage, the moral indignation aimed at Hausdorff when she questioned the presentation of a tragic story. He interprets doubt as cruelty because he cannot tolerate the moral complexity at the heart of this war.\nIf Hausdorff had addressed that truth, either during her conversation with Morgan or in her subsequent article, her position would have been far stronger. Instead, by treating Morgan like a propagandist rather than a man struggling with a hard truth, she misses the moment \u2013 and fails to articulate the moral clarity this debate so badly demands."}

I was in touch with my mother and cousins following the firebombing attack on people marching to call attention to the hostages held in Gaza. Some of my cousin\u2019s children attend school in Boulder. This was not far away. In my mind, I can visualize exactly where it happened.\nIn just the last 50 days: arson at the Pennsylvania governor\u2019s residence; assaults on Jews in the streets; vandalism of schools, synagogues and businesses; two murdered outside a Jewish event in Washington, D.C., and a firebomb attack on a peaceful gathering in Boulder that injured 15, including a Holocaust survivor.\nIn several of these cases, attackers shouted, \u201cFree Palestine.\u201d Or they said it when they were caught. Or the graffiti they wrote said it. These are not political statements. These are acts of antisemitic terror.\nBut something else makes this moment even more painful.\nThe silence.\nI serve as the senior rabbi of Temple Beth El, the largest synagogue in the Carolinas. For years, our clergy and community have shown up. We have marched for racial justice, stood for LGBTQ+ rights, defended reproductive freedom, and worked alongside churches, faith communities of every kind and community partners to build a more just Charlotte. We have worked steadfastly with public schools and stood arm in arm at vigils and rallies. We showed up, again and again, because our faith commands us to.\nAnd now, as Jews are being attacked in the streets, harassed on campuses and set on fire, the silence from many of our trusted partners is devastating.\nWe have not heard from many of the clergy or political leaders who regularly speak out for compassion, equity, and peace.\nWe have not heard from those who have insisted repeatedly that anti-Zionism is not antisemitism.\nWhen Jews are targeted, burned, and killed under banners of \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d those voices have now fallen all too silent.\nThat silence sends a deafening message: that Jewish safety is negotiable. That Jewish lives are less urgent. That the grief of Jews burned alive is not worthy of their compassion or outrage. It leaves us feeling alone. It forces us to wonder if our pain is visible. If our safety matters.\nThis is not a time to stay quiet. It is time to be brave. A time to speak with the same moral clarity we have offered to others.\nTo our friends, our partners in justice, our fellow clergy, our neighbors in the work of healing the world: Where are you?\nIf you believe in peace, now is the time to say that violence is never acceptable.\nIf you believe in justice, now is the time to reject hatred in all its forms.\nIf you believe that all people are created in the image of God (the text you cite is Jewish, by the way), now is the time to say that Jewish people are also created in the image of God.\nYou can oppose war and still condemn terror.\nYou can grieve for Gaza and innocent life and still say that burning Jews alive is wrong.\nYou can challenge Israeli policy and still know that Jews everywhere are not responsible for it.\nIf you care about justice, say something. Stand for what is right. Do not let hate go unanswered.\nWhy? Because there is no liberation in setting people on fire. There is no justice in chasing Jews from public spaces. There is no righteousness in staying silent. And you should know that hatred that is allowed to grow never stays contained. It always spreads. It always finds new victims and the people peddling in it will always create new grievances to justify more violence.\nSay something. Silence is not love. Silence feels like abandonment. And silence will certainly not protect us. We need you to speak up. We have marched beside you. We have prayed with you. We have stood together for justice. Please do not disappear. We are still here. We need to know that you are too.\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of JTA or its parent company, 70 Faces Media."}

Not where it counts most", "date": "JUN 6, 2025, 6:24 PM", "media_type": "blog", "link": null, "content": "Lately, I\u2019ve been having these strange moments. I\u2019ll be reading, or teaching, or cooking \u2014 and a quiet thought creeps in: Will AI replace me?\nIt\u2019s not always a dark thought. Sometimes it\u2019s simple curiosity. But beneath it lies a deeper question many of us are asking. In a world of looming superintelligence and advanced robotics: What makes me irreplaceable?\nIt\u2019s unsettling to imagine that many of the qualities we take pride in \u2014 intelligence, creativity, even productivity \u2014 might one day be performed better and faster by machines.\nBut alongside those flickers of unease, I\u2019ve been having another kind of moment \u2014 moments of clarity and grounding. Moments that feel utterly, defiantly human.\nThis past Shavuot, I was lying in a hammock beneath the trees when my 5-year-old climbed into my arms. We nestled into one of our \u201ccuddle sessions.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just a hug \u2014 I was trying to make her feel, deep in her little body, that she is loved.\nFor being her. For being mine.\nIn that moment, I thought: No machine will ever be able to do this. Not like this.\nLove \u2014 embodied, intentional, unconditional, singular \u2014 cannot be automated.\nThis isn\u2019t just what makes us human. It\u2019s what reveals the divinity we carry.\nAnd it\u2019s exactly what sits at the heart of this week\u2019s Torah portion.\n* * *\nParashat Naso continues the Israelites\u2019 preparations to leave Sinai and journey toward the Promised Land.\nAmid the logistics, the Torah offers one of its most enduring gifts: Birkat Kohanim, the priestly blessing. The priests are called to serve as conduits of God\u2019s blessing to the Jewish people:\n\u05d9\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05db\u05b0\u05da\u05b8 \u05d4\u05f3 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b6\u05da\u05b8\nMay God bless you and protect you\n\u05d9\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05f3 \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b8\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u05b6\u05d9\u05da\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b4\u05d9\u05d7\u05bb\u05e0\u05b6\u05bc\u05da\u05b8\u05bc\nMay God shine His face upon you and be gracious to you\n\u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b8\u05bc\u05c2\u05d0 \u05d4\u05f3 \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b8\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u05b6\u05d9\u05da\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05e9\u05b5\u05c2\u05dd \u05dc\u05b0\u05da\u05b8 \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05dc\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd\nMay God lift His face toward you and grant you peace\u201d\nWe still recite Birkat Kohanim today \u2014 on holidays in Ashkenazic synagogues, and daily in Sephardic ones. I have the joy of receiving this blessing often from both my husband and my son.\nBut there\u2019s a detail in Jewish law about this blessing that has always struck me.\nThe Mishnah Berurah explains: \u201cIf a priest harbors hatred toward the people \u2014 or if the people hate him \u2014 it is dangerous for him to deliver the blessing.\u201d This is why before they bless the congregation, priests must first declare \u2014 loudly \u2014 that they are blessing \u201cwith love.\u201d\nLove, in other words, is not optional. Love is required as a precondition for blessing.\nWhich brings us back to AI.\n* * *\nMachines can already simulate love \u2014 offering soothing words, warm expressions, even companionship. Children form emotional bonds with social robots. Elderly patients respond to robotic caregivers. Soon, perhaps, we\u2019ll have blessings on demand.\nFor some, that\u2019s enough. If it feels like love, they ask, why insist on whether it\u2019s real? If a machine can replicate the gestures of love and deliver comfort, who cares if it cannot choose to love?\nBut the Torah cares.\nBecause the choice to love \u2014 freely, consciously, with intention \u2014 is a uniquely human capacity. And in the Torah\u2019s view, that choice is what gives a blessing its power.\nTo bless is not just to recite sacred words. It is to channel something divine. And that, our tradition insists, requires love \u2014 deliberate, willed, and utterly human.\nAs machines become increasingly able to replicate us, Judaism offers a counter-claim: our capacity to love with intention is one of the things that make us irreplaceable.\nBut irreplaceability isn\u2019t the endpoint \u2014 it\u2019s an invitation.\nIf intentional love is part of what defines us as human in the Genesis sense \u2014 bearers of divinity, not just products of evolution \u2014 then this is the terrain where our spiritual lives must deepen.\nThe question shifts from \u201cCan I be replaced?\u201d to \u201cIn the areas that are uniquely human, how do I grow this divine capacity?\u201d\nThe issue isn\u2019t just what machines can do \u2014 it\u2019s whether we\u2019ll have the wisdom and courage to orient our lives toward sacred human work.\nThis lens has helped me understand the deep sense of purpose I feel each Shabbat when I bless my children \u2014 a moment that takes place in countless Jewish homes around the world.\nParents place their hands on their children\u2019s heads and recite the ancient words from Naso. The priestly blessing becomes a parental one.\nWhen I bless my children, I do what my parents did \u2014 and still do \u2014 for me. I hold them close. I whisper the Torah\u2019s words. Then I add my own: the beauty I saw in them that week, a kindness they offered, a question that made me proud. I try, in a moment, to offer a vision of who they\u2019re becoming. I intend to love them.\nWhen we place our hands on our children\u2019s heads and bless them, when we choose to love with intention \u2014 in friendship, in care, in the relationships we tend and honor \u2014 we\u2019re practicing what it means to be human in God\u2019s image.\nNo algorithm can do this."}

The resolution made no mention of the October 7th massacre\u2014the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. It did not acknowledge the more than 1,200 people slaughtered by Hamas, the rapes, the kidnappings, or the more than 100 hostages still held in Gaza. Not one name. Not one word. Not one candle.\nThis is what it means to be a Jew in the US today.\nBut to understand the danger of this moment, you need to understand its context. The rise in antisemitism here in Maine is not happening in a vacuum.\nHistorically, Maine was not built to welcome Jews. In the early 20th century, signs in hotel windows in Bar Harbor and Kennebunkport read \u201cNo Jews or Dogs Allowed.\u201d In 1919, Hebrew School students in Old Orchard Beach were threatened by a local mob. Jewish college students were denied entry into fraternities. Country clubs, coastal real estate, and leadership positions in public institutions were, for decades, closed off to Jews.\nWe built anyway. We stayed anyway. And still\u2014too often\u2014we have remained invisible.\nWhen you are Jewish, you learn to keep one eye on your neighbors and one on the exits. You learn that safety can be conditional. That you can be embraced in one breath and erased in the next.\nAnd yet, I chose this.\nI became Jewish not because it was easy or fashionable, but because Judaism gave me a framework for dignity, justice, accountability, and resilience. It gave me language for what I already believed: that we are responsible for one another, that we are commanded to remember, that peace is holy but not passive.\nWe were not handed Judaism. We inherited it, defended it, rebuilt it\u2014and in some cases, like mine\u2014we ran toward it with open arms, because we knew it to be a source of light in a world that often goes dark.\nBut in the darkness of today\u2019s political moment, I am forced to ask: Where are the people who we once marched beside? Where are the clergy, the city councilors, the nonprofit leaders who claim to stand for equity and inclusion?\nYou cannot say \u201cNever Again\u201d while defending Hamas.\nYou cannot fight white supremacy while ignoring Jewish trauma.\nYou cannot preach justice while rendering Jews unworthy of empathy.\nAnd yet, this is precisely what is happening\u2014not just globally, but right here in my own backyard.\nIn Maine, the ADL reported that antisemitic incidents quadrupled in 2023\u2014a staggering and deeply personal statistic in a state with a growing, but still relatively small Jewish population. We\u2019ve seen this uptick reflected not just in swastikas and slurs, but in policy, protest, and polite indifference.\nNationally, the past few weeks alone have been chilling. A young couple working for the Israeli Embassy was shot and killed outside the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC. Molotov cocktails were thrown at Jewish centers in Colorado. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, the state\u2019s first Jewish governor, had his family home set on fire in an arson attack.\nAnd while the press continues to rush out unverified or deeply flawed reporting in favor of clicks, corrections\u2014when they come\u2014arrive far too late to undo the damage. In early June, The Washington Post was forced to revise a story that blamed Israel for the deaths of over 30 Palestinians near a Rafah aid site, admitting it had failed to meet its own standards by omitting Israel\u2019s denial and relying solely on Hamas-run sources. Earlier this year, the BBC apologized for airing a Gaza warzone documentary narrated by the son of a senior Hamas official\u2014without disclosing the connection. CNN, The New York Times, Al Jazeera\u2014all have published or aired explosive claims that were later retracted, corrected, or quietly removed. The lie goes viral. The truth gets buried.\nWe are not imagining this.\nAnd still, I know: not every Jew sees it the same way.\nNot every Jew is a Zionist. Not every Jew loves or defends Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people. There have always been internal Jewish movements, even historically grotesque ones\u2014like \u201cJews for Hitler\u201d\u2014that took pride in their alienation from the larger collective.\nBut let\u2019s be clear: the existence of dissent within the Jewish community does not grant moral authority to those outside it who weaponize that dissent to excuse or amplify hatred. There are white nationalists and terror apologists hiding in plain sight under the banner of \u201cFree Palestine.\u201d Anyone who claims to want a future of peace and liberation must first be willing to confront the rot within their own movement.\nTo those who say they are anti-Zionist but not antisemitic, I say: Start proving it. Show us that you care about Jewish safety, not just Palestinian sovereignty. Show us that your solidarity is based in love, not in scapegoating. Show us that when Jews are threatened, you\u2019ll light a candle and take a stand\u2014not just offer a shrug and say, \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d\nBecause what\u2019s happening now is not complicated.\nHamas is a terror organization.\nAntisemitism is rising at historic levels.\nJews are being threatened, doxxed, beaten, and murdered\u2014not for what we believe, but for who we are.\nTo my neighbors, elected officials, and fellow Mainers: I am asking you to stop being afraid of nuance and start being brave about truth. Speak out when Jewish institutions are attacked. Condemn hate groups when they show up in our streets. Learn the history of antisemitism in our state before deciding who is powerful and who is vulnerable.\nTo those who look to me for leadership in this moment: I promise I will not look away. I will keep naming what I see. I will keep making space for grief and for hope. I will keep showing up for peace and for Jewish dignity.\nI am a Jew by choice. And I am choosing, again and again, to live out the values of my people: to repair what is broken, to love without flinching, and to say what must be said\u2014all in the name of Am Yisrael."}

It is the Israeli national holiday, celebrating the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967, during the Six Day War. \nMy childhood memories of this day are soft, sweet and fuzzy. Me in pigtails, wearing a white shirt and a knee length, polyester navy skirt.  My mother sewed matching jumpers for me and my two sisters, with little pockets and a white ribbon decoration.\nYom Yerushalayim 1978\nAs I remember the day, perhaps naively, Jerusalem Day was more spiritual and calm than the Day of Independence, with its stages for musical performers in the street, plastic hammers and foam spray.  On Yom Yerushalayim we celebrated a city that was sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, a city that aspired to become a light unto the nations and embody tolerance within a multi-ethnic, multi-racial urban space. In our minds, the Jews and Arabs in Jerusalem exemplified the possibility of coexistence. \nI realize this was a child\u2019s view, of one oblivious to some of the complexities. Jerusalem was always racially segregated and East Jerusalem Palestinians weren\u2019t then, and still are not now, full citizens of Israel. Nevertheless, during my childhood and youth, we celebrated a vision of Jerusalem as a center for tolerance, equal rights and religious coexistence. \nLast Tuesday, I watched in horror a different celebration of Jerusalem Day. My social media feed was full of images of teens, still wearing blue and white, marching through the Muslim Quarter on their way to the Kotel. But these teens were not celebrating a \u201cunification\u201d of Jerusalem. Rather, they were celebrating conquest, domination and Jewish supremacy.\n\u201cMay your village burn\nAt first sight, and with the sound turned off, the marchers seemed wholesome. Groups of boys were dancing and singing, followed by groups of girls. But when you turned up the volume, the scene felt more like a KKK march or a medieval pogrom. \u201cMay your village burn\u201d is one popular song, \u201cDeath to the Arabs\u201d another. The marchers sing \u201cThere is no school in Gaza because there are no children left,\u201d celebrating the killing of children, while people are starving in Gaza.  A large banner reads \u201c67 \u2013 Jerusalem is in our hands, 2025 \u2013 Gaza is in our hands,\u201d explicitly calling for Israel to conquer the territory. \nUpper Banner: \u201cJerusalem in our hand \u2013 67 Gaza in our hands \u2013 2025\u201d Lower banner \u201cWithout a Nakkbah \u2013 No Victory\u201d\nThe crowd became more like a mob as it entered the Old City Shuk. The stores were shuttered, the streets empty. A group of boys accosted two Muslim women, and another one spat on an elderly Palestinian man. Anticipating the vandalism, a store owner protected his ATM with a cardboard sign that read \u201cBelongs to a Jew. Please don\u2019t destroy.\u201d\nRabbis, educators, and leaders of the \u201cDati Leumi\u201d (National Religious) community claim every year that only a few \u201cbad apples\u201d are involved in the vandalism and that songs are harmless. The celebrity reaction to Ben Gvir and the repeated settler violence in the West Bank suggest otherwise.\nJune 4 Settler Violence Dir Dibwan\nSince the election of the current far-right Israeli government, I have been wondering if I still share a value system with this community that embraces ultra-nationalism, racist and vengeful rhetoric . Can our synagogues, day schools, and summer camps be part of the same broad religious affiliation as people who joyfully sing \u201cDeath to the Arabs\u201d? Can this attitude be changed, or do we need to define ourselves as a distinct, new, Jewish denomination? \nOur Jewish textual heritage is expansive, and we draw upon ideas that support our theological and spiritual commitments. I aspire to follow the Talmudic saying that calls upon us to emulate the Divine by imitating God: \u201cJust as He is compassionate and merciful, so too you should be compassionate and merciful\u201d (Shabbat 133b), a teaching that is quoted in Maimonides\u2019 Mishneh Torah (Human Dispositions 1:6), Mesilat Yesharim (Introduction 34), to list just a few sources. I believe all people are created in God\u2019s image and that human life has infinite value. I believe in a multicultural, multiracial world, reflecting the multiplicity of God\u2019s creation. I believe God is the sovereign of the land, and we are God\u2019s humble stewards. I believe our history as a minority obliges us to treat the minorities within our midst with dignity and humility.    \nI realize these values are not universally shared in the Orthodox community. I wonder what defines the boundaries of my own affiliation? Who do I pray with? What institutions do I trust to educate my children? \nThe existing denominational landscape emerged in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when the Reform movement chose to emphasize ethical, humanistic values while Orthodoxy reaffirmed its commitment to Halacha\u2013the observance of  Jewish rituals such as Shabbat and the dietary restrictions. Earlier, in the eighteenth century, Hasidim and Mitnagdim split, originally refusing to pray together or marry one another. Both movements created innovative versions of Jewish Orthodoxy. Hasidim put prayer, joy, and the Rebbe at the center of worship, while Mitnagdim created the modern Yeshiva as the focal point for an intellectually oriented form of Jewish spirituality. \nHave we arrived at a similar fork in the road, one in which compassionate Judaism parts ways with vengeful, racist Judaism? I don\u2019t know, but I am excited about the emergence of the Smol Emuni movement in Israel and the US, a movement that perhaps can shift the tide if that is still possible.\nHaSmol HaEmuni\u2013which means \u201cThe Faithful Left\u201d in Hebrew\u2013was started in Israel in 2023 by a diverse group of anti-occupation religious activists, aspiring to live a life of faith, humility, and compassion. In the United States, a similar group, called Smol Emuni US,  held a successful conference in March. It opened with an inspiring video address by Rabbi Yosef Blau, who lamented the obsession with power of the Religious Zionist movement. In that room, we could love Israel and also feel horrified by its war in Gaza. It reminded me of my childhood vision of Jerusalem, a city of shared spirituality and respect. \nThe lyrics of one of the popular songs at the Yom Yerushalayim march are taken from Judges 16:28. After he is blinded by the Philistines, Samson calls out to God and asks \u201cPlease remember me, and give me strength just this once, O God, to take revenge on the Philistines, if only for one of my two eyes.\u201d When the marchers sing, they scream the line \u201cto take revenge on the Philistines,\u201d a call for vengeance that plays on the similar sound of the biblical Philistines and the contemporary Palestinians. \nBut Samson\u2019s vow for revenge is a suicide mission. As you may recall, with his immense strength, Samson topples the palace in which he is incarcerated, killing himself along with his enemies. The kids may not realize it, but as the verse reveals, the cost of vengeance is self destruction\u2013it destroys both sides. \nAfter this Yom Yerushalayim, I wonder if a compassionate Jewish voice can shift the tone of the Dati Leumi community or if the time has come to publicly distance ourselves from religious vengeance and racism proclaimed in the name of God?"}

The article remained online and unedited even after the IDF released videos of Hamas terrorists gunning down Palestinian civilians waiting in line for food aid.\nThe New York Times report was even more damning. \u201cIsraeli Soldiers Open Fire Near Gaza Aid Site. Gaza Officials Say 27 Are Killed,\u201d it claimed. Witnesses reported Israeli soldiers fired on people trying to collect aid, and Israel denied it. Again, there was no correction after the IDF posted the incriminating videos.\nI asked the most senior and knowledgeable sources in the IDF whether there was any truth to the media\u2019s claims. The answer was an unequivocal \u201cno.\u201d Israeli troops never once opened fire on Palestinians seeking aid.\nThe media\u2019s message is, simply, that Jews are an inherently bloodthirsty people who enjoy slaughtering innocent people. CNN and The Times both routinely quote the Gaza Health Authorities, though neither can identify who, outside of Hamas, those authorities might be. They regularly repeat the statistic that Israel has killed 54,000 Palestinians without noting the 22,000 terrorists killed by Israel or the estimated 8,000 Palestinians who, since 10/7/23, have died of natural causes, or the thousands of Palestinians killed by short-falling Hamas rockets or by Hamas executioners. Even if the 54,000 is accurate\u2014and serious studies have shown that it is grossly distorted\u2014deducting all those other numbers yields the lowest civilian to combatant fatality rate in modern military history.\nOf course, every civilian death is a tragedy, but neither CNN nor The New York Times considers collateral damage an inevitable byproduct of war, especially one in which terrorists wear civilian clothes, employ child soldiers, and hide both behind and under civilians in hospitals, mosques, schools, and tunnels. Instead of a tragic byproduct, collateral damage is implicitly portrayed by mainstream outlets as the goal of Israel\u2019s war.\nWhen it comes to Israel, the mainstream media is not in the business of reporting reality. Their business, rather, is blood libel.\nHow macabre it was, then, to watch CNN\u2019s coverage of the firebomb attack on mostly elderly Jews in Boulder, Colorado, by a deranged antisemite shouting \u201cend Zionists!\u201d The reportage was brimming with sympathy for the victims, indignation, and outrage at the second violent attack against American Jews on US soil in less than two weeks. \u201cSuch acts of blatant hatred simply must stop,\u201d was the newsroom\u2019s message.\nNot once, not even obliquely, did the reporters and anchors pause to consider what role they and other self-declared middle-of-the-road journalists play in creating an atmosphere of Jew hatred. After all, if their audiences are being told hour after hour how Jews are blithely butchering women and children, why wouldn\u2019t some of those viewers seek justice in shooting and incinerating some of those wicked Jews? Why wouldn\u2019t Cody Balmer believe that by burning Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro and his family alive in their beds, he could get Israel \u201cto stop killing my friends?\u201d Why wouldn\u2019t Elias Rodriguez, the murderer of Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky in Washington, or Boulder\u2019s would-be assassin Mohamed Sabry Soliman, not assume that it\u2019s open season on Jews?\nOf course, not all the blame can be placed on CNN or The New York Times, but neither can they remain guiltless. When was the last time either of them held Hamas, rather than Israel, primarily responsible for Gaza\u2019s suffering? When, if ever, did the mainstream media seriously consider the ramifications of Hamas declaring victory in this war, reasserting its rule over Gaza, plotting the next October 7, and providing a fillip to jihadists throughout the West?\nOne can only conclude that the media\u2019s need to portray the Jews as coveters of innocent blood overrides their commitment to even the most basic journalistic norms. Their determination to demonize Israel\u2014while lionizing the Palestinians\u2014takes precedence over their responsibility to make the United States safe for the American Jews marching for the hostages\u2019 freedom.\nThis article was originally published in Michael Oren\u2019s Substack, Clarity with Michael Oren."}

Genocide is not a word that should be used loosely or casually, as it has so disturbingly (wrongly) been employed regarding the conflict in Gaza. The same is true regarding South Africa, and indeed any situation around the world that, no matter how tragic they may be, cannot be equated to genocide.\nNo one disputes that South Africa has a shockingly high murder rate, including in rural areas, and among farmers, women, and youth who have experienced brutality and trauma that can never be denied. Neither can it be denied that the current government, like its predecessors going right back going back decades, have, to date, clearly failed to take effective steps to address the scourge. For this, they deserve to be criticized, and harshly. Yet there is a crucial difference between being charged with negligence, incompetence, or outright dereliction of duty on the one hand and of being complicit in genocide on the other. As Jews, we cannot diminish or manipulate the meaning of the word genocide. It demonstrates a lack of respect for what victims of real genocide have suffered, whether during the Holocaust or in other instances of targeted mass murder that have taken place both before and since, including on our own continent.\n Usage of the term \u201cgenocide\u201d with regard to the South African scenario is simply not accurate. No matter how horrific the country\u2019s violent crime rate might be, characterizing it as such ultimately cheapens and belittles what genocide is really about. That is, not random, opportunistic killings by criminal individuals, but a planned, coordinated, systematic annihilation of an identifiable, and specifically identified sector of humanity.\n As the UN Convention clearly states, genocide is based on intent. Specifically, that intent to destroy in \u201cwhole or in part a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group.\u201d In addition to killing members of the group outright, its articles include causing serious bodily or mental harm, creating conditions calculated to bring about the group\u2019s physical destruction, preventing births, and transferring children.\nIn the case of the Holocaust, the intention of the Nazi perpetrators was to hunt down and kill every single Jew they could, with the ultimate, and explicit aim of rendering the world completely Judenrein \u2013 Jew-free. No exceptions were allowed \u2013 just to have been born Jewish amounted to a death sentence. Earlier this year, we attended the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, where we saw firsthand the concentration camps and death camps where Jewish and other people were callously herded through the gates to their deaths in the gas chambers. This is what true genocide looks like.\nIt is disrespectful, even callous to the victims when such horrors are casually likened to situations that in reality bear no comparison to what they endured \u2014 and no leader should manipulate the tragedy of Jewish history to score cheap political points. The South African Jewish Board of Deputies and South African Holocaust Museums and Memorials globally have consistently and unstintingly worked to ensure that the memory of the Holocaust is not misappropriated as an adjective to describe other painful situations.\nMost certainly, the terrible scourge of violent crime in our country is something we must acknowledge. Every life is precious and we condemn this terrible situation. But we must name it properly. It is crime, not a deliberate, organized mass killing campaign. The responsibility for dealing with this lies in the first instance with those charged with ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of the citizens who elected them in the first place. When they fail in this fundamental duty, it is indeed appropriate that they be called to account for it. However, levelling inaccurate and emotionally charged accusations of genocide is not the way to go about this. They are not useful and do not lead to solutions.\nAt this time, when there is so much hurt in the world, those in positions of leadership need to choose their words carefully. Innocent South Africans are suffering, from crime, poverty, gender-based violence and so much more. Israelis and Gazans are suffering in a devastating war. We need to be part of the solution by engaging rationally and respectfully on these issues, in ways that are productive and functional. We must take care not to engage in emotionally driven denunciations that obfuscate the real issues and divide rather than unite.\n\u2014\nThe above was co-authored by Professor Karen Milner, an academic at Wits University since 1993, where she earned her BA with honors, her MA, and her PhD.

As in past years, I will be there with Free Parent Hugs, an organization of volunteers who bring parental warmth and nurturing to the event. We hand out home-baked cookies and nudge participants to put on sunscreen and stay hydrated. As the name suggests, we also give out lots of hugs.\nI get some curious looks when I attend Pride. Although there are more and more visibly-religious participants each year, we are still the minority. With my headscarf and black dress, I look more like the people on the other side of the police barricade: religious Jewish demonstrators who oppose any public acknowledgment of the LGBTQ community in Jerusalem, and protest the fact that this march is happening at all.\nI wasn\u2019t always Orthodox. I grew up in a liberal Jewish community, where I was raised with an affirming attitude toward gay and bisexual people. Homophobia was ever-present in the mainstream American culture of the 1990s, but it was something to be resisted and challenged, like racism and antisemitism. In my worldview, speaking up for tolerance and understanding was an obvious imperative.\nAt 18, I fell in love with Torah and with the discipline of religious life. I attended seminaries for the newly-religious, where I sat through classes on Orthodox values and beliefs. I mostly liked these sessions, with one glaring exception. Whenever the topic of the Torah\u2019s position on homosexuality came up, I couldn\u2019t engage. Any discussion of the issue filled me with furious despair. \nI had come to understand the Torah as a God-given corpus, eternal and binding in its particulars. At the same time, prohibitions on homosexuality contradicted something equally true and just within me. My teachers offered smug platitudes and bizarre metaphors (I\u2019ll spare you the pain of articulating them), and I could not find peace. I wanted to be religious, but I could not rationalize or contextualize the Torah\u2019s demands in a way that felt satisfying.\nSo I stopped trying. I set the matter aside and let it remain unresolved. I had the luxury of doing this because it didn\u2019t affect me personally. Or so I thought.\nI continued on my journey toward halachic observance and ideological transformation. I met and married my husband. I became a kallah-instructor (pre-marriage counselor, for Orthodox women) and then a sex educator. I moved to Israel with my growing family and became increasingly politically active. I immersed myself in Torah study, in teaching and writing. The conflict remained unsettled, a sore spot deep within, and one that I avoided at all costs. \nIn 2015, 16-year-old Shira Banki was stabbed to death at the Jerusalem Pride Parade. The deranged extremist who took her life was a self-identified Orthodox Jew. In the wake of Shira\u2019s murder, people of all religious persuasions gathered in Jerusalem\u2019s Zion Square on a Saturday evening to hear speeches and participate in dialogue circles.\nThat evening, Rabbi Benny Lau spoke words that changed me forever. I am grateful that the Eshel organization published a translation of his speech, which I revisit frequently. I will share some of the remarks that affected me so profoundly. I encourage everyone to read the speech in full, which can be found here, in the original Hebrew. \nRabbi Lau decried Shira\u2019s murder, as well as two crimes by Jews against Palestinian victims around that time: the kidnapping and murder of 16-year-old Mohammed Abu Khdeir, and the arson death of baby Ali Dawabsheh and his parents. Rabbi Lau did not reserve condemnation only for their murderers. He implicated all of us.\nIt is not possible to say \u2018our hands did not spill this blood.\u2019 Anyone who ever sat at a Shabbat table, in a school classroom, in a synagogue, on a soccer field, at a club or community center, who heard those racist jokes, who heard those homophobic jokes, who heard the crude language and did not stand up to stop it, they are an accomplice to this bloodshed.\nI knew Rabbi Lau was right. I had been content to stay silent when I heard dehumanizing statements about gay people, about Arabs. I didn\u2019t laugh at offensive jokes, but I didn\u2019t challenge people who made them. \nEveryone has their own reasons for failing to speak up. I dislike confrontation and disharmony in general. I didn\u2019t want to create awkwardness and discord. \nWhen it came to homophobia, however, there was another reason. I was still confused. The old dissonance remained within me, the sense that I couldn\u2019t reconcile the Torah\u2019s prohibitions with my own sense of what was right and true.\nSo I didn\u2019t speak up when I encountered homophobic speech in my community. I just let it happen around me, over and over again. I was complicit, and standing there in Zion Square, I felt profound shame. I was filled with a desire to change, and I took my direction from Rabbi Lau\u2019s words:\nWe must create waves and waves of love. We need to release people from fear. We need to stand with our faces exposed. Without hesitating, and without stammering, if our ears hear someone\u2014and it doesn\u2019t matter if they are a rabbi or educator, or counselor or parent. If we hear the slightest sound that can hurt, we must stop them in the first moment. The fire begins there\u2014it begins with the first insult, with the small racial slur\u2014and not in the big inferno.\nSince that night, I have tried to speak up for my values, to risk confrontation. I\u2019m no longer willing to allow hatred to grow unchallenged. And each year since, I have tried to honor Shira Banki\u2019s life, and Rabbi Lau\u2019s clarion call, by participating in the annual Jerusalem Pride March. \nWalking a spiritual path means seeking awareness of what is being asked of me, specifically and personally, in each moment. Perhaps my friends in the LGBTQ community who strive to fulfill the Torah with integrity might need to negotiate the paradox I have described. That is not my personal challenge. I didn\u2019t create this tension, and I won\u2019t be the one to resolve it. When I accept this, I can focus on what is actually within my power: to create the waves of love that Rabbi Lau described. \nSo let me not stammer or hesitate: I love you. I stand with you, this month and forever. When you need a hug from a sister, I will be your sister. If you are longing for a mother to love you, to see your beauty and accept you exactly as you are, I will be your mother. And if you feel you can\u2019t be your full self and live all of your values in your community right now, we will build community together.\n\u2014\nI hope you will join me at the Jerusalem Pride and Tolerance March this Thursday, June 5. If you spot the Free Parent Hugs table, stop by and say hi. Wishing everyone a blessed and meaningful Pride Month."}

For many men and women, the ongoing war has intensified the yearning for connection, relationship, and love. But the very conditions of war \u2014 stress, trauma, and instability \u2014 have made it harder than ever to build the bonds that lead to lasting partnerships.\nIn a country where every loss is felt as a collective wound, the act of building a relationship \u2014 of creating a new home \u2014 becomes more than a personal endeavor. It becomes an act of national healing.\nOver the past months, I\u2019ve received calls from countless concerned parents, friends, and community members echoing the same stories: women hesitant to date men recently called to service (or those who may be called again); soldiers breaking off relationships because of their experiences in combat; relationships collapsing under the weight of trauma; and soldiers returning home emotionally overwhelmed, unable to even consider dating. While some are propelled by a deep desire to forge meaningful bonds amidst the chaos, many fledgling relationships have simply unraveled \u2014 casualties of emotional overload, shifting schedules, and an ongoing sense of uncertainty.\nPerhaps the most significant hurdle I\u2019m seeing is the psychological leap from survival mode to intimacy. Everyone \u2014 whether on the front lines or at home navigating red alerts and disrupted routines \u2014 is carrying an unnatural level of tension. Trauma-related issues are taking an increasing toll.  For many who are not in long-term relationships, a painful paradox is at play: just when the desire for love is strongest, the emotional resources to pursue it are depleted. Hearts, in a constant state of alert, struggle to open. Vulnerability feels dangerous. Even going on a date feels like a risk.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. Even married couples are reporting strains \u2014 distance, anxiety, estrangement, even divorce. But for singles, the isolation may run deeper. Anxiety hangs in the air like background noise, draining the bandwidth needed to nurture something new. Many are quietly asking themselves: Can I start a relationship? Is it responsible? Is it fair?\nAnd then there\u2019s a rising, heartbreaking refrain from women: \u201cThe men have disappeared.\u201d Some have fallen in battle. Others are injured. Many more are simply unreachable \u2014 emotionally shut down, consumed by the aftershocks of battle, or burdened by the weight of survival. Their absence is more than physical; it\u2019s emotional, societal \u2014 and deeply felt.\nThe war has also shifted the dynamics of the dating world. Combat soldiers are often elevated to hero status \u2014 rightfully admired, yet also placed on a pedestal that leaves others, who contribute in quieter, but no less essential ways, overlooked. Educators, medics, logistics professionals, volunteers, even non-combat soldiers \u2014 all part of the national effort \u2014 may find themselves sidelined. This creates a quiet hierarchy that adds to the emotional toll.\nThen there is the social disparity that too often goes unspoken. Families of reservists are embraced by the community \u2014 with meals, visits, concern. But the single reservists who don\u2019t have families? No one brings them food. No one checks in. They become invisible, carrying a form of loneliness that cuts especially deep in times of national trauma.\nAt The Eden Center, the nonprofit I lead, we see relationship-building as part of national resilience. We believe that creating strong, healthy, stable homes is a form of resistance \u2014 a declaration of continuity in the face of destruction. Choosing love amidst grief is an act of defiance against despair.\nThe longing for love is not a luxury; it is human. And building relationships is not just the responsibility of singles. It is a collective mission. We all have a role to play: friends, families, matchmakers, neighbors. Whether you extend a warm dinner invitation, suggest a thoughtful introduction, or simply offer an open heart and a listening ear \u2014 each gesture matters. Each act of care can become an anchor.\nIf we truly listen \u2014 if we dare to acknowledge both the pain and the potential of those who are seeking relationships in our communities \u2014 we may just begin to heal some of the deeper wounds this war has opened.\nLet\u2019s build a society where no one feels alone in their longing. Where love, even in wartime, finds a way home.\n\u2014\nBecome part of the conversation \u2014 to validate these struggles, and to find new ways to support those searching for connection in this difficult time. The Eden Center is bringing together mental health experts, community leaders, educators, and singles. Together, we can help ensure that every soul feels seen and supported. Join us for our upcoming conference on \u201cDating and Relationships in the Wake of War,\u201d on Tuesday, June 10th 17:00-21:30 at the Nefesh B\u2019Nefesh Campus in Cinema City, Jerusalem.\nRegister at https://tickchak.co.il/82224"}

School trips to October 7 sites", "date": "JUN 4, 2025, 12:59 PM", "media_type": "blog", "link": null, "content": "My daughter\u2019s high school is organizing a trip to one of the communities affected by the October 7 massacre. The invitation arrived in a school-wide email, framed in the language of solidarity, remembrance, and national identity. The students are expected to bear witness to what happened there.\nAnd I don\u2019t know if I want her to go.\nThis is not because I question the need to remember. On the contrary, remembrance is central to how we process collective trauma. But when the loss is still recent and its meaning still unsettled, how should we approach it? When does remembrance help, and when might it cross into something else?\nAcross the world, school trips to sites of national tragedy are meant to educate, build empathy, and connect students to a shared history. In Israel, this often includes visits to Holocaust museums, battle sites, or cemeteries. But what does it mean when the event being commemorated occurred recently? When the emotional dimensions are unresolved, how should we guide students through the experience?\nThe term \u201ctrauma tourism\u201d is often used to describe visits to sites of atrocity that risk turning suffering into spectacle. The term usually applies to foreign visitors. But in this case, we are speaking of young Israelis, many of whom already carry psychological weight from recent events. Does that make the visit more urgent \u2014 or more fraught?\nThe key concern is not the trip itself, but the context and intention. Will the experience help students process the weight of what happened, or will it ask them to engage with something whose meaning is still too raw to be fully grasped? Will they be encouraged to engage thoughtfully and reflectively, with the emotional support and context such visits require?\nThere is no single right answer. Some parents will see this trip as a vital act of witness. Others may worry it asks too much of students too soon. Some may wonder whether such visits allow space for emotional processing, or if they risk appropriating a past that is not yet past. Others will find meaning in standing on the very ground where tragedy occurred.\nWhat matters is that we ask these questions, openly and without judgment. Teachers and school leaders have a dual responsibility: to shape memory with care, and to support the moral and emotional development of their students. Preparing young people to encounter trauma requires more than logistics. It requires a framework. Students need space to process what they see. They need permission to ask difficult questions. They need guidance that encourages reflection, not just reaction.\nThis moment calls for thoughtful education, with careful attention to timing and sensitivity. When does commemoration serve healing, and when does it risk deepening fear? When are students ready to carry this weight, and how can we help them do so in a way that supports resilience rather than trauma?\nThese questions may not have simple answers, but they deserve careful thought. As educators and parents, we play a role in how memory is introduced and interpreted. Recent events carry real weight, and how we approach them requires patience and care.\nThe way we remember matters. So does the timing. What we choose to highlight, and when, will help determine how future generations understand this moment."}
