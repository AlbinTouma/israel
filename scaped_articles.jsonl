In all cases, residents cannot apply directly to COGAT; an international organization must submit the request on their behalf.\nIt is notable that many countries accepting patients from Gaza during the war, including the UAE and various European states, have clarified that these are temporary stays for medical treatment and that the individuals are expected to return afterward.\nRelated: Almost half of Gaza Palestinians willing to ask Israel to help them leave — poll\nSince the war began, the World Health Organization has been responsible for coordinating the evacuation of patients and their companions from the Gaza Strip.

Gazan residents cannot request exit permits from Israel directly.\nWhen the Rafah crossing was open from November 2023 to May 2024, foreign nationals used it to reach Egypt. Most were asked to pay between $2,000 and $5,000 per person to Egyptian companies managing the crossing.\nNotably, even Gazans without foreign citizenship were able to leave by paying the same amount, including senior Hamas figures such as the Hamas-run health ministry spokesperson, Ashraf al-Qudra, who reportedly exited the Strip this way during the war.\nA Palestinian stranded in Egypt waits to cross Rafah crossing to the Gaza Strip at Rafah, Egypt, after a temporary truce came into effect, November 27, 2023.

He requested that his full name and identifying details not be published.\nIn September 2023, Ahmad traveled to Gaza for a family visit. Once the war broke out, he attempted to leave and return home. His first attempt via Rafah was denied by Israel on the grounds of “security concerns.” Later, with legal assistance from Gisha, he petitioned Israel’s High Court of Justice to leave. Israel responded after long months that it had no objection to his departure, and a week after the petition was withdrawn, his exit via Kerem Shalom crossing was coordinated.\nAhmad left Gaza after 15 months of trying, despite holding foreign citizenship and having immediate family abroad.\nIn a WhatsApp conversation with The Times of Israel, Ahmad described the experience as deeply frustrating: “Throughout the process, the official bodies responsible for handling this had failed. The citizen is the last priority.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nGazans leave following requests by foreign governments\nDespite official Israeli statements asserting that only foreign nationals or individuals in need of urgent medical care are allowed to exit Gaza, approximately 290 Gaza residents have left the Strip since the March collapse of the ceasefire. According to foreign media reports, official statements, and a source familiar with the issue who spoke with The Times of Israel, they left through foreign government intervention and not for medical reasons, and some of them did not have foreign citizenship.\nAlthough COGAT told The Times of Israel that the only valid exit criteria are illness, injury, or foreign citizenship, several Gazans have traveled to Europe over the past two months without meeting these conditions. For example, 13 students left for Ireland on student visas, and several individuals traveled to France, including Gazans who had worked for French institutions in Gaza, their relatives, academics granted scholarships, and students with study visas.\nWhen The Times of Israel asked which documents were required for these exits to be approved, the embassies of Ireland and France in Israel declined to respond. However, the French embassy confirmed that it had worked for several months to secure the departure of those Gaza residents.\nAmong them were the 13 students accepted to academic institutions in Ireland, along with family members of Irish citizens. The Irish embassy in Israel declined to specify the total number of evacuees. One Irish newspaper reported that among them was a 74-year-old woman, the mother of an Irish citizen, who had waited 18 months to leave Gaza.\nPalestinians flee Beit Lahiya, in the northern Gaza Strip, March 25, 2025.

The Canadian and British embassies in Israel did not respond to inquiries regarding the exact number of people evacuated.\nExcept for one instance — a March 31 flight that took 33 German nationals and their relatives directly to Germany — all others were transferred from the Kerem Shalom crossing through Israel to Jordan by vehicle and then flown onward to Europe.\nMany of these individuals had reportedly been trying to leave Gaza for months, some since the start of the war. Following the March 31 evacuation to Germany, German officials acknowledged: “We would have preferred to do this sooner — it took us time.”\nIn total, at least 284 people are confirmed to have left Gaza for foreign destinations. The exact number is unknown, but given the significant restrictions imposed by foreign governments and Israel, it is unlikely to be much higher.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross helped coordinate the exit of these residents and foreign nationals through the Kerem Shalom crossing.

COGAT has stated that acceptance to academic programs overseas does not meet the criteria for exit.\nShai Greenberg, spokesperson for Gisha, told The Times of Israel: “Since the beginning of the war, thousands of people have been trapped in the Gaza Strip — including foreign nationals, patients in need of life-saving medical treatment unavailable in Gaza, students accepted into graduate programs abroad, and individuals eligible for family reunification in various countries.\n“This is part of a systematic violation of fundamental rights — including freedom of movement and the right to family life for both those trapped and their relatives in Gaza and abroad — as well as the rights to health, bodily integrity, education, and livelihood,” Greenberg stated.\nAhmad, who left Gaza in February after 15 months of effort, told The Times of Israel he knows many foreign nationals who remain stuck in the Strip.\n“I know a lot of people with foreign citizenship or permanent residency abroad who are still trapped in Gaza — some of them are close friends. Only one of them managed to leave, about 20 days ago,” he said.\nPalestinians in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, hold anti-war signs as a man chants slogans in support of the people of Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, who have been protesting against Hamas, March 26, 2025.

His first attempt via Rafah was denied by Israel on the grounds of “security concerns.” Later, with legal assistance from Gisha, he petitioned Israel’s High Court of Justice to leave. Israel responded after long months that it had no objection to his departure, and a week after the petition was withdrawn, his exit via Kerem Shalom crossing was coordinated.\nAhmad left Gaza after 15 months of trying, despite holding foreign citizenship and having immediate family abroad.\nIn a WhatsApp conversation with The Times of Israel, Ahmad described the experience as deeply frustrating: “Throughout the process, the official bodies responsible for handling this had failed. The citizen is the last priority.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nGazans leave following requests by foreign governments\nDespite official Israeli statements asserting that only foreign nationals or individuals in need of urgent medical care are allowed to exit Gaza, approximately 290 Gaza residents have left the Strip since the March collapse of the ceasefire. According to foreign media reports, official statements, and a source familiar with the issue who spoke with The Times of Israel, they left through foreign government intervention and not for medical reasons, and some of them did not have foreign citizenship.\nAlthough COGAT told The Times of Israel that the only valid exit criteria are illness, injury, or foreign citizenship, several Gazans have traveled to Europe over the past two months without meeting these conditions. For example, 13 students left for Ireland on student visas, and several individuals traveled to France, including Gazans who had worked for French institutions in Gaza, their relatives, academics granted scholarships, and students with study visas.\nWhen The Times of Israel asked which documents were required for these exits to be approved, the embassies of Ireland and France in Israel declined to respond. However, the French embassy confirmed that it had worked for several months to secure the departure of those Gaza residents.\nAmong them were the 13 students accepted to academic institutions in Ireland, along with family members of Irish citizens. The Irish embassy in Israel declined to specify the total number of evacuees.

{"title": "Trump no longer demanding Saudis recognize Israel for nuclear deal with US — sources", "content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — The United States is no longer demanding Saudi Arabia normalize ties with Israel as a condition for progress on civil nuclear cooperation talks, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters ahead of US President Donald Trump’s visit to Riyadh next week.\nDropping the demand that Saudi Arabia establish diplomatic relations with Israel would be a major concession by Washington. Under former US president Joe Biden, nuclear talks were an element of a wider US-Saudi deal tied to normalization and Riyadh’s goal of a defense treaty with Washington.\nThe kingdom has repeatedly said it would not recognize Israel without a guarantee of a viable path to a Palestinian state, frustrating Biden administration attempts to expand the Abraham Accords signed during Trump’s first term. Under those accords, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco normalized relations with Israel. Progress toward Saudi recognition of Israel has been halted by fury in Arab countries over the war raging in Gaza. The nuclear talks had also stumbled over Washington’s non-proliferation concerns.\nIn a possible sign of a new approach, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that Saudi Arabia and the United States were on a “pathway” to a civil nuclear agreement when he visited the kingdom in April.\n“When we have something to announce, you will hear it from the President. Any reports on this are speculative,” US National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt told Reuters in response to a request for comment.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nSaudi Arabia’s government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nUS Senator Lindsay Graham, a staunch Trump supporter, wrote on X in response to the report that he opposes any US-Saudi defense agreement that does not include Riyadh normalizing relations with Jerusalem.\nEven without the normalization requirement for civil nuclear talks to progress, and despite unpacking the issue from a wider defense treaty, a deal is not yet in close reach, one of the sources said.\nOne sticking point is Section 123 of the US Atomic Energy Act that allows cooperation with other countries developing civil nuclear capabilities but specifies nonproliferation criteria, including limiting uranium enrichment.\nSaudi Arabia’s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, has said that the kingdom would seek to enrich uranium and sell the product.\nOne of the sources said the kingdom was still not willing to sign a so-called 123 agreement, which would prevent enrichment or reprocessing of plutonium made in reactors — two routes that have the potential to culminate in nuclear weapons.\nSecretary Wright previously told Reuters that a 123 agreement would be a prerequisite to any deal.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, there are several ways to structure a deal to achieve both countries’ objectives, Wright has said.\nOne solution being discussed is a “black box” arrangement where only US personnel would have access to a uranium enrichment facility on Saudi soil, the same source said.\nSaudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman meets with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the Royal Palace grounds in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, March 10, 2025. (SAUL LOEB / POOL / AFP)\nUS official’s warning\nOn Wednesday, Israel’s Channel 12 reported that in a meeting Tuesday night with families of the hostages, a senior member of the American negotiating team had criticized Israel for failing to take advantage of the emerging agreement with Saudi Arabia.\n“If Israel doesn’t come to its senses, the price of missing out will be higher than ever before,” the official warned.\nThe official cautioned that Trump would no longer wait for Israel and was determined to move forward with the strategic agreement. It wasn’t clear what the official was expecting Israel to do.\n“The ceasefire agreement with the Houthis is just a prelude, and if Israel doesn’t wake up, the ‘Deal of the Millennium’ will also be finalized without it,” the official reportedly said, adding that “We hope Israel will get on board this historic train that’s already left the station.”\nThe official’s warning of a weakening alliance between Israel and the US greatly worried the families of the hostages, said the report, as US mediators play a major role in the ongoing negotiations to reach a hostage-ceasefire deal that could potentially set their loved ones free.\nSell more oil\nRiyadh wants to build nuclear generation capacity because it seeks to diversify its economy away from oil. Nuclear power could also help free up more crude barrels for export.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArms control advocates have previously expressed concern about a Saudi nuclear program because de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said the kingdom would seek to quickly develop nuclear weapons should its regional rival Iran do so.\nThe US and Iran are currently holding talks over Tehran’s nuclear program, which Washington and Western allies say is geared toward producing weapons. Iran insists it is purely for civil purposes. However, the Islamic Republic has enriched uranium to levels only necessary for military purposes and has called for the destruction of Israel since its founding.\nUS Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday described the talks with Iran as “so far, so good” and said there was a deal to be made that would reintegrate Iran into the global economy while preventing it from getting a nuclear weapon.\nSaudi Arabia and the United States are set to discuss a number of blockbuster economic deals during Trump’s visit next week, with the US poised to offer Saudi Arabia an arms package worth well over $100 billion, sources have told Reuters.\nTrump has said Riyadh should “round up” a planned investment package in the US to $1 trillion from an initial $600 billion.\nThe trip is Trump’s second visit abroad, after a short trip to Rome for the pope’s funeral, since he returned to office in January. In his first term, a lavish trip to Saudi Arabia marked his first overseas stop.\nTrump fostered close ties with Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, during his first term.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe country invested $2 billion in a firm formed by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and former aide, after Trump left office, and there are plans to build two Trump towers in Jeddah and Riyadh.\nNava Freiberg contributed to this report.", "date": "8 May 2025, 8:56 pm", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-no-longer-demanding-saudis-recognize-israel-for-nuclear-deal-with-us-sources/", "type": "article"}

(Photo by Alex HALADA / AFP)\nIn January, it said it would enrich uranium — a process that can also be used as part of a military program — to create ‘yellowcake’ fuel for nuclear power generation that it could sell.\nAny deal with Washington would likely address safeguards to assuage worries about military ambitions, on top of Saudi Arabia’s existing commitment not to pursue a bomb under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhat’s in it for the United States?\nThere could be strategic and commercial gains.\nCivil nuclear cooperation was an important inducement along with security guarantees in an effort by Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden to broker a deal for Saudi Arabia and Israel to normalize relations.\nHowever, those two issues are now uncoupled, Reuters has reported, though a nuclear deal could be a sweetener in US diplomatic efforts with the kingdom. Riyadh has ruled out normalizing ties with Israel without Palestinian statehood.\nUS Energy Secretary Chris Wright met Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman in April and said the two countries were on “a pathway” to a civil nuclear agreement.

(AP Photo/Andy Wong)\nState-owned China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC) reportedly submitted a bid in 2023 to construct a nuclear plant. Russia’s state nuclear firm Rosatom, which built a nuclear plant in Egypt, has also signed preliminary cooperation agreements with Riyadh. Other potential contenders include South Korea, which built reactors in the neighboring United Arab Emirates, and France.\nThe choice of partner will likely depend on technological offerings, financing, and geopolitical alignment, including conditions related to nuclear fuel handling.\nUranium enrichment\nA key issue is whether Washington might agree to build a uranium enrichment facility on Saudi territory, when it might do so, and whether Saudi personnel might have access to it or it would be run solely by US staff in a “black box” arrangement.\nWithout rigorous safeguards built into an agreement, Saudi Arabia, which has uranium ore reserves on its territory, could theoretically use an enrichment facility to produce highly enriched uranium, which, if purified enough, can yield fissile material for bombs.\nAnother issue is whether Riyadh would agree to make a Saudi investment in a US-based and US-owned uranium enrichment plant and to hire US companies to build Saudi nuclear reactors.\nThere are diplomatic issues too: Washington’s top regional ally Israel has repeatedly voiced opposition to the idea of a Saudi civil nuclear program.", "date": "8 May 2025, 11:44 pm", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-are-the-us-and-saudi-arabia-discussing-a-civil-nuclear-deal/", "type": "article"}

{"title": "Chair of UK Oct. 7 report: ‘Denial started while the massacres were still ongoing’", "content": "LONDON — With its minute-by-minute timeline, copious testimony from survivors and eyewitnesses, and wealth of forensic evidence and open-source footage, the 316-page report produced by British parliamentarians last month detailing the terrible events of October 7, 2023, is a comprehensive and meticulous account of the Hamas onslaught on Israel.\nThat is unsurprising. The panel responsible for the “7 October Parliamentary Commission Report” was chaired by Andrew Roberts, a renowned historian, biographer and expert on warfare, from the Battle of Waterloo to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\nIt isn’t simply Roberts’s longstanding support for Israel that led him to agree to chair the commission, but his concern over continuing attempts to whitewash Hamas’s atrocities — an effort he compares to Holocaust denial.\n“There’s a movement afoot on behalf of Hamas and its sympathizers to pretend that October 7 never happened,” he tells The Times of Israel. The report’s aim was to compile “a large amount of unimpeachable evidence to prove that it did.”\nWith an eye on history, Roberts also wanted to gather irrefutable proof to ensure that, in future decades, “the deniers” can still be challenged, even in the absence of living eyewitnesses.\nRoberts, who is not Jewish, does not underestimate the scale of the challenge.\n“It took decades for Holocaust denial to really get going,” he says, “but October 7 denial started while the actual massacres were still going [on].”\nHe recognizes that Hamas’s denial of its crimes contains multiple grim ironies. Pointing to the GoPro cameras worn by the terrorists as they perpetrated murder, torture and rape, he notes the group and its allies are “attempting to deny something that they themselves have provided the best evidence for.”\nRoberts also believes that Hamas is trying to “have their cake and eat it.”\n“They are trying to celebrate something they deny happened, and deny something that they’ve celebrated happening,” he says. “It’s unlike anything else, really. Speaking as a historian, you’ve got to come down on one side or the other about an occasion [or] a big historical event like October 7, and you’ve got to say that either it happened, and it was terrible, or that it didn’t happen.”\n“You can’t have it both ways, and yet that’s what Hamas and its supporters in the West are trying to get,” he adds.\nDepravity of human nature, filmed in real-time\nRoberts, who sits as a Conservative member of the House of Lords, and fellow members of the panel — who include Labour and Liberal Democrat parliamentarians and a former UK chief prosecutor — visited Israel and the scenes of some of the October 7 attacks. Roberts says it was both the “breadth as well as the depth” of the assault that struck him — not just the murder of some 1,200 people and abduction of 251, but the “depravity of human nature that was seen, the sheer cruelty, the sexual violence and the humiliation.”\nRoberts speaks of the “bloodlust” displayed by the assailants — they killed a 10-month-old baby and a Holocaust survivor in his 90s — as well as the “premeditation of the cruelty.”\nBlood is seen splattered in a child’s room following a massive Hamas terror onslaught on October 7, 2023, in Kibbutz Nir Oz, October 19, 2023 (AP/Francisco Seco)\nHistorically, he says, this is unusual. “Bloodlust happens a lot in history, but it’s very rare that it’s been set up so diligently and with such foresight — ‘malice aforethought’ as it used to be called,” he says.\nThe report of the 7 October Parliamentary commission, which was established by the All Party UK-Israel Parliamentary Group, isn’t an official publication of the House of Commons or the House of Lords. Roberts accepts that it has already been written off by some on social media as “Zionist propaganda” — the internet, he jokes, has become “the universal lavatory wall” — but he believes it cannot easily be “intellectually and rationally written off.”\n“Bloodlust happens a lot in history, but it’s very rare that it’s been set up so diligently and with such foresight — ‘malice aforethought’ as it used to be called”\nThe panel was careful to stick to verifiable facts, avoid speculation and focus simply on the events of October 7, he says.\n“We were not attempting to do what other reports could do better, which is to look into the intelligence failures and everything else that happened in the background to it,” Roberts says.\nThe report argues that Hamas knew that “military victory was unlikely” and instead sought to trigger an Israeli retaliation, which would isolate the country internationally and spark global outrage. However, Roberts disputes the notion that, on these terms, Hamas has already emerged victorious.\nIsraeli soldiers at the forensic center in the Shura military base near Ramle, where hundreds of bodies arrived after the October 7 Hamas onslaught, October 24, 2023. (Yossi Aloni/Flash90)\n“In terms of the propaganda war, I think they have won in that on these disgusting, ridiculous social media sites, like TikTok and Instagram, you’re getting… 10 times more anti-Israel propaganda than pro-Israeli facts and truth,” he acknowledges.\nBut, he continues, the war itself is not over and it won’t be possible to say either side has won until both sides have stopped fighting — a prospect that seems some way off. Indeed, quoting Winston Churchill’s famous words upon becoming UK prime minister in 1940, Roberts believes that Israel will eventually prevail, but it will take “a lot more blood, toil, tears and sweat.”\nCheckered history of surprise attacks\nRoberts’s belief that Hamas can be vanquished rests in part on the checkered history of surprise attacks. They may give the attacker a momentary advantage, but, with a “very few” exceptions — such as the 1967 Six Day War, when Israel launched a preemptive strike — they rarely lead to ultimate success. The Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Yom Kippur assault on Israel in October 1973, Argentina’s invasion of the Falkland Islands in April 1982, and Saddam Hussein’s grab for Kuwait in August 1990 did not see the aggressor triumph.\nWhile undertaking a surprise attack “seems like a good idea at the time… ultimately, it leads to a much worse situation for the people who launch [it],” believes Roberts. “If you launch a barbarous and vicious surprise attack, you shouldn’t be surprised about the response,” the historian says, noting the “holy rage and fury” that is stirred on the part of those who have been attacked.\n“If you launch a barbarous and vicious surprise attack, you shouldn’t be surprised about the response”\nThe author of an acclaimed biography of Churchill, Roberts has previously compared Israel’s position to that of Britain in 1940.\n“In that 12-month period from June 1940 to June 1941, Britain and her Commonwealth formed the tip of the spear against ‘the menace of tyranny,’ just as brave Israel today represents the tip of civilization’s spear against the tyranny and barbarism of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism and exterminationism,” he wrote in the Jewish Chronicle last October.\nRoberts readily admits, however, that Britain, which had not yet been joined by the US and Russia but had strong backing from the Empire and Commonwealth, was less alone than Israel is today. With the exception of the US, he says, “it’s difficult to look around the world and see countries that are really four-square behind Israel in what is essentially a struggle between civilization and barbarism.”\nHe worries that people in the West “enjoy attacking ourselves… and berating ourselves” for “perfectly reasonable” responses to surprise attacks such as 9/11 or October 7. He contrasts the response to Pearl Harbor.\nA handout photograph released by the UK Parliament shows Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, making a statement on the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 and the situation in the Middle East, in the House of Commons in London on October 7, 2024 (JESSICA TAYLOR / UK PARLIAMENT / AFP)\n“Nobody attacked FDR [who was US president at the outbreak of World War II], or, indeed at the time, [US] president Truman [under whose administration a nuclear bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki], for punishing the attack on Pearl Harbor as condignly as they did, whereas today, everybody seems to be leaping up and down, criticizing the West for punishing these equally horrific attacks,” Roberts says.\nNonetheless, Roberts is convinced that Churchill would have recognized and sympathized with Israel’s position today.\n“He was a Zionist. He didn’t subscribe to [the] antisemitism that so many of the people of his age, class and background did. He was a supporter of the Balfour Declaration and believed that the ‘Judeo’ side of Judeo-Christian civilization… gave Christianity its ethics and its positive moral angle,” he says.\nRoberts says that Churchill’s daughter had once warned him never to assume what the former prime minister would have said about any event after his death in 1965, but he is happy to wager an opinion.\n“It strikes me as very clear that he would have been as outraged as any other decent, rational, logical human being about what had happened on October 7, and he would certainly have been in favor of a terrible punishment raining down on Hamas,” Roberts says. “He was a humanitarian and so he’d have wanted to have minimized the civilian casualties in Gaza, and I believe that the IDF have done that to the best of their ability.”\nPerhaps, like Roberts, Churchill would also have seen a commonality between the enemy he defeated and that which Israel faces.\n“The overlap between Hamas ideology and Nazi ideology is so well colored in on the Venn diagram”\n“The overlap between Hamas ideology and Nazi ideology is so well colored in on the Venn diagram,” Roberts says.\nOf course, he adds, it is always “difficult and dangerous” to draw direct historical analogies. Hamas’s murderous rampage cannot be compared with the industrial-scale killing carried out by the Nazis, even if the former wore GoPro cameras and broadcast their “monstrous actions” on Facebook while the latter tried to cover up their crimes and destroy the gas chambers in 1945.\n“The analogy between Hamas and the Nazis strikes me as completely obvious one,” Roberts says. “I think you’d have to be deliberately obtuse not to see the connections.”\nThe Hamas attacks of October 7 and the ensuing conflict have confirmed Roberts’s belief that launching a war is a “profoundly immoral” act.\n“Wars are truly terrible things, which is why you shouldn’t start them,” he says, “and why you should fight them in as humanitarian a way as you can, which I think is what Israel has done.”", "date": "Today, 9:31 am", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/chair-of-uk-oct-7-report-denial-started-while-the-massacres-were-still-ongoing/", "type": "article"}

That act raised eyebrows at the Vatican and was denounced by former Italian premier Romano Prodi as indecent political interference in matters of faith.\nAnd last month, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops announced the end of a half-century of partnerships with the federal US government to serve refugees and migrant children, saying the “heartbreaking” decision followed the Trump administration’s abrupt halt to funding.\nThe majority of Leo’s posts on the X platform are related to or in support of Catholic news and church initiatives.

Pawlikowski, who taught for nearly half a century at the Catholic Theological Union until his retirement in 2017, served as co-founder and director of the school’s Catholic-Jewish Studies Program and also served four terms on the board of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.\nMore than 40 years after Leo’s ordination as a priest, Pawlikowski remembers the new pope as a good student with an open mind.\n00:00 / 23:33\n“I do remember him as a pretty bright student,” Pawlikowski said in an interview shortly after his former student was introduced to the world as the sitting bishop of Rome.\nPawlikowski added later, “My experience of him was he’s a very open-minded person who’s very much in the context of Vatican II.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nVatican II, or the Second Vatican Council, inaugurated a new era in Jewish-Catholic relations in 1965 when it issued a document, Nostra Aetate, repudiating antisemitism and stating that the Jewish people were not responsible for Jesus’ death. Ties between the two religious communities were blossoming at the time when Leo was studying for the priesthood in the late 1970s and early ‘80s.\nUnder Pawlikowski, Leo studied Catholic social teaching, which focuses on social and economic issues. Pawlikowski says relations with Jews are relevant to that field. CTU has also had a commitment to Catholic-Jewish relations since its founding and launched its formal program in the field in 1968.\nPeople hold up a US flag as the newly elected Pope Leo XIV appears at the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican, May 8, 2025. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\n“I’ve always argued that antisemitism is something that has to be counted as part of the Catholic commitment to social justice and human dignity,” he said. “My work on Catholic social teaching did include always the issue of antisemitism.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe pope spent much of his career in Peru and is thought of as a relative centrist and Vatican insider. He hasn’t been a prominent figure in Jewish-Catholic dialogue or fighting antisemitism, and doesn’t appear to have commented publicly on Israel or the war in Gaza, sparked by the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, assault. Pope Francis, his predecessor, did opine on those issues and had relations with Jewish leaders in his native Argentina.\nBut Leo’s coming of age in the era of Vatican II — plus his roots in Chicago, which has a large Jewish community, also leads Rabbi Noam Marans, the American Jewish Committee’s director of interreligious and intergroup relations, to feel optimistic.\n“He studied at CTU under John Pawlikowski and in the post-Nostra Aetate era, in the country where Catholic-Jewish relations are preeminent,” Marans said in an interview. “An American pope bodes well for the future of Catholic-Jewish relations. More than anywhere in the world, the relationship between Catholics and Jews has flourished and set a gold standard in the United States.”\nWhile Francis was outspoken in his opposition to antisemitism and his promotion of ties with Jews, he raised the ire of some Jewish leaders in recent years for his criticism of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. One of his last acts as pope was to donate his popemobile to Gaza as a mobile medical unit.\nPope Francis flanked by Rabbi Riccardo Di Segni, right, during his visit to the Great Synagogue of Rome, Sunday, Jan. 17, 2016. (AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino)\nPawlikowski said he believes “there’s a desire to carry on” with Catholic-Jewish relations, though he added, “the situation in Israel and Gaza has had a dramatic effect.”\nWill his former student begin a new chapter in Catholic-Jewish ties? Pawlikowski said it’s too soon to tell, given that Leo has not thus far focused on the issue.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“He hasn’t really been stationed in any area where there was a really pronounced Jewish community,” he said. “On the question of interreligious [affairs], he’ll have to show us where he is, but I would assume he had an outgoing, positive attitude generally.”\nIn his first address as pope, Leo issued a call to dialogue.\n“Help us as well — help one another — to build bridges through dialogue, through encounter, uniting everyone to be one single people always in peace,” he said.\nRabbi Joshua Stanton, associate vice president for interfaith and intergroup initiatives at the Jewish Federations of North America, saw that as a sign that the pope is committed to Catholic-Jewish relations. He noted that this year is Nostra Aetate’s 60th anniversary, which he hopes Leo commemorates in an active way.\n“I’m very hopeful that he referenced the importance of dialogue and reaching out beyond the Catholic Church to other religious communities,” Stanton said. Stanton noted that Leo has a reputation for “quiet efficacy,” and as he settles into his position, Stanton said he’ll be looking at how the pontiff acts.\n“Does he invite Jewish leaders to the Vatican to meet with him?” he said. “Does he invite leaders from other traditions? Does he try to bring multiple groups together at the same time?”\nThe focus of Leo’s address on Thursday was peace. With war raging in Gaza, Marans did not take that as a specific reference to the Middle East.\n“All popes want peace,” he said. “May I add, all Catholics, Jews, rabbis want peace.”", "date": "Today, 1:27 am", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/leo-xiv-first-american-pope-studied-under-pioneer-in-jewish-catholic-relations/", "type": "article"}
{"title": "US judge says there’s reason to believe US-based media nonprofit aided Hamas", "content": "A US federal judge on Tuesday said there was reason to believe a US nonprofit knew its employee was holding Israelis captive in Gaza and was affiliated with Hamas, marking a win for former hostages in a legal battle against the group.\nThe judge’s statement came in response to a lawsuit by freed hostages Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv. All three were taken from the Nova music festival in southern Israel during Hamas’s October 2023 invasion of Israel.\nThey were held in Gaza by Abdallah Aljamal, according to the lawsuit and the IDF. Aljamal was a writer for the Palestine Chronicle, a news outlet run by the People Media Project, a US-based, tax-exempt nonprofit that is the focus of the lawsuit.\nThe hostages were rescued after 246 days in captivity in an IDF operation in June that also extracted hostage Noa Argamani, who was held separately nearby. Aljamal, his wife Fatima and his father Ahmad Aljamal were all killed during the hostage rescue mission. The family’s children survived.\nThe lawsuit argues that the Palestine Chronicle provided Aljamal with a platform to “disseminate Hamas propaganda,” providing material support to a US-designated terrorist organization, in violation of international law.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe defendants filed to dismiss the case in March. Tuesday’s letter was a response to that motion.\nUS District Judge Tiffany Cartwright said the hostages had “stated a plausible claim that [the Palestine Chronicle] aided and abetted their kidnapping and Hamas’s acts of terrorism.”\nCartwright added that the Palestine Chronicle’s claims that it was ignorant of Aljamal’s terror ties were “unpersuasive.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraeli hostages pictured after their rescue from Hamas captivity in Gaza on June 8, 2024. From left: Shlomi Ziv (IDF); Andrey Kozlov and Almog Meir Jan (Avshalom Sassoni/Flash90); and Noa Argamani (Courtesy).\nAljamal’s direct communications with the defendants, his public appearances as a Hamas spokesperson, and his social media support for Hamas “support a reasonable inference that [the Palestine Chronicle] knew Aljamal was affiliated with Hamas and involved in the October 7 attack,” the judge said.\nShe added that the close relationship between the Palestine Chronicle and Aljamal, and the timing of their coordination on work activities, were reasons to believe that the nonprofit’s payments to Aljaamal assisted him in holding the hostages.\nThe court denied the Palestine Chronicle’s motion to dismiss and an attempt to prevent the case from entering the discovery phase.\nThe lawsuit, backed by the National Jewish Advocacy Center, was filed in a federal court in Washington State, where the People Media Project is based.\nThe lawsuit has also revealed that Aljamal told the hostages that “Hamas was in contact and actively coordinating with its affiliates in the media and on college campuses,” according to an amended complaint filed in February that was first reported by The Times of Israel.\nAljamal told the hostages that “Hamas was going to ensure that the United States, as well as Jews and Israelis, are hated everywhere and that Hamas in Gaza was coordinating with its allies, including its allies in the media and on college campuses, to foment hatred against Israel and Jews,” the complaint said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnti-Israel activists protest outside Columbia University, January 21, 2025. (Luke Tress/Times of Israel)\nThe Palestine Chronicle was reporting about US campus protests around the same time, and in August 2024, published an article about Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal urging university students to protest.\nAljamal was previously a spokesperson for the Hamas-run labor ministry in Gaza. He was open about his affiliation with the terror group, appearing publicly in Arabic media as a spokesperson and posting Hamas graphics and photos of his son wearing a Hamas headband on social media. He began writing for the Palestine Chronicle in 2019 while still serving as a spokesperson for Hamas’s labor ministry, according to the lawsuit.\nAljamal appears to have had foreknowledge of the Hamas attack. On October 7, at 5:43 a.m., immediately before the invasion, he posted a message on TikTok that said, “O God, guide us.. O God, grant us the victory that you promised.. O God, acceptance, acceptance, acceptance.. Your victory, O God,” followed by a heart emoji.\nLater in the day, Aljamal praised the attack on Facebook.\nHe began writing for the Palestine Chronicle more frequently after the attack, sometimes publishing multiple articles per day, while he was holding the Israelis hostage and communicating with the outlet’s staff in the US.\nImmediately after the hostage rescue, the Palestine Chronicle changed Aljamal’s description on its website from “correspondent” to “contributor,” then later described him as a “freelance contributor” writing on “a voluntary basis.” It also eulogized him in an article after his death, calling him a “well-known journalist murdered in Gaza,” and denied that he had been holding the hostages.\nThe hostages were aware that Aljamal was communicating with terror groups, recording footage and writing about their own captivity, the complaint said. All three were “terrorized” during their captivity, subjected to arbitrary punishment, physical threats, and physical and psychological abuse, the lawsuit said.\nThe outlet’s tax-exempt status means US taxpayers were subsidizing Hamas propaganda published to a US audience, the lawsuit argues, adding that the salary he was paid also helped him imprison the hostages.", "date": "Today, 12:54 am", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-judge-says-theres-reason-to-believe-us-based-nonprofit-aided-hamas/", "type": "article"}

Three have died,” without providing additional details.\nAsked whether Israel was disappointed in Trump’s commenting on the sensitive issue and contradicting Israel’s official number at the time, the PMO told The Times of Israel: “We very much welcome President Trump’s and the American people’s commitment to the security and the safety and the ongoing future of this country. We see eye to eye in every single way. There is no daylight between our two governments because we coordinate all of our actions together.”\nTrump’s comments sent shockwaves through the families of the hostages, who demanded on Wednesday that they be provided with any updated intelligence on their loved ones.\nAmid the resurgent worry over the hostages’ status, Haaretz also revealed Wednesday that in a military document outlining plans for a new Gaza offensive, the IDF had ranked the return of the hostages as its least important objective.\nThe document, presented to commanders on Tuesday, placed the Hamas-held captives in sixth and last place, a fact incongruent with army officials’ previous assertions to the Israeli public that the return of the hostages was the IDF’s most important war goal.\nADVERTISEMENT\nProtesters in Habima Square in Tel Aviv on May 3, 2025, call for elections now and for the release of all the hostages.

We are saying, take this deal now, because if we start a war and there is a deal, it will be under far worse circumstances for you. Take the deal, because now there is an opportunity, a window.”\nAsked to what extent Trump’s upcoming Middle East visit will influence Israel’s military and strategic plans in Gaza, the PMO told The Times of Israel on Thursday that “Washington DC and Jerusalem are working side by side, shoulder to shoulder. We are fully coordinated, we are fully cooperating, as befits the closeness of our relationship and the shared values, and also the shared threats that we face.”\nThe PMO also said that “Israel is examining ways right now as we speak so that aid can be delivered into Gaza to get to the people that need it and not to Hamas, who steal it.

{"title": "The first American pope is a Trump critic", "content": "Elected Thursday as the Catholic Church’s first global leader to hail from the United States, Pope Leo XIV is in a new job that will have many crossovers into politics — a realm not entirely unknown to the Chicago-born priest, whose social media history includes sharing criticism of US President Donald Trump and his administration policies and of comments by Vice President JD Vance.\nTrump has wished the new pope well in his role, calling Leo’s election “such an honor for our country.” But it comes days after Trump posted an artificial intelligence-generated image of himself dressed as pope amid days of official mourning for Pope Francis. That act raised eyebrows at the Vatican and was denounced by former Italian premier Romano Prodi as indecent political interference in matters of faith.\nAnd last month, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops announced the end of a half-century of partnerships with the federal US government to serve refugees and migrant children, saying the “heartbreaking” decision followed the Trump administration’s abrupt halt to funding.\n00:00 / 23:33\nThe majority of Leo’s posts on the X platform are related to or in support of Catholic news and church initiatives. He rarely writes original content, but a look back through his social media timeline shows numerous posts sharing viewpoints opposed to moves aimed at restricting acceptance of migrants and refugees in the US.\nCriticism of Vance’s views\nVance, a convert to Catholicism, is currently the most high-profile Catholic in American politics. He’s drawn attention from the man who now leads the global church, with his views prompting Leo to return to X after a nearly two-year absence to share criticism.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nIn early February, Leo shared an article from a Catholic publication with the headline, “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt came days after Vance — in discussing critiques of the Trump administration’s immigration policies — in a Fox News interview had referenced a Christian tenet “that you love your family and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens, and then after that, prioritize the rest of the world.”\nIn response to online criticism of his position, Vance posted on X, “Just google ‘ordo amoris.’ Aside from that, the idea that there isn’t a hierarchy of obligations violates basic common sense.”\n“Ordo amoris,” a historic Catholic tenet, translates to “order of love.”\nTen days after his initial post, Leo shared another piece from a Jesuit publication, titled “Pope Francis’ letter, JD Vance’s ‘ordo amoris’ and what the Gospel asks of all of us on immigration.”\nPrior to his first February post, Leo had been dormant on X since July 2023.\nAfter Leo’s election Thursday, Vance posted congratulations on X, adding, ”I’m sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church. May God bless him!”\nADVERTISEMENT\nPope Leo is expected to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Pope Francis, a champion of the poor and of immigrants, who also had his differences with the Trump administration. Vance played down those differences after meeting with Francis at the Vatican the day before he died, but they were substantial. Francis had called Trump’s immigration policies a disgrace.\nPope Francis receives US Vice President JD Vance before bestowing the Urbi et Orbi (Latin for to the city and to the world) blessing at the end of the Easter mass presided over by Cardinal Angelo Comastri in St. Peter’s Square at the Vatican, April 20, 2025 (Vatican Media via AP, HO)\nThe new pope’s final post as Cardinal Robert Prevost was a recirculation on April 14 of a post by church chronicler Rocco Palmo about Trump’s Oval Office meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.\nBukele said it was “preposterous” for his country to bring a Maryland man who was wrongly deported there in March back to the US, despite a Supreme Court ruling calling on the administration to “facilitate” Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s return.\nLeo reposted Palmo’s link to an article by Washington-area Bishop Evelio Menjivar — who was born in El Salvador — asking, “Do you not see the suffering? Is your conscience not disturbed? How can you stay quiet?”\nLeo’s critiques of Trump date back nearly a decade.\nWhen Trump’s first presidential campaign ramped up in July 2015, he posted to X a Washington Post op-ed by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, with the headline, “Why Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric is so problematic.”\nIn the wake of Trump’s first election in 2016, Leo reposted a homily in which Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez — characterizing the fear among many, including schoolchildren who “think the government is going to come and deport their parents, any day now” — said that America is “better than this.”\nDays later, Leo also posted an article by a Catholic outlet quoting Democrats as saying that, in her loss, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton “ignored pro-lifers at her own peril.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nPope Francis elevates to cardinal the US prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops Robert Francis Prevost during a consistory to create 21 new cardinals at St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican on September 30, 2023.

Accordingly, the Israeli plan is to resume aid in the coming days or weeks.\nStill, the goal of the new initiative with GHF is to ensure that aid is not diverted by Hamas, something Israel says it hasn’t succeeded in doing since the start of the war.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCritics have argued that the government’s refusal to stand up a viable Palestinian alternative to Hamas has allowed the terror group to remain a dominant force in Gaza, even if it has taken debilitating blows due to Israeli military activities.\nPalestinians struggle to get donated food at a community kitchen in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, May 5, 2025.

Those entering the zone will pass through army checkpoints, in what the IDF hopes will prevent Hamas fighters from reaching the area.\nAid will be distributed from the SDSs in boxes that will contain 50 1,750-calorie meals, hygiene kits and medical supplies, according to the memo. Five to six thousand vetted representatives will be allowed to travel by foot to the aid hubs once every week or two in order to pick up a roughly 40-pound (18-kilogram) box of food for their families, said officials briefed on the plan.\n“To ensure the integrity and safety of aid delivery, GHF’s logistics subcontractors will utilize armored vehicles to transport supplies to and from SDS locations,” the memo states. The subcontractors will include American security firms, such as UG Solutions and Safe Reach Solutions, which helped secure the Netzarim Corridor earlier this year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe IDF will not be stationed at or near the SDSs in order to “maintain the neutral and civilian-facing nature of operations,” the memo said.\nDisplaced Palestinians cross a checkpoint manned by US and Egyptian security at the Netzarim Corridor as people make their way from the south to the north of the Gaza Strip, on Salah al-Din road, in central Gaza, on January 29, 2025.

Under former US president Joe Biden, nuclear talks were an element of a wider US-Saudi deal tied to normalization and Riyadh’s goal of a defense treaty with Washington.\nThe kingdom has repeatedly said it would not recognize Israel without a guarantee of a viable path to a Palestinian state, frustrating Biden administration attempts to expand the Abraham Accords signed during Trump’s first term. Under those accords, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco normalized relations with Israel. Progress toward Saudi recognition of Israel has been halted by fury in Arab countries over the war raging in Gaza. The nuclear talks had also stumbled over Washington’s non-proliferation concerns.\n00:00 / 23:33\nIn a possible sign of a new approach, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that Saudi Arabia and the United States were on a “pathway” to a civil nuclear agreement when he visited the kingdom in April.\n“When we have something to announce, you will hear it from the President.

It wasn’t clear what the official was expecting Israel to do.\n“The ceasefire agreement with the Houthis is just a prelude, and if Israel doesn’t wake up, the ‘Deal of the Millennium’ will also be finalized without it,” the official reportedly said, adding that “We hope Israel will get on board this historic train that’s already left the station.”\nThe official’s warning of a weakening alliance between Israel and the US greatly worried the families of the hostages, said the report, as US mediators play a major role in the ongoing negotiations to reach a hostage-ceasefire deal that could potentially set their loved ones free.\nSell more oil\nRiyadh wants to build nuclear generation capacity because it seeks to diversify its economy away from oil.

Iran insists it is purely for civil purposes. However, the Islamic Republic has enriched uranium to levels only necessary for military purposes and has called for the destruction of Israel since its founding.\nUS Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday described the talks with Iran as “so far, so good” and said there was a deal to be made that would reintegrate Iran into the global economy while preventing it from getting a nuclear weapon.\nSaudi Arabia and the United States are set to discuss a number of blockbuster economic deals during Trump’s visit next week, with the US poised to offer Saudi Arabia an arms package worth well over $100 billion, sources have told Reuters.\nTrump has said Riyadh should “round up” a planned investment package in the US to $1 trillion from an initial $600 billion.\nThe trip is Trump’s second visit abroad, after a short trip to Rome for the pope’s funeral, since he returned to office in January.

{"title": "Ben Cohen of Ben & Jerry’s goes on Tucker Carlson and says, ‘I love Jesus Christ’", "content": "JTA — Four years ago, when the founders of Ben & Jerry’s took to The New York Times to defend their creamery’s West Bank settlement boycott, the opening of their op-ed read, “We are the founders of Ben & Jerry’s. We are also proud Jews.”\nFor at least one of them, that may have changed.\nBen Cohen, the Ben of the pair, appeared on Tucker Carlson’s talk show this week, mostly to discuss his opposition to US involvement in the Ukraine war and the Pentagon’s sprawling budget, issues where his long-touted progressive ideals can overlap with Carlson’s far-right ones.\n00:00 / 23:33\nThen, at the end of the hour-long show, Carlson asked Cohen about his “spiritual beliefs.”\n“In terms of a spiritual belief, I mean, I don’t practice a religion,” Cohen responded. “I was born a Jew. I love Jesus Christ. I think the words that he said are wonderful, are amazing. And, you know, I’m kind of distressed that a lot of organized Christian religions are not really, I don’t know, abiding by the words of Jesus Christ.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nHe added, “I think if we could follow the words of Jesus Christ and think about the Sermon on the Mount and, you know, take his words seriously, we wouldn’t be doing the stuff we’re currently doing.”\nThe Sermon on the Mount, in the New Testament Gospel of Matthew, is a series of widely known sayings in which Jesus outlines his moral vision.\nCohen’s religious inclinations are significant because Carlson is known for inviting antisemites, including a Holocaust revisionist, onto his show in the past. They are also important because Cohen and his co-founder Jerry Greenfield publicly marshaled their Judaism in defense of their company’s 2021 boycott.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe boycott drew widespread opposition from centrist and right-leaning Jewish groups, a wave of state-level legal challenges and led to a court battle that lasted years. Cohen and Greenfield — who grew up attending Hebrew school together on Long Island — sold the company to Unilever decades ago and no longer control it, though recently Cohen was reportedly planning a buyback.\n“That we support the company’s decision is not a contradiction nor is it anti-Semitic,” the pair wrote in the Times op-ed. “In fact, we believe this act can and should be seen as advancing the concepts of justice and human rights, core tenets of Judaism.”\nLater, they added, “As Jewish supporters of the State of Israel, we fundamentally reject the notion that it is anti-Semitic to question the policies of the State of Israel.”\nThe Carlson show, posted on Monday, also raises questions about whether Cohen would still identify as a supporter of Israel. The bulk of the interview was about Ukraine and the US defense budget, but near the end, when discussing why he thinks “we’re kind of headed toward war” in Iran, Cohen brought up Israel.\n“There seems to be some kind of strange relationship between Israel and the US, where, I don’t know, Israel now has the US supplying weapons for its genocide,” Cohen said. “And what I’m told is that Israel wants some concept of greater Israel. I mean, I don’t really know much about that.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n(The term “greater Israel” has generally referred to Israeli control of territories such as the West Bank and Gaza, rather than its regional conflict with Iran.)\nIn response to a subsequent question, he said, “Right now what it means to be American is that we are the world’s largest arms exporter, we have the largest military in the world, we support the slaughter of people in Gaza, if somebody protests the slaughter of people in Gaza, we arrest them. What does our country stand for?”\nThis is not the first time this year that Cohen has accused Israel of genocide in its war against Hamas in Gaza, a charge the country strenuously rejects. In March, he said, “The US supporting this genocide is essentially trampling on the soul of America,” and added, “It’s not a war, it’s a slaughter. I don’t think there’s much difference between somebody getting killed by a bomb or getting killed by being thrown in a gas chamber.”\nIn the interview on Monday, Carlson did not address Cohen’s statements on Israel. He seconded Cohen’s praise of Jesus.\nCohen has also recently begun promoting a website to back DOGE, the Elon Musk-run operation that has rapidly slashed parts of the federal government, including large global humanitarian programs. A request for comment via that website, which Cohen touts on his X account, was not immediately returned.", "date": "8 May 2025, 4:57 pm", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/ben-cohen-of-ben-jerrys-goes-on-tucker-carlson-and-says-i-love-jesus-christ/?utm_campaign=most_popular&utm_source=website&utm_medium=article_end&utm_content=10", "type": "article"}

There was a noticeable drop in Houthi attacks on civilian shipping and in total attacks starting in the summer of 2024. The recent intensified campaign took out leaders, stockpiles, and infrastructure. Resupply is becoming harder for the Houthis, and they’ve fired much of their high-end arsenal.\nBut even facing hundreds of US strikes, they continued shooting at US military vessels and at Israel.\nThough Israel has shown it is capable of pulling off long-range raids in Yemen, it would not be able to match the US operational tempo.\nFire and smoke can be seen rising in the distance in a video captured in Yemen following an Israeli strike on the Houthi-controlled Hodeidah port, September 29, 2024.

Trump surprised Jerusalem with his announcement, and didn’t seem to care much about what it meant for Israel’s security.\nThis mirrors the nightmare scenario for Israel as Trump pursues nuclear talks with Iran.\nWith Israel on the sidelines, the president could suddenly announce a deal with Iran that leaves its nuclear program intact.

Under former US president Joe Biden, nuclear talks were an element of a wider US-Saudi deal tied to normalization and Riyadh’s goal of a defense treaty with Washington.\nThe kingdom has repeatedly said it would not recognize Israel without a guarantee of a viable path to a Palestinian state, frustrating Biden administration attempts to expand the Abraham Accords signed during Trump’s first term. Under those accords, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco normalized relations with Israel.

Iran insists it is purely for civil purposes. However, the Islamic Republic has enriched uranium to levels only necessary for military purposes and has called for the destruction of Israel since its founding.\nUS Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday described the talks with Iran as “so far, so good” and said there was a deal to be made that would reintegrate Iran into the global economy while preventing it from getting a nuclear weapon.\nSaudi Arabia and the United States are set to discuss a number of blockbuster economic deals during Trump’s visit next week, with the US poised to offer Saudi Arabia an arms package worth well over $100 billion, sources have told Reuters.\nTrump has said Riyadh should “round up” a planned investment package in the US to $1 trillion from an initial $600 billion.\nThe trip is Trump’s second visit abroad, after a short trip to Rome for the pope’s funeral, since he returned to office in January.

{"title": "His first term was remarkable for Israel from the start. What is Trump up to this time?", "content": "This Editor’s Note was sent out earlier Wednesday in ToI’s weekly update email to members of the Times of Israel Community. To receive these Editor’s Notes as they’re released, join the ToI Community here.\nOn his first trip to our immediate neighborhood as US president, in June 2009, Barack Obama flew to Cairo and delivered an outreach speech to the Muslim world in which he related to Israel largely in the context of the Holocaust and made no mention of sovereign Jewish history in the Holy Land. He flew home without so much as a stopover in Israel, the United States’ one and only democratic, ultra-dependable ally in this part of the world.\nBy contrast, Donald Trump, in his first visit anywhere overseas as president, spent two days in Israel in May 2017, stood with his head bowed at the Western Wall and highlighted what he said was his “privilege” to address the people of Israel in the ancient city of Jerusalem. “I make this promise to you,” he declared in the final public event of his visit, at the Israel Museum, “my administration will always stand with Israel.”\n00:00 / 23:33\n“Iran’s leaders routinely call for Israel’s destruction,” Trump noted bitterly in that same speech, and then departed from the prepared text on the teleprompters to vow: “Not with Donald J Trump, believe me!” His audience, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, stood and cheered. “Thank you,” he said three times, as the applause went on and on. And when it had finally faded, he waved out a hand and said, with a smile, “I like you too.” The room filled with a warm, appreciative rumble of laughter.\nUS President Donald Trump delivers a speech at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem on May 23, 2017. (AFP Photo/Menahem Kahana)\nFlash forward eight years, Trump is back in the White House and is about to make his first trip to the region since reelection. As in 2017, he will be going to Saudi Arabia. Unlike in 2017, he said on Tuesday that he would not be visiting Israel this time.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nHe may yet change his mind. The “very, very big announcement” he is teasing ahead of his departure could remake any understanding of what he is planning and doing in this region. But for Israel, from a president with a proven first-term record of dramatic pro-Israel action — recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the US embassy here, brokering the Abraham Accords, and withdrawing from the Obama-led, terribly flawed 2015 JCPOA agreement on Iran’s nuclear program — the words and deeds in these first 100-plus days are increasingly worrying.\nWithout informing Israel in advance, he opened direct talks with Hamas, via an emissary, Adam Boehler, who plainly did not recognize Hamas’s eliminate-Israel raison d’être, overseen by his most important foreign policy envoy, Steve Witkoff, who also thinks Hamas is not “ideologically intractable.”\nSpringing the news on Netanyahu just before telling the rest of the world, with a helpless prime minister at his side in the Oval Office, he initiated talks with Iran, again with Witkoff in the leading role. And he and his key officials have spent the past month flipping back and forth on whether a deal that he says “is going to happen” will require the cessation of all Iranian uranium enrichment… or not, and will entail the dismantling of all Iran’s nuclear facilities… or not. Meaning, it will actually prevent a regime dead-set on attaining a nuclear weapons arsenal from achieving that goal, with Israel its prime target… or not.\nADVERTISEMENT\nApparently without significant consultation with Netanyahu, he had previously unveiled a bizarre vision for taking over and leveling Gaza, and turning it into a Middle East real estate “riviera” development project, shifting characteristically again on whether this would involve the forced expulsion of all Gazans, and offering no credible mechanism for distinguishing between the “wonderful” non-Hamas Gazans he would rehouse who-knows-where and the inhumane Hamas Gazans who would need to be eliminated.\nSmoke in the area of Ben Gurion Airport after a ballistic missile was fired at Israel from Yemen on May 4, 2025 (Screen grab from social media used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)\nAnd then on Tuesday, two days after Yemen’s Houthi terror group breached Israel’s usually effective air defenses and fired a ballistic missile into the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport, a few hundred yards from the main control tower — prompting almost every international airline to cancel their flights to and from our beleaguered little country — he announced that he had reached an agreement with the Houthis under which the US would no longer be targeting their assets.\nAstonishingly, again, he did not forewarn Israel — a country whose own airlines are now its only dependable connection to the rest of the world, as a direct consequence of the malevolent activities of a terror group he has now let off the hook. If the president made an effort to require that the Houthis stop targeting Israel as part of his deal with them, he evidently did not insist upon it, since the Houthis followed his latest bombshell-for-Israel announcement by stating that they would indeed continue to attack us and, indeed, fired a drone in our direction on Wednesday morning.\nWere it not for that dramatically Israel-supportive first term — not just rhetoric, but demonstrative, incredibly far-reaching action — you might be forgiven for wondering whether Trump had taken office at strategic odds with Israel, or at least fairly indifferent to Israel, perhaps in the grip of the personal anti-Netanyahu animus that was so evident when he declared “Fuck him,” in comments published in January 2021, because the prime minister had ostensibly been too quick to congratulate Joe Biden on winning the 2020 presidential elections.\nTrump came into office, this time around, promising to stop wars and to put America first. The first of those goals, if achievable, is entirely laudable and hugely beneficial to humankind. And every nation’s leader has a primary obligation to look first to his or her country’s interests. But you cannot partially stop wars, or cut deals with enemy nations, solely on the basis of your country’s self-interest, least of all when you’re the head of a global superpower and your presidential role includes leadership of the free world. That would constitute the abandonment of your allies and only a fleeting victory for America’s own interests, since the genocidal enemies the free world is facing cannot be subdued by — indeed are empowered by — short-term and inadequate agreements.\nAs things stand, Israel has widening cause for concern from a US president that our leadership and a sizable majority of the nation were confident would put Israel’s wellbeing high on his global agenda. That “very, very big announcement” better be a real zinger.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signs a guest book at the White House as US President Donald Trump looks on in Washington DC, April 7, 2025 (Avi Ohayon/GPO)\nGoing up in flames\nWith the US led by an unpredictable leader, the need for Israel to come together in its own defense has never been greater.\nIsrael has always championed its capacity to defend itself, by itself, but has also depended on core external allies for military, diplomatic and all manner of other practical and psychological support. Since October 7, with the despicable rush to blame the victim — Israel, as it has struggled to defang Gaza’s entrenched, cynical, Hamas government and to secure the release of our hostages — that international support has been in perhaps unprecedentedly steep decline.\nYet Netanyahu continues to whip up internal divides, by decrying all political and public opponents as tools of our enemies, hacking away at all independent state institutions, discrediting the judiciary, and upholding the ultra-Orthodox community’s refusal to serve even as the burden on our reserves forces weighs ever more heavily.\nIDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir (center) is seen in Gaza City’s Shejaiya neighborhood, April 15, 2025. (Israel Defense Forces)\nNow he is about to embark on a vastly expanded military operation in Gaza — which risks endangering the hostages, will see more soldiers killed, will kill more Gazans, but which Netanyahu insists will succeed where 18 months of warfare have failed in achieving “total victory.” He claims the latest war plan was produced and recommended by the IDF’s chief of staff.\nYet his far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, on whose support he depends, enthused this week that this operation will eventuate not in the replacement of Hamas by reliable local, regional and/or international governance, but in the “total destruction” of Gaza, the confining of its population to a narrow border area, and the permanent reoccupation of the Strip by Israel and Israeli forces, which is certainly not the IDF’s declared goal.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) in a video with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich after passing the 2025 state budget, March 25, 2025.

Parts of the country were actually going up in flames as we tried to celebrate independence, with the TV broadcasts flipping from prerecorded celebrations to real-time wildfires, with the heroic fire and rescue services — overseen by ministerial pyromaniac Itamar Ben Gvir, and rendered strategically under-resourced by our dysfunctional government — desperately trying to gain control over the blazes, even as Netanyahu inaccurately blamed Arab arsonists and his vicious son pointed a finger at “the left.”\nA fire is seen raging near decommissioned tanks at Yad Lashiryon, the Armored Corps Memorial Site and Museum, next to Latrun outside Jerusalem, April 30, 2025.

In their honor, I urge the Israeli people to choose unity over division, vision over disagreement and hope over despair.

Perhaps he’s playing a game so clever that, when all is revealed, Iran, the Houthis, Hamas et al will find themselves outmaneuvered and helpless, and we’ll see Trump’s promised new Abraham Accords allies partnering with Israel, and our nation vastly more secure.\nEvidently, Israel’s leaders are having trouble exerting much influence. So we can only hope.\n“The ties of the Jewish people to this Holy Land are ancient and eternal. They date back thousands of years, including the reign of King David, whose star now flies proudly on Israel’s white and blue flag.” So said Donald Trump, first-term president of the United States, in Jerusalem on May 23, 2017 — doing what his predecessor had failed to in stressing our connection to this land, on an early visit to Israel that his predecessor had chosen not to make.\n“But a hopeful future for children in the Middle East requires the world to fully recognize the vital role of the state of Israel,” Trump went on. “And, on behalf of the United States, we pledge to stand by you and defend our shared values so that together we can defeat terrorism and create safety for all of God’s children.”\nAmen to that.", "date": "7 May 2025, 4:57 pm", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/his-first-term-was-remarkable-for-israel-from-the-start-what-is-trump-up-to-this-time/", "type": "article"}
{"title": "Chair of UK Oct. 7 report: ‘Denial started while the massacres were still ongoing’", "content": "LONDON — With its minute-by-minute timeline, copious testimony from survivors and eyewitnesses, and wealth of forensic evidence and open-source footage, the 316-page report produced by British parliamentarians last month detailing the terrible events of October 7, 2023, is a comprehensive and meticulous account of the Hamas onslaught on Israel.\nThat is unsurprising. The panel responsible for the “7 October Parliamentary Commission Report” was chaired by Andrew Roberts, a renowned historian, biographer and expert on warfare, from the Battle of Waterloo to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\nIt isn’t simply Roberts’s longstanding support for Israel that led him to agree to chair the commission, but his concern over continuing attempts to whitewash Hamas’s atrocities — an effort he compares to Holocaust denial.\n“There’s a movement afoot on behalf of Hamas and its sympathizers to pretend that October 7 never happened,” he tells The Times of Israel. The report’s aim was to compile “a large amount of unimpeachable evidence to prove that it did.”\nWith an eye on history, Roberts also wanted to gather irrefutable proof to ensure that, in future decades, “the deniers” can still be challenged, even in the absence of living eyewitnesses.\nRoberts, who is not Jewish, does not underestimate the scale of the challenge.\n“It took decades for Holocaust denial to really get going,” he says, “but October 7 denial started while the actual massacres were still going [on].”\nHe recognizes that Hamas’s denial of its crimes contains multiple grim ironies. Pointing to the GoPro cameras worn by the terrorists as they perpetrated murder, torture and rape, he notes the group and its allies are “attempting to deny something that they themselves have provided the best evidence for.”\nRoberts also believes that Hamas is trying to “have their cake and eat it.”\n“They are trying to celebrate something they deny happened, and deny something that they’ve celebrated happening,” he says. “It’s unlike anything else, really. Speaking as a historian, you’ve got to come down on one side or the other about an occasion [or] a big historical event like October 7, and you’ve got to say that either it happened, and it was terrible, or that it didn’t happen.”\n“You can’t have it both ways, and yet that’s what Hamas and its supporters in the West are trying to get,” he adds.\nDepravity of human nature, filmed in real-time\nRoberts, who sits as a Conservative member of the House of Lords, and fellow members of the panel — who include Labour and Liberal Democrat parliamentarians and a former UK chief prosecutor — visited Israel and the scenes of some of the October 7 attacks. Roberts says it was both the “breadth as well as the depth” of the assault that struck him — not just the murder of some 1,200 people and abduction of 251, but the “depravity of human nature that was seen, the sheer cruelty, the sexual violence and the humiliation.”\nRoberts speaks of the “bloodlust” displayed by the assailants — they killed a 10-month-old baby and a Holocaust survivor in his 90s — as well as the “premeditation of the cruelty.”\nBlood is seen splattered in a child’s room following a massive Hamas terror onslaught on October 7, 2023, in Kibbutz Nir Oz, October 19, 2023 (AP/Francisco Seco)\nHistorically, he says, this is unusual. “Bloodlust happens a lot in history, but it’s very rare that it’s been set up so diligently and with such foresight — ‘malice aforethought’ as it used to be called,” he says.\nThe report of the 7 October Parliamentary commission, which was established by the All Party UK-Israel Parliamentary Group, isn’t an official publication of the House of Commons or the House of Lords. Roberts accepts that it has already been written off by some on social media as “Zionist propaganda” — the internet, he jokes, has become “the universal lavatory wall” — but he believes it cannot easily be “intellectually and rationally written off.”\n“Bloodlust happens a lot in history, but it’s very rare that it’s been set up so diligently and with such foresight — ‘malice aforethought’ as it used to be called”\nThe panel was careful to stick to verifiable facts, avoid speculation and focus simply on the events of October 7, he says.\n“We were not attempting to do what other reports could do better, which is to look into the intelligence failures and everything else that happened in the background to it,” Roberts says.\nThe report argues that Hamas knew that “military victory was unlikely” and instead sought to trigger an Israeli retaliation, which would isolate the country internationally and spark global outrage. However, Roberts disputes the notion that, on these terms, Hamas has already emerged victorious.\nIsraeli soldiers at the forensic center in the Shura military base near Ramle, where hundreds of bodies arrived after the October 7 Hamas onslaught, October 24, 2023. (Yossi Aloni/Flash90)\n“In terms of the propaganda war, I think they have won in that on these disgusting, ridiculous social media sites, like TikTok and Instagram, you’re getting… 10 times more anti-Israel propaganda than pro-Israeli facts and truth,” he acknowledges.\nBut, he continues, the war itself is not over and it won’t be possible to say either side has won until both sides have stopped fighting — a prospect that seems some way off. Indeed, quoting Winston Churchill’s famous words upon becoming UK prime minister in 1940, Roberts believes that Israel will eventually prevail, but it will take “a lot more blood, toil, tears and sweat.”\nCheckered history of surprise attacks\nRoberts’s belief that Hamas can be vanquished rests in part on the checkered history of surprise attacks. They may give the attacker a momentary advantage, but, with a “very few” exceptions — such as the 1967 Six Day War, when Israel launched a preemptive strike — they rarely lead to ultimate success. The Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Yom Kippur assault on Israel in October 1973, Argentina’s invasion of the Falkland Islands in April 1982, and Saddam Hussein’s grab for Kuwait in August 1990 did not see the aggressor triumph.\nWhile undertaking a surprise attack “seems like a good idea at the time… ultimately, it leads to a much worse situation for the people who launch [it],” believes Roberts. “If you launch a barbarous and vicious surprise attack, you shouldn’t be surprised about the response,” the historian says, noting the “holy rage and fury” that is stirred on the part of those who have been attacked.\n“If you launch a barbarous and vicious surprise attack, you shouldn’t be surprised about the response”\nThe author of an acclaimed biography of Churchill, Roberts has previously compared Israel’s position to that of Britain in 1940.\n“In that 12-month period from June 1940 to June 1941, Britain and her Commonwealth formed the tip of the spear against ‘the menace of tyranny,’ just as brave Israel today represents the tip of civilization’s spear against the tyranny and barbarism of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism and exterminationism,” he wrote in the Jewish Chronicle last October.\nRoberts readily admits, however, that Britain, which had not yet been joined by the US and Russia but had strong backing from the Empire and Commonwealth, was less alone than Israel is today. With the exception of the US, he says, “it’s difficult to look around the world and see countries that are really four-square behind Israel in what is essentially a struggle between civilization and barbarism.”\nHe worries that people in the West “enjoy attacking ourselves… and berating ourselves” for “perfectly reasonable” responses to surprise attacks such as 9/11 or October 7. He contrasts the response to Pearl Harbor.\nA handout photograph released by the UK Parliament shows Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, making a statement on the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 and the situation in the Middle East, in the House of Commons in London on October 7, 2024 (JESSICA TAYLOR / UK PARLIAMENT / AFP)\n“Nobody attacked FDR [who was US president at the outbreak of World War II], or, indeed at the time, [US] president Truman [under whose administration a nuclear bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki], for punishing the attack on Pearl Harbor as condignly as they did, whereas today, everybody seems to be leaping up and down, criticizing the West for punishing these equally horrific attacks,” Roberts says.\nNonetheless, Roberts is convinced that Churchill would have recognized and sympathized with Israel’s position today.\n“He was a Zionist. He didn’t subscribe to [the] antisemitism that so many of the people of his age, class and background did. He was a supporter of the Balfour Declaration and believed that the ‘Judeo’ side of Judeo-Christian civilization… gave Christianity its ethics and its positive moral angle,” he says.\nRoberts says that Churchill’s daughter had once warned him never to assume what the former prime minister would have said about any event after his death in 1965, but he is happy to wager an opinion.\n“It strikes me as very clear that he would have been as outraged as any other decent, rational, logical human being about what had happened on October 7, and he would certainly have been in favor of a terrible punishment raining down on Hamas,” Roberts says. “He was a humanitarian and so he’d have wanted to have minimized the civilian casualties in Gaza, and I believe that the IDF have done that to the best of their ability.”\nPerhaps, like Roberts, Churchill would also have seen a commonality between the enemy he defeated and that which Israel faces.\n“The overlap between Hamas ideology and Nazi ideology is so well colored in on the Venn diagram”\n“The overlap between Hamas ideology and Nazi ideology is so well colored in on the Venn diagram,” Roberts says.\nOf course, he adds, it is always “difficult and dangerous” to draw direct historical analogies. Hamas’s murderous rampage cannot be compared with the industrial-scale killing carried out by the Nazis, even if the former wore GoPro cameras and broadcast their “monstrous actions” on Facebook while the latter tried to cover up their crimes and destroy the gas chambers in 1945.\n“The analogy between Hamas and the Nazis strikes me as completely obvious one,” Roberts says. “I think you’d have to be deliberately obtuse not to see the connections.”\nThe Hamas attacks of October 7 and the ensuing conflict have confirmed Roberts’s belief that launching a war is a “profoundly immoral” act.\n“Wars are truly terrible things, which is why you shouldn’t start them,” he says, “and why you should fight them in as humanitarian a way as you can, which I think is what Israel has done.”", "date": "Today, 9:31 am", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/chair-of-uk-oct-7-report-denial-started-while-the-massacres-were-still-ongoing/", "type": "article"}

{"title": "Leo XIV, first American pope, studied under pioneer in Jewish-Catholic relations", "content": "JTA — Cardinal Robert Prevost, who was elected as Pope Leo XIV on Thursday, studied under a pioneer in Jewish-Catholic relations when he attended seminary in Chicago.\nRev. John T. Pawlikowski, who taught for nearly half a century at the Catholic Theological Union until his retirement in 2017, served as co-founder and director of the school’s Catholic-Jewish Studies Program and also served four terms on the board of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.\nMore than 40 years after Leo’s ordination as a priest, Pawlikowski remembers the new pope as a good student with an open mind.\n00:00 / 23:33\n“I do remember him as a pretty bright student,” Pawlikowski said in an interview shortly after his former student was introduced to the world as the sitting bishop of Rome.\nPawlikowski added later, “My experience of him was he’s a very open-minded person who’s very much in the context of Vatican II.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nVatican II, or the Second Vatican Council, inaugurated a new era in Jewish-Catholic relations in 1965 when it issued a document, Nostra Aetate, repudiating antisemitism and stating that the Jewish people were not responsible for Jesus’ death. Ties between the two religious communities were blossoming at the time when Leo was studying for the priesthood in the late 1970s and early ‘80s.\nUnder Pawlikowski, Leo studied Catholic social teaching, which focuses on social and economic issues. Pawlikowski says relations with Jews are relevant to that field. CTU has also had a commitment to Catholic-Jewish relations since its founding and launched its formal program in the field in 1968.\nPeople hold up a US flag as the newly elected Pope Leo XIV appears at the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican, May 8, 2025. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\n“I’ve always argued that antisemitism is something that has to be counted as part of the Catholic commitment to social justice and human dignity,” he said. “My work on Catholic social teaching did include always the issue of antisemitism.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe pope spent much of his career in Peru and is thought of as a relative centrist and Vatican insider. He hasn’t been a prominent figure in Jewish-Catholic dialogue or fighting antisemitism, and doesn’t appear to have commented publicly on Israel or the war in Gaza, sparked by the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, assault. Pope Francis, his predecessor, did opine on those issues and had relations with Jewish leaders in his native Argentina.\nBut Leo’s coming of age in the era of Vatican II — plus his roots in Chicago, which has a large Jewish community, also leads Rabbi Noam Marans, the American Jewish Committee’s director of interreligious and intergroup relations, to feel optimistic.\n“He studied at CTU under John Pawlikowski and in the post-Nostra Aetate era, in the country where Catholic-Jewish relations are preeminent,” Marans said in an interview. “An American pope bodes well for the future of Catholic-Jewish relations. More than anywhere in the world, the relationship between Catholics and Jews has flourished and set a gold standard in the United States.”\nWhile Francis was outspoken in his opposition to antisemitism and his promotion of ties with Jews, he raised the ire of some Jewish leaders in recent years for his criticism of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. One of his last acts as pope was to donate his popemobile to Gaza as a mobile medical unit.\nPope Francis flanked by Rabbi Riccardo Di Segni, right, during his visit to the Great Synagogue of Rome, Sunday, Jan. 17, 2016. (AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino)\nPawlikowski said he believes “there’s a desire to carry on” with Catholic-Jewish relations, though he added, “the situation in Israel and Gaza has had a dramatic effect.”\nWill his former student begin a new chapter in Catholic-Jewish ties? Pawlikowski said it’s too soon to tell, given that Leo has not thus far focused on the issue.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“He hasn’t really been stationed in any area where there was a really pronounced Jewish community,” he said. “On the question of interreligious [affairs], he’ll have to show us where he is, but I would assume he had an outgoing, positive attitude generally.”\nIn his first address as pope, Leo issued a call to dialogue.\n“Help us as well — help one another — to build bridges through dialogue, through encounter, uniting everyone to be one single people always in peace,” he said.\nRabbi Joshua Stanton, associate vice president for interfaith and intergroup initiatives at the Jewish Federations of North America, saw that as a sign that the pope is committed to Catholic-Jewish relations. He noted that this year is Nostra Aetate’s 60th anniversary, which he hopes Leo commemorates in an active way.\n“I’m very hopeful that he referenced the importance of dialogue and reaching out beyond the Catholic Church to other religious communities,” Stanton said. Stanton noted that Leo has a reputation for “quiet efficacy,” and as he settles into his position, Stanton said he’ll be looking at how the pontiff acts.\n“Does he invite Jewish leaders to the Vatican to meet with him?” he said. “Does he invite leaders from other traditions? Does he try to bring multiple groups together at the same time?”\nThe focus of Leo’s address on Thursday was peace. With war raging in Gaza, Marans did not take that as a specific reference to the Middle East.\n“All popes want peace,” he said. “May I add, all Catholics, Jews, rabbis want peace.”", "date": "Today, 1:27 am", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/leo-xiv-first-american-pope-studied-under-pioneer-in-jewish-catholic-relations/", "type": "article"}

Three have died,” without providing additional details.\nAsked whether Israel was disappointed in Trump’s commenting on the sensitive issue and contradicting Israel’s official number at the time, the PMO told The Times of Israel: “We very much welcome President Trump’s and the American people’s commitment to the security and the safety and the ongoing future of this country. We see eye to eye in every single way. There is no daylight between our two governments because we coordinate all of our actions together.”\nTrump’s comments sent shockwaves through the families of the hostages, who demanded on Wednesday that they be provided with any updated intelligence on their loved ones.\nAmid the resurgent worry over the hostages’ status, Haaretz also revealed Wednesday that in a military document outlining plans for a new Gaza offensive, the IDF had ranked the return of the hostages as its least important objective.\nThe document, presented to commanders on Tuesday, placed the Hamas-held captives in sixth and last place, a fact incongruent with army officials’ previous assertions to the Israeli public that the return of the hostages was the IDF’s most important war goal.\nADVERTISEMENT\nProtesters in Habima Square in Tel Aviv on May 3, 2025, call for elections now and for the release of all the hostages.

(Maya Alleruzzo/AP)\nOther parents of hostages also expressed their frustration at the situation and demanded clarification from the authorities.\nNetanyahu said late Wednesday Israel was confident that 21 of the 59 remaining hostages are still alive but that there was “doubt” about three others. An Israeli official said the three, whom he did not identify, are considered alive until there is evidence proving otherwise. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIf there is “new information being kept from us, give it to us immediately,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an advocacy group, said Wednesday.\nSome 5,600 Hamas-led terrorists killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 251 during their invasion of southern Israel on October 7, 2023. Elkana Bohbot and dozens of others were grabbed from a music festival, where more than 300 people were slaughtered.\nIsrael responded with a military offensive to destroy Hamas, topple its regime, and free the hostages.\nThe Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 50,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though the toll cannot be verified and does not differentiate between civilians and fighters.\nIsrael says it has killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.\nIsrael’s toll in the ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza and in military operations along the border with the Strip stands at 416.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsraeli hostage Elkana Bohbot speaks in a Hamas propaganda video issued on March 29, 2025. (Screenshot: Telegram)\nHamas has published three videos of Elkana Bohbot in the past months which were filmed under duress. In the most recent video, from mid-April, Elkana holds a fake telephone conversation with his wife, Rivka; their son, Re’em; his mother; and his brother — pleading with them to help him get out of Gaza.\nWhile the videos were a sign of life, Bohbot knows that they don’t guarantee that her son is still alive. Hearing the government’s approval this week to expand operations in Gaza deepened her concern about the fate of her son and the other hostages. Israel is “failing so utterly” to rescue the hostages, she said.\nIsrael’s decision to freeze all humanitarian aid likely meant her son also wasn’t getting food, she said. Humanitarian aid is the primary food source for 80 percent of Palestinians in Gaza, the World Food Program said in its monthly report for April, though that figure has likely risen in the past month.\n“I just want to imagine that he’s holding on and that he’s okay for now, that’s my hope and that’s my belief right now,” she said.\nIsrael stopped allowing aid into Gaza on March 2 after the first phase of a ceasefire and hostage release deal ended, leading many organizations to warn of severe malnutrition and hunger in Gaza. Jerusalem argued that Hamas diverted much of the aid that entered during the six-week truce, but said that the 650 trucks per day were enough to feed the population for an extended period. Israel says it won’t allow food, fuel, water, or medicine into the territory until it puts in place a system giving it control over the distribution.\nThe IDF reportedly plans to transition away from wholesale distribution and warehousing of aid and to instead have international organizations and private security contractors hand out boxes of food to individual Gazan families, according to Israeli and Arab officials familiar with the matter.

Half of the nation won’t accept this, and therefore the only way to do this is to get away from these two entities,” the Ynet news site quoted Netanyahu as saying during a meeting with reserve soldiers at the Tzeelim training base in southern Israel.\nThe premier then reportedly raised his voice and banged on the table, adding, “You think someone here really knows what happened? Each time I discover interesting things.”\nDespite Netanyahu’s assertion, polls have consistently shown an overwhelming majority of Israelis support a state commission of inquiry into October 7, including a survey last month that found 75 percent of Israelis back such a commission.\nThe ongoing war was triggered by the Hamas invasion, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 abducted as hostages to Gaza.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nFollowing the meeting with reservists, Netanyahu said in a video posted to Instagram that the most important thing was to investigate “the truth” and “everyone,” but added he was searching for an “alternative” to an independent state commission of inquiry and a government commission of examination.\nIsraeli soldiers walk near Sderot’s police station that was overrun by Hamas terrorists during the October 7 onslaught, on October 8, 2023.

Another idea is that a Knesset supermajority of 80 MKs will determine the [committee’s] composition,” he said.\nCritics say Netanyahu is seeking to establish a panel with fewer powers than a state commission and with representatives of his own choosing because he fears a state commission — which would typically be headed by a retired Supreme Court justice — would implicate him in the disaster. A state commission is the body that enjoys the broadest powers under Israeli law, including the authority to subpoena witnesses.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA governmental commission of examination has narrower powers than a state commission and is seen as more political since its members are appointed by the government.\nOn Monday, the government decided to seek to establish a “special” commission to probe the devastating Hamas-led invasion, but rejected a call from Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara for an official state commission of enquiry, which would have the broadest powers, Hebrew media reported.\nAt present, the members of a state commission of inquiry are appointed by the Supreme Court president, but several cabinet members have made hostile comments regarding current president Amit, and said the chair of the commission who appoints its members should be approved by a two-thirds majority in the Knesset, Channel 12.\nAlmost 19 months after the onslaught, the government hasn’t said what sort of inquiry it supports, and hasn’t taken any steps to form one.\nPresident Isaac Herzog and Supreme Court President Isaac Amit at a swearing-in ceremony for 35 new judges at the President’s Residence in Jerusalem, April 10, 2025.

{"title": "Ben Cohen of Ben & Jerry’s goes on Tucker Carlson and says, ‘I love Jesus Christ’", "content": "JTA — Four years ago, when the founders of Ben & Jerry’s took to The New York Times to defend their creamery’s West Bank settlement boycott, the opening of their op-ed read, “We are the founders of Ben & Jerry’s. We are also proud Jews.”\nFor at least one of them, that may have changed.\nBen Cohen, the Ben of the pair, appeared on Tucker Carlson’s talk show this week, mostly to discuss his opposition to US involvement in the Ukraine war and the Pentagon’s sprawling budget, issues where his long-touted progressive ideals can overlap with Carlson’s far-right ones.\nThen, at the end of the hour-long show, Carlson asked Cohen about his “spiritual beliefs.”\n“In terms of a spiritual belief, I mean, I don’t practice a religion,” Cohen responded. “I was born a Jew. I love Jesus Christ. I think the words that he said are wonderful, are amazing. And, you know, I’m kind of distressed that a lot of organized Christian religions are not really, I don’t know, abiding by the words of Jesus Christ.”\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nHe added, “I think if we could follow the words of Jesus Christ and think about the Sermon on the Mount and, you know, take his words seriously, we wouldn’t be doing the stuff we’re currently doing.”\nThe Sermon on the Mount, in the New Testament Gospel of Matthew, is a series of widely known sayings in which Jesus outlines his moral vision.\nCohen’s religious inclinations are significant because Carlson is known for inviting antisemites, including a Holocaust revisionist, onto his show in the past. They are also important because Cohen and his co-founder Jerry Greenfield publicly marshaled their Judaism in defense of their company’s 2021 boycott.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe boycott drew widespread opposition from centrist and right-leaning Jewish groups, a wave of state-level legal challenges and led to a court battle that lasted years. Cohen and Greenfield — who grew up attending Hebrew school together on Long Island — sold the company to Unilever decades ago and no longer control it, though recently Cohen was reportedly planning a buyback.\n“That we support the company’s decision is not a contradiction nor is it anti-Semitic,” the pair wrote in the Times op-ed. “In fact, we believe this act can and should be seen as advancing the concepts of justice and human rights, core tenets of Judaism.”\nLater, they added, “As Jewish supporters of the State of Israel, we fundamentally reject the notion that it is anti-Semitic to question the policies of the State of Israel.”\nThe Carlson show, posted on Monday, also raises questions about whether Cohen would still identify as a supporter of Israel. The bulk of the interview was about Ukraine and the US defense budget, but near the end, when discussing why he thinks “we’re kind of headed toward war” in Iran, Cohen brought up Israel.\n“There seems to be some kind of strange relationship between Israel and the US, where, I don’t know, Israel now has the US supplying weapons for its genocide,” Cohen said. “And what I’m told is that Israel wants some concept of greater Israel. I mean, I don’t really know much about that.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n(The term “greater Israel” has generally referred to Israeli control of territories such as the West Bank and Gaza, rather than its regional conflict with Iran.)\nIn response to a subsequent question, he said, “Right now what it means to be American is that we are the world’s largest arms exporter, we have the largest military in the world, we support the slaughter of people in Gaza, if somebody protests the slaughter of people in Gaza, we arrest them. What does our country stand for?”\nThis is not the first time this year that Cohen has accused Israel of genocide in its war against Hamas in Gaza, a charge the country strenuously rejects. In March, he said, “The US supporting this genocide is essentially trampling on the soul of America,” and added, “It’s not a war, it’s a slaughter. I don’t think there’s much difference between somebody getting killed by a bomb or getting killed by being thrown in a gas chamber.”\nIn the interview on Monday, Carlson did not address Cohen’s statements on Israel. He seconded Cohen’s praise of Jesus.\nCohen has also recently begun promoting a website to back DOGE, the Elon Musk-run operation that has rapidly slashed parts of the federal government, including large global humanitarian programs. A request for comment via that website, which Cohen touts on his X account, was not immediately returned.", "date": "8 May 2025, 4:57 pm", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/ben-cohen-of-ben-jerrys-goes-on-tucker-carlson-and-says-i-love-jesus-christ/", "type": "article"}

The revelations sparked criticism of the prize committee from Israel’s Foreign Ministry and a call for the prize to be rescinded.\n“These are not word games – they are outright denials of documented atrocities,” Damari wrote in a letter to the prize board posted on X Thursday. “You claim to honor journalism that upholds truth, democracy, and human dignity. And yet you have chosen to elevate a voice that denies truth, erases victims, and desecrates the memory of the murdered.”\nDamari, a 28-year-old civilian with Israeli and British citizenship, was shot and taken from her Kfar Aza home on October 7, 2023. She was released on January 19 this year as part of a ceasefire deal, emerging without two fingers, which had been shot off during the attack.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nPosting online days later, Abu Toha falsely portrayed her as a soldier and appeared to attempt to legitimize her being “detai[n]ed” by Hamas.\nEmily Damari (right) and her mother, Mandy, hold a video call with family members after her return from Hamas captivity, January 19, 2025. (IDF)\n“How on earth is this girl called a hostage? (And this is the case of most ‘hostages). This is Emily Damari, a 28 UK-Israeli soldier that Hamas detailed [sic] on 10/7,” he wrote on Facebook on January 25, alongside an old video clip in which she was seen in uniform. “So this girl is called a ‘hostage?’ This soldier who was close to the border with a city that she and her country have been occupying is called a ‘hostage?’”\nOn May 6, Abu Toha edited the post slightly, changing “most hostages” to “some hostages.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn a separate post in early February, he posted a picture of Agam Berger, a surveillance soldier taken captive on October 7 and released as part of the same January deal, calling her and others “killers who join the army and have family in the army!” while criticizing international media for “humaniz[ing]” them.\nMourners gather to pay their respects next to a makeshift memorial for Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on February 26, 2025. (Ahmad Gharabli / AFP)\nHonest Reporting also noted that Abu Toha aimed fire at the BBC in February for reporting on Israel’s findings that Ariel and Kfir Bibas, who were respectively 4 years old and nine months old at the time of their abduction, had been murdered by their captors’ bare hands.\n“If you haven’t seen any evidence, why did you publish this. Well, that’s what you are, filthy people,” he wrote.\n“Mosab Abu Toha is not a courageous writer,” Damari wrote Thursday. “He is the modern-day equivalent of a Holocaust denier. And by honoring him, you have joined him in the shadows of denial. This is not a question of politics. This is a question of humanity. And today, you have failed it.”\nThere was no immediate comment from Abu Toha.\nA spokesperson for the Pulitzer committee told Fox News online that “the selection process for each award is based on a review of submitted works.”\nOn Wednesday,  Foreign Ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein posted online that the prize for Abu Toha was “shameful.”\n“Apparently, attacking young Israeli women who were brutally kidnapped by Hamas, can get you the @PulitzerPrizes— at least when it comes to @MosabAbuToha,” he wrote.\nIsrael’s consul general in New York, Ofir Akunis, told Fox News that the posts should sicken decent people.\nPalestinian poet Mosab Abu Toha speaks to online news show ‘Democracy Now!’ about Israel’s offensive in the Gaza Strip, January 22, 2024.

Let it be a tale,” quoting the poem of Palestinian author Refaat Alareer, who was killed in December 2023 by an Israeli strike on Gaza.\nHe went on to list dozens of members of his family who were killed by airstrikes in Gaza, which has been devastated by the war.\nThe war in Gaza was triggered on October 7 when Hamas led over 5,000 terrorists to invade southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Attackers also abducted 251 people who were taken hostage to Gaza. Of those, 59 remain captive in the Strip, including the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the Israel Defense Forces.\nAbu Toha was detained by the IDF in November 2023 and briefly held.

All three were taken from the Nova music festival in southern Israel during Hamas’s October 2023 invasion of Israel.\nThey were held in Gaza by Abdallah Aljamal, according to the lawsuit and the IDF.

Aljamal, his wife Fatima and his father Ahmad Aljamal were all killed during the hostage rescue mission.

All three were “terrorized” during their captivity, subjected to arbitrary punishment, physical threats, and physical and psychological abuse, the lawsuit said.\nThe outlet’s tax-exempt status means US taxpayers were subsidizing Hamas propaganda published to a US audience, the lawsuit argues, adding that the salary he was paid also helped him imprison the hostages.", "date": "Today, 12:54 am", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-judge-says-theres-reason-to-believe-us-based-nonprofit-aided-hamas/", "type": "article"}
{"title": "Coalition revives contentious bid to limit Law of Return; this time, it may pass", "content": "The government is again debating a contentious change to the Law of Return that would deny people with only one Jewish grandparent the automatic right to immigrate to Israel.\nThe proposal, which was made previously in late 2022 and early 2023 and was featured in coalition deals ahead of the formation of the current government, is expected to pass this time as it enjoys sufficient support from coalition members, according to Hebrew media reports.\nAvi Maoz, head of the far-right Noam Party, proposed the amendment to the law in a heated Knesset session Wednesday, days after parliament reconvened from a monthlong recess. It is set to be discussed again in two months.\n00:00 / 23:33\nThe Law of Return was formulated in 1950, two years after the State of Israel was established, giving every Jew from around the world the automatic right to immigrate to the Jewish State. “Every Jew has the right to come to this country as an oleh [immigrant],” it states.\nFor years, lawmakers disagreed on how to define exactly who is considered a Jew for this purpose. While Orthodox religious authorities traditionally only recognize as Jewish those who have a Jewish mother, or those who converted to Judaism in an Orthodox court, the law was expanded in 1970 to also allow any grandchild of a Jew to immigrate, even if they themselves are not Jewish.

The change would wreak havoc for new immigrants from Russia, where the majority of new olim have come from in recent years, of whom many are not considered Jewish according to religious law.\nThe law as it currently stands “allows it to be exploited by many who have severed all ties with the Jewish people and their traditions, and in effect empties the law of its original intention,” Maoz’s proposal states. Repealing the grandchild clause would “prevent one of the greatest absurdities in the Israeli law book — that the most explicit Jewish law gives sweeping permission for non-Jews to enter the country’s gates,” he wrote.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDebating the proposal in the Knesset, the United Torah Judaism party’s Deputy Transportation Minister Uri Maklev charged that the law currently allows for religious fraud. “There could be a person who goes to church every Sunday with his parents, who comes and says he wants to enter as a Jew.”\nCommunications Minister Shlomo Karhi (Likud) added that the purpose of the 1970 amendment was to provide a haven for anyone persecuted for being Jewish. “No one dreamed that complete gentiles would come for economic purposes, like the kind that [Yisrael Beytenu MK Avigdor] Liberman brings, who receive a package of benefits and then return home after two days.”\nYisrael Beytenu party chair Avigdor Liberman leads a faction meeting at the Knesset in Jerusalem, on December 16, 2024 (Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)\nLiberman shot back, arguing that real Jews serve in the IDF, unlike many in the ultra-Orthodox community.\n“7,000 soldiers whose father or grandfather were Jewish stood up for the country, fighting and defending us, and dozens of them fell in the Iron Swords War,” he wrote on X, using the IDF’s official name for the current war. “In their actions, they proved that they are much more Jewish than any draft-evader who harms Israel’s security.”\nDemocrats MK Gilad Kariv accusing Karhi of being a “racist,” posting on X that “the contribution of 1.2 million Russian-speaking Israelis to Israel’s society, to national security, and to Judaism is priceless. It is dozens of times greater than the contribution of this group of hatred, division and incitement, of which Karhi is one of the leaders.”\nYesh Atid MK Vladimir Beliak, a Russian-born immigrant, also responded harshly.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Forty immigrant soldiers from the former Soviet Union were killed in the war, and over 400 were injured,” he wrote on X. “At least 18 immigrant citizens were killed, and five were kidnapped in Gaza. The Hamas terrorists did not ask under which article they immigrated to Israel. None of this prevents Karhi from slandering the immigrant community.”\nMost coalition parties are expected to vote in favor of rescinding the grandchild clause when it is brought back for debate in two months, according to a report by the public broadcaster Kan.

However, the IDF itself told the newspaper that there was “no definitive determination regarding the identity of the individual responsible for the shooting.” The army also passed along a message from the Scagio family requesting that reporters not name the captain.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBecause the IDF found the shooting had been accidental, no prosecution was ever opened and the shooter was not named publicly.

The Trump administration, which has taken a slash-and-burn approach to spending and sought to cut off many recipients of federal funding for ideological reasons, on Friday proposed eliminating the National Endowment of the Arts entirely.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\n“The NEA is updating its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation’s rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the President,” an email from the NEA to at least some grant recipients sent Friday night after the budget proposal. “Consequently, we are terminating awards that fall outside these new priorities.”\nThe rescissions leave Jewish and other groups uncertain about how they will cover their expenses. Some have already budgeted for or even spent the latest grants, anticipating receiving the awards they had been promised.\nWinitsky said he saw the cuts as a direct attack on groups that might undercut the administration.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“This is enormously concerning,” he said. “It may feel like a small amount of money — $207 million for the United States government is a tiny amount of money, and it is one of many chaotic policies that are being rolled out right now. But it is well proven over human history that when powerful people try to control the message of arts and culture, what they are trying to do is control people.”\nThe Jewish Plays Project was initially awarded $20,000 from the NEA, which, in addition to other grants and donations, covers things like artist fees and pay for actors, directors and stage managers, for people working on several plays across the country. All of that federal grant money is now gone, said Winitsky, who is hoping local governments can help fill the gap.\nExterior of the Jewish Museum in New York City, June 13, 2019. (Ajay Suresh/ CC BY 2.0/ Wikimedia commons)\n“It remains to be seen whether we get funding from New York City and New York State,” Winitsky said. “I don’t think it will affect this year, but will those organizations either offer direct funding or step in, or maybe even have to supplement their own budgets, from the state or local level to supplement federal funding that’s gone? We don’t know yet.”\nOther New York Jewish organizations and institutions that receive NEA funding include the Jewish Museum, which was set to receive $50,000 to fund its current exhibit, “Queen Esther in the Age of Rembrandt.” Reached Monday afternoon, a representative from the Jewish Museum could not confirm whether the grant had been revoked.\nThe rescissions come as the Trump administration advances an agenda focused in part on what it says are efforts to fight antisemitism. The NEA email received by grantees said the administration would continue to support “projects that elevate the Nation’s HBCUs and Hispanic Serving Institutions, celebrate the 250th anniversary of American independence, foster AI competency, empower houses of worship to serve communities, assist with disaster recovery, foster skilled trade jobs, make America healthy again, support the military and veterans, support Tribal communities, make the District of Columbia safe and beautiful, and support the economic development of Asian American communities.”\nAnything else would be cut off, the email said, adding that grantees could appeal within seven days “if [they] believe [their] project meets one of the agency’s new priorities.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nWinitsky said he thinks the Jewish Plays Project will appeal the decision. But he said the new funding priorities set forth in the email were confusing and “don’t really add up to a cohesive strategy at all,” and he emphasized that his initiative would not be swayed in its mission.\n“If somebody asks us to change what we are doing to meet somebody else’s priorities or somebody else’s vision, we’re not going to do that,” Winitsky said.\nFor Yugntruf, the initial $10,000 grant marked the first government funding received for its work. The grant was intended to support the publication of “Hanka: The Ghetto Queen Sings at Night,” a bilingual English-Yiddish edition of Jacob Pat’s children’s book “Haneke,” the true story of a teenager imprisoned in the Bialystok Ghetto during the Holocaust who became the youngest member of the city’s underground resistance movement.\nThe grant was meant to go to various freelancers in support of production costs for the book’s layout and design, archival research, a cartographer and editing. Jacob Pat’s great-granddaughter, Anita Galler, is the English translator.\n“It’ll be harder, but we’ll publish it,” said Jordan Kutzik, Yugntruf’s chair. “We’ll make up the money. We’re in a better position than a lot of other organizations who’ve had this funding cut.”\nKutzik said he did not see the NEA grants as “targeting any particular demographic” but said they did not make sense to him.\n“It’s odd to see them saying a Yiddish-English children’s book about the Holocaust doesn’t reflect the American artistic culture,” he said. “The Holocaust is part of the American story, because a million Americans are descendants of Holocaust survivors. The author we’re publishing was a refugee from the Holocaust who wrote this book for an American audience.”\nAdditionally, funding for the City Parks Foundation, which operates SummerStage, the annual public summer festival held in Central Park that features a lineup of Yiddish music, was rescinded. This year’s “New York Sings Yiddish” show, scheduled for June 30, includes performances from conductor and artistic director of the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene Zalmen Mlotek and Frank London’s Klezmer All Stars.

{"title": "Risk of natural gas shortage will push up electricity prices, budget chief warns", "content": "Israel is poised to face a natural gas shortage in the next 25 years as domestic energy needs are growing faster than forecasted and gas export sales are robust, the finance ministry warned.\n“Israel’s energy sector faces significant challenges in terms of both energy security and the competitive landscape,” the Finance Ministry’s budget department said in a position paper released Thursday. “Looking ahead, for the first time [since the discovery of Israel’s large offshore gas reserves], a structural shortage of natural gas for domestic use is expected in the next 25 years.”\nA shortfall would lead to higher electricity prices for consumers, according to the Finance Ministry’s budget division, led by Yogev Gradus. That is because more than 70% of Israel’s electricity is generated from domestic natural gas production. Gradus urged the government to revise its current policy for retaining natural gas for domestic use so as to ensure the country’s energy independence for the coming decades.\n00:00 / 23:33\nIn the position paper sent to Israel’s Energy Ministry and other ministries, Gradus called on the government to update the current quantity of 440 billion cubic meters of natural gas reserved for domestic use to 515 BCM for Israel to meet the growing domestic energy needs of households and businesses in the next 25 years.\nThe Treasury argued that since the last update on the gas reserve policy for domestic use, the deployment of renewable energy in the country has been slower than expected, and the infrastructure for storage of natural gas has not been established, while gas export sales are continuing to rise.\nSign up for the Tech Israel Daily\nand never miss Israel's top tech stories\nNewsletter email address\nSUBSCRIBE\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nIsrael was supposed to generate 10% of its energy from renewables by 2020, but only reached 9.2% at the end of 2022. If current trends continue, only 19% of energy would be generated by renewable sources by the end of the decade, compared with an official goal of 30%.\nTamar natural gas field off the coast of Israel. (Courtesy)\nSince Israel first discovered large natural gas fields off its Mediterranean coast more than a decade ago, the country has emerged as a gas exporter. Its natural gas operations have put it on a path to energy independence — and have shielded it from the worst of the energy crisis sparked by the Russian war on Ukraine this year — in a region with few natural resources.\nThe Leviathan natural gas field, the nation’s largest, started pumping on December 31, 2019, after natural gas started to flow in 2013 at the nearby Tamar, the second largest field. Tamar holds some 10 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of natural gas, half of the quantity held in Leviathan.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIsrael has been exporting gas from the Tamar field to Jordan since January 2017, and the Leviathan field started exports to Egypt in January 2020. The Leviathan deals are considered to be bigger and more significant for the economy.\nAmid the ongoing war with the Hamas terror group in Gaza, natural gas exports to Egypt and Jordan increased by more than 13% in 2024 year-on-year. Overall, natural gas production was up 8.3% in 2024, and state revenue collected from gas royalties soared almost 11% to NIS 2.37 billion ($670 million).\nIn June 2022, Israel, Egypt and the European Union signed a memorandum of understanding that will see Israel export its natural gas to the bloc for the first time. According to the agreement, Israeli gas will be supplied via Egypt’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants to the European Union.\nIn the report, the finance ministry’s budget department also warned about the high concentration in the local gas market, citing the cross-ownership of US energy giant Chevron in Israel’s largest gas reservoirs. Chevron operates and holds a 25% stake in the Tamar gas field, and a 39.66% stake in the Leviathan gas reservoir.\nWorkers on the Israeli ‘Tamar’ gas processing rig, 24 km off the Israeli southern coast of Ashkelon. (Moshe Shai/FLASH90)\n“This concentration poses a risk to price levels, energy security and the long-term competitiveness of the economy,” according to the position paper. “Putting the operations of essential gas infrastructure in the hands of a single entity, without a substantial competitive alternative, creates a captive market in which consumers have no real ability to negotiate or secure fair prices over time.”\n“This concentration could lead in the near term to an increase in gas prices and, as a result, lead to higher electricity prices,” it added.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn the position paper, the ministry called on the government to take structural steps to reduce concentration in the domestic gas market.\nOne of the recommendations is to consider, from 2030, limiting holdings to no more than one rig that produces gas in Israel, if these holdings constitute more than 80% of the gas reserves in the economy.\nIn response, the Energy Ministry said that it seeks to “secure the supply of natural gas to the economy at the lowest price, and the right way to do this is through the discovery of additional reserves, the entry of new international companies, and creating competition.”\n“We are closely monitoring natural gas prices in the Israeli economy and we will use all the tools at our disposal to secure price levels without being dragged into the misguided steps put forward by the Finance Ministry, that will drive away international companies, prevent the discovery of new reserves and result in price increases,” the Energy Ministry said. “Unfortunately, the position paper is not in line with reality and does not take into account recently signed contracts.”\n“Similarly, predictions about an expected shortage of natural gas are unfounded and create unnecessary panic,” the ministry said.", "date": "8 May 2025, 9:14 pm", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/risk-of-natural-gas-shortage-will-push-up-electricity-prices-budget-chief-warns/", "type": "article"}

{"title": "Upstate NY legal battle underlines Hasidic community growing pains", "content": "NEW YORK — New York State Attorney General Letitia James came out in support of federal intervention in a dispute over a Jewish housing development in the Catskills region, in a local conflict that has highlighted ongoing growing pains for Hasidic communities around New York City and alleged antisemitism in small towns.\nJames issued a warning to officials in the town of Forestburgh who have allegedly blocked Hasidic Jews from building homes in the community. She called the allegations “profoundly disturbing” and said that, if proven true, the claims would violate the federal Fair Housing Act.\n“Discrimination on the basis of religion, race, national origin, or other protected characteristics — whether explicit or cloaked in pretext — is not only illegal but fundamentally un-American,” she wrote in a letter on Monday that backed a federal statement of interest in the case, one of several similar disputes in the tri-state area.\n00:00 / 23:33\nThe defendants’ legal team responded in a letter to James’s office, saying that the town agreed with James’s support for religious liberty and housing non-discrimination, but that her characterization of the case was “inaccurate or incomplete.”\nThe dispute stems from a 2022 civil lawsuit filed in the federal Southern District of New York court against the town of Forestburgh, its zoning board, and several town officials. The plaintiffs are Lost Lake Holdings and Mishconos Mazah, companies owned by Hasidic Jews.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe two companies said they had bought land for a development in 2020. The previous owner, who was not Jewish, had obtained approval to build more than 2,600 residential units at the 3.3-square-mile site. The town board had described that development as a “wonderful project” and local residents backed the non-Jewish company, the lawsuit said. The rural town has a population of around 900.\nThe company failed to carry out the construction project, and the two Jewish companies bought the site. After local officials realized Hasidic Jews had acquired the land for development, the town set up a series of obstructions to prevent construction. Local officials and inspectors denied building permit applications, conducted an illegal search of the property, over-assessed the value of the site to drive up taxes, issued stop-work orders, and adopted a local law that imposed a 1,000% increase in fees, among other measures, the lawsuit alleged.\nIllustrative: This picture taken on April 5, 2019 shows shows two Jewish men hitchhiking during a rainfall in a Jewish neighborhood of Monsey in Rockland County, New York. (Johannes Eisele/AFP)\nInternal emails cited by James and federal officials suggested anti-Jewish discrimination played into the obstruction.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Don’t be scared about the Hasidic threat — we’re energized and have the cash to fight and make their lives miserable,” a local official said in an email, according to the federal attorneys.\n“Bloomingberg was asleep: we’re on amphetamines,” the email said, in an apparent reference to disputes between local officials and the Hasidic community in the nearby town of Bloomingburg.\nIn another email, a local resident wrote to town officials, “Their sect is notorious for mysogyny and child abuse,” and warned of “their wanton destruction of the towns and school districts.”\n“They take over, like locusts — killing everything they encounter, draining every last resource,” the email said. The town board planning chair forwarded the email to unknown recipients, saying, “I too have been thinking strategy about how to prevent Lost Lake from overwhelming this town,” according to the federal statement.\nTown officials were pushed by local residents who opposed the development, the plaintiffs said. Local social media groups and articles about the development were flooded with antisemitic comments. In some of the online comments cited by the lawsuit, area residents decried “dirty money” from the “Jewish mafia,” and said, “You wonder why Germans did what they say they did.”\nThe defendants’ lawyers responded to James in a Wednesday letter that a town official shared with The Times of Israel.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA local zoning law that James has said may illegally discriminate against religious land use had been misinterpreted, the town said. Places of worship are permitted throughout the town, subject to restrictions similar to those applied to non-religious buildings, in rules that are more permissive than in other local communities, the letter said.\nThe email about the “Hasidic threat” was from 2015, written by someone who was a private citizen at the time, and related to a fraud case in Bloomingburg, the letter said.\n“The Town categorically denies that any of its land use actions were based on the religious identity of the developer or potential homebuyers,” the town said.\nThe back-and-forth this week was the second exchange between the town and the attorney general’s office. Last year, James’s office warned the town that the rezoning ordinance “discriminates against Jewish New Yorkers” by illegally limiting religious land use. The town’s lawyers said that interpretation of the law appeared “to be based on a selective or incorrect factual record,” pointing to similar zoning rules for other buildings. The rules were put in place to keep development at a low density “to preserve the rural character of the Town,” the letter said.\nThe defendants have also disputed that the companies, and the property’s previous owner, had approval to build a large housing development. The development plans were “inconsistent with and materially different” from previous approvals, a town official said in a legal filing.\nThe thwarted plans have caused the developers significant financial damage and effectively stripped them of the property. The lawsuit seeks compensation, declarations of wrongdoing and to overturn the obstructions.\nThe US government weighed in on the case in March because of its interest in enforcing federal law, and because of US President Donald Trump’s January 2025 executive order on combating antisemitism, the Department of Justice said. The department also weighed in on the case in 2023.\nJames’s Monday letter supported the federal intervention, saying, “Your engagement in this matter sends a powerful message that no individual or community is above the law — and no community is beyond its protection.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Together, we must affirm the principle that government decisions must be based on law and evidence — not bias, fear, or bigotry,” James said, according to a copy of the letter James’s office shared with The Times of Israel.\nForestburgh is located in Sullivan County in the Catskills region, around a two-hour drive northwest of Manhattan.\nThe Satmar Hasidic village of Kiryas Joel. (JTA/Uriel Heilman)\nThe lawsuit illustrated ongoing disputes between Jewish and non-Jewish residents in areas surrounding New York City, as Jews move out of the city due to housing pressure. The disputes have exposed alleged antisemitism that takes place in quiet small town bureaucracy, away from the widely publicized discrimination occurring in forums like street protests and on college campuses, and unconnected to the Gaza war. The opposition is motivated by both generic resistance to community change and development, and anti-Jewish animus.\nThe Catskills region has a celebrated Jewish history stretching back more than a century. The so-called “Borscht Belt” drew throngs of Jewish visitors to the Catskills in the mid-1900s and has had a lasting impact on American culture, particularly in stand-up comedy. The Borscht Belt declined as antisemitism waned and Jewish tourists traveled elsewhere, contributing to an economic downturn in the region. Jews have launched efforts to revive the memory of the Borscht Belt in recent years with comedy shows, a museum and public placards.\nJewish camps and getaways are scattered across the region, many Jews have summer homes in the area, and there are several recently built Orthodox Jewish developments in the areas around Forestburgh.\nDespite warm memories of the Borscht Belt, a series of fires at the former hotels has given rise to antisemitic conspiracies.\nIn 1974, Hasidic Jews established the town of Kiryas Joel in Orange County, bordering Sullivan County. Hasidic expansion in that town and others in the area has sparked repeated disputes between Jewish and non-Jewish residents. In the small towns, growing Hasidic communities can fundamentally change the composition of the local population, leading to conflicts over control of local government and schools.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn addition to referring to Bloominburg, opponents of the development in Forestburgh repeatedly mentioned Kiryas Joel, according to the lawsuit. A town fire department official told the plaintiffs that residents feared the Hasidic “bloc vote,” comparing the situation to Kiryas Joel. Local reports about the development also drew comparisons, with comments warning of “Kiryas Joel part 2” and calling that community dirty, the lawsuit said.\nJames’s letter acknowledged that pattern, saying Orthodox Jews “too often faced bias masked as bureaucratic decision-making in matters of zoning, housing, and land use.”\nUsing zoning laws and land use regulations against Jews “recalls a dark history” that appears to be “reemerging in the 21st century,” James said.\nNew Jersey has seen similar conflicts, with local governments feuding with Jews over schools, zoning laws and a cemetery, including in recent weeks.", "date": "8 May 2025, 6:49 am", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/upstate-ny-legal-dispute-underlines-ongoing-hasidic-community-growing-pains/", "type": "article"}

A much smaller fraction of Israeli Jews said spirits could be found in objects or in nature, beliefs that are not central to traditional Judaism.\nUnlike in some Christian denominations, where a belief in the afterlife is an organizing idea, Judaism has no single doctrine about what happens after death.

The IDF is prepared for any mission,” Katz said in a statement early Thursday morning.\nHe added that Iran, which is accused of funding and arming the Houthis, would also be targeted, saying an array of other Iranian proxy groups that had targeted Israel since war in Gaza broke out with Hamas’s October 7, 2023, assault had “collapsed.”\n“I also warn the Iranian leadership that funds, arms and operates the Houthi terror organization… You are directly responsible. What we did to Hezbollah in Beirut, Hamas in Gaza, to Assad in Damascus and the Houthis in Yemen, will also be done to you in Tehran,” Katz stated, in comments that echoed previous US threats.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nThe statement came after Israel carried out two days of heavy sorties targeting infrastructure controlled by the Houthis in response to a missile that struck Ben Gurion airport on Sunday. The fiery reprisals destroyed the international airport in the capital Sanaa, and caused heavy damage to a port in Hodeida and a cement factory, officials said.\nHouthis, who have repeatedly fired missiles and drones at Israel throughout the war, most of which have been shot down, vowed to retaliate.\nOn Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces said a missile fired by the Houthis crashed outside of Israeli territory. Earlier in the day, the IDF said it downed a drone that may have been launched from Yemen.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDefense Minister Israel Katz at the Knesset in Jerusalem, April 24, 2025.

(Mark Schiefelbein/AP)\nLocated over 2,000 miles from Yemen, Israel has limited capability to carry out strikes and put military pressure on the Houthis, with Jerusalem relying heavily on US support throughout the war. Analysts expressed concerns Wednesday that a halt to US military action would allow the terror organization to regroup while continuing to attack Israel.\nOfficials have also privately expressed concern about US nuclear talks with Tehran hobbling potential Israeli military action against the Islamic Republic.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBut Katz indicated Thursday that Israel need not rely on support or backing from Washington.\n“Israel must be capable of defending itself on its own against any threat or enemy. That was true in the past and will be in the future,” he said.\nFirefighters douse a burning plane with water at the Sanaa International Airport on May 7, 2025. (Mohammed HUWAIS / AFP)\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of the leading Trump loyalists in Congress, indicated Wednesday that Israel would be on its own in defending itself from attacks by Iran and its proxies.\n“As to the Houthis continuing to attack Israel — they do so at Iran’s own peril. Without Iran, the Houthis do not possess the capability to attack America, international shipping or Israel,” Graham wrote on X. “To my friends in Israel, do what you have to do to protect your airspace and your people. It is long past time to consider hitting Iran hard. It wouldn’t take much to put Iran out of the oil business.”\nKatz’s statement appeared to echo recent threats from the Trump administration that had warned of military action against Iran should the Houthi attacks continue.\nIsraeli Air Force fighter jets takeoff for airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen, May 5, 2025.

{"title": "Ex-hostage Damari decries Pulitzer given to Gazan writer who legitimized their abduction", "content": "A former hostage held in Gaza for over 500 days said Thursday she was in “shock and pain” after a Gaza-born writer who appeared to justify her abduction and denigrated other captives on social media was awarded the Pulitzer Prize this week.\nMosab Abu Toha, a Palestinian currently living in the United States, won the prestigious journalism honor in the “commentary” category Monday for essays published in The New Yorker magazine.\nBut in social media posts flagged by pro-Israel watchdog Honest Reporting, Abu Toha had written disparagingly of Emily Damari and another female hostage and cast doubt on the brutal murder of the two young Bibas children after they and their mother were abducted by Gazan terrorists. The revelations sparked criticism of the prize committee from Israel’s Foreign Ministry and a call for the prize to be rescinded.\n“These are not word games – they are outright denials of documented atrocities,” Damari wrote in a letter to the prize board posted on X Thursday. “You claim to honor journalism that upholds truth, democracy, and human dignity. And yet you have chosen to elevate a voice that denies truth, erases victims, and desecrates the memory of the murdered.”\nDamari, a 28-year-old civilian with Israeli and British citizenship, was shot and taken from her Kfar Aza home on October 7, 2023. She was released on January 19 this year as part of a ceasefire deal, emerging without two fingers, which had been shot off during the attack.\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nby email and never miss our top stories\nNewsletter email address\nGET IT\nBy signing up, you agree to the terms\nPosting online days later, Abu Toha falsely portrayed her as a soldier and appeared to attempt to legitimize her being “detai[n]ed” by Hamas.\nEmily Damari (right) and her mother, Mandy, hold a video call with family members after her return from Hamas captivity, January 19, 2025. (IDF)\n“How on earth is this girl called a hostage? (And this is the case of most ‘hostages). This is Emily Damari, a 28 UK-Israeli soldier that Hamas detailed [sic] on 10/7,” he wrote on Facebook on January 25, alongside an old video clip in which she was seen in uniform. “So this girl is called a ‘hostage?’ This soldier who was close to the border with a city that she and her country have been occupying is called a ‘hostage?’”\nOn May 6, Abu Toha edited the post slightly, changing “most hostages” to “some hostages.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn a separate post in early February, he posted a picture of Agam Berger, a surveillance soldier taken captive on October 7 and released as part of the same January deal, calling her and others “killers who join the army and have family in the army!” while criticizing international media for “humaniz[ing]” them.\nMourners gather to pay their respects next to a makeshift memorial for Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on February 26, 2025. (Ahmad Gharabli / AFP)\nHonest Reporting also noted that Abu Toha aimed fire at the BBC in February for reporting on Israel’s findings that Ariel and Kfir Bibas, who were respectively 4 years old and nine months old at the time of their abduction, had been murdered by their captors’ bare hands.\n“If you haven’t seen any evidence, why did you publish this. Well, that’s what you are, filthy people,” he wrote.\n“Mosab Abu Toha is not a courageous writer,” Damari wrote Thursday. “He is the modern-day equivalent of a Holocaust denier. And by honoring him, you have joined him in the shadows of denial. This is not a question of politics. This is a question of humanity. And today, you have failed it.”\nThere was no immediate comment from Abu Toha.\nA spokesperson for the Pulitzer committee told Fox News online that “the selection process for each award is based on a review of submitted works.”\nOn Wednesday,  Foreign Ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein posted online that the prize for Abu Toha was “shameful.”\n“Apparently, attacking young Israeli women who were brutally kidnapped by Hamas, can get you the @PulitzerPrizes— at least when it comes to @MosabAbuToha,” he wrote.\nIsrael’s consul general in New York, Ofir Akunis, told Fox News that the posts should sicken decent people.\nPalestinian poet Mosab Abu Toha speaks to online news show ‘Democracy Now!’ about Israel’s offensive in the Gaza Strip, January 22, 2024. (Screen capture: YouTube/Democracy Now! used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)\n“These posts are an absolute disgrace and this man should be condemned for his comments, not given a Pulitzer Prize,” he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn its announcement of the prize Monday, the Pulitzer committee praised Abu Toha, 32, for his “essays on the physical and emotional carnage in Gaza that combine deep reporting with the intimacy of memoir to convey the Palestinian experience of more than a year and a half of war with Israel.”\nHonest Reporting, which charged that other posts by Abu Toha criticized Israel in ways that crossed into antisemitism, called for the prize to be rescinded.\n“The Pulitzer Prize is the top award in journalism and should not be blemished by bestowing it to a man who repeatedly twisted facts,” Honest Reporting executive director Gil Hoffman said in a statement. “Abu Toha justifies abducting civilians from their homes, spreads fake news, and calls lighting a Menorah on Hanukkah antisemitism.”\nAccording to the watchdog, Abu Toha’s online rhetoric met the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism.\nIt pointed out posts in which Abu Toha referred to Israeli troops as “terror soldiers” and compared Israel’s military campaign in Gaza to the Holocaust.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCritics of the IHRA definition, which has been widely, but not universally, adopted in the West, say it is overly broad and stifles legitimate criticism of Israel.\nAbu Toha was also accused of echoing Hamas propaganda after he posted last month about the bombing of the al-Ahli hospital in November 2023, which the terror group blamed on Israel, despite evidence produced by the Israel Defense Forces and backed by the US showing that the Gaza City hospital had been hit by an errant rocket fired by the Islamic Jihad terror group.\nA cursory scan of Abu Toha’s recent social media feeds by The Times of Israel also uncovered posts in which he accused Israel of killing hostages held by terror groups in Gaza, disparaged calls for their release, urged the international community to take military action against Israel, and called for activists and others to “escalate” actions against the Jewish state.\nOn Tuesday, he said online that his account had been suspended from Facebook but swiftly restored, with a Meta spokesperson commenting that the suspension had been a mistake.\nReacting to the Pulitzer win online Monday, Abu Toha posted, “Let it bring hope. Let it be a tale,” quoting the poem of Palestinian author Refaat Alareer, who was killed in December 2023 by an Israeli strike on Gaza.\nHe went on to list dozens of members of his family who were killed by airstrikes in Gaza, which has been devastated by the war.\nThe war in Gaza was triggered on October 7 when Hamas led over 5,000 terrorists to invade southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Attackers also abducted 251 people who were taken hostage to Gaza. Of those, 59 remain captive in the Strip, including the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the Israel Defense Forces.\nAbu Toha was detained by the IDF in November 2023 and briefly held. His arrest quickly sparked Western media attention, as he had been contributing pieces to The New Yorker and other major outlets since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, painting a dire image of its toll on civilians through personal experience.", "date": "8 May 2025, 2:13 pm", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/former-hostage-decries-pulitzer-given-to-gazan-writer-who-legitimized-abduction/?utm_campaign=most_popular&utm_source=website&utm_medium=article_end&utm_content=4", "type": "article"}

Many of those gathered there were unarmed when they realized that terrorists had infiltrated the base and were throwing grenades inside the shelter.\nBrando and many others — including Staff Sgt. Benyamin Belay, Staff Sgt. Or Asto, Staff Sgt. Yogev Aharon and Staff Sgt. Teshager Taka — were slain in the battle.\nBrando was buried on October 11 in Beersheba. He is survived by his parents, Hector and Nelia Luz, and his two older sisters, Susan and Mirella.\nBorn in Pucallpa, Peru, his family moved to Israel in 2017, when Brando was 14. They settled in an absorption center in Beersheba, and Brando — who had played soccer in a number of different clubs in Peru and stood out for his talent — quickly picked up the sport again in Israel.\nHe was soon spotted by the Maccabi Beersheba team which invited him to join their roster. Brando enlisted in the army in 2021 in a special track to enable him to continue playing soccer for the Maccabi Beersheba professional team.\nNir Barad, who coached the team, told a sports news site that “when Brando joined the club he couldn’t say more than two words in Hebrew. Brando was an incredible example to all his friends of everything connected to generosity and solidarity. He always put the team’s success above his own personal success… The Maccabi Beersheba club salutes you and promises that your approach and your spirit will always be the one the club adopts.”\nBrando’s aunt, Judith Flores, told a Peruvian news outlet that she and her nephew “always talked. He would call me and tell me about his day on the military base, he was happy.” Judith said Brando was exploring his post-army options, and “he really liked soccer. Since he arrived [in Israel] he had been in several clubs and had many friends. He was a few months away from finishing and he told us that he wanted to be a policeman. He had always wanted to be a policeman.”\nOn what would have been his 22nd birthday, his girlfriend, Sharon Knap, wrote on Instagram that she was “so grateful that you came into my life to show me what real love was, to teach me how to love, to give and to receive.”\n“With you, things were so beautiful and calm, my love.

{"title": "Alex Dancyg, 75: Renowned Holocaust educator was ‘wise and witty’", "content": "Alex (Olesh) Dancyg, 75, was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7 and brought to Gaza. In July 2024, the IDF confirmed that Alex had been killed in the Strip.\nIn August 2024, his body was recovered from a tunnel in Khan Younis along with the bodies of five others — Yagev Buchshtav, Nadav Popplewell, Avraham Munder, Chaim Peri and Yoram Metzger. An IDF investigation determined that the six were shot dead by their captors in mid-February 2024.\nAlex was buried in Kibbutz Nir Oz on August 25, 2024. He is survived by his four children, Yuval, Matti, Ben and Lee, and many grandchildren.\nBorn in Warsaw, Poland, in 1948, to Holocaust survivors Nina and Marcin, Alex moved to Israel with his parents and older sister, Edith, in 1957. He was a member of the left-wing Labor Zionist youth group Hashomer Hatzair, served in the IDF in the Paratroopers Brigade and eventually settled in Nir Oz, where he raised four children with his then-wife, Rachel and was involved in the kibbutz’s agriculture.\nAlex got a degree in history from Ben Gurion University and worked as a history teacher until a trip back to Poland in 1986 — for the first time since he had left in 1957 — kindled a keen interest in Holocaust history and education. In 1990 he began working with the Yad Vashem Museum at the Education Ministry to train guides for youth trips to Poland and Polish educators, clergy and police officers, and became a world-renowned Holocaust historian and expert in the field, including writing several books.\nIn a video of a talk he gave not long before his death, Alex described himself: “I am born in Poland, a Polish kid, the son of survivors of the Holocaust in Warsaw, and other places, son of a historical family of great rabbis from Vilna, and I am culturally poor… a Jew with deep roots and an Israeli patriot. Is it possible? Yes. I want the kids to understand that life is complicated.”\nInbal Kvity Ben-Dov, an executive at Yad Vashem, wrote in an online tribute about their shared “funny, moving, irritating, and educational moments — memories of the fiery redhead you were, even when your hair turned white. We experienced ups and downs in our joint work, and you were always wise and witty, charismatic and articulate, knowledgeable, yet also grumpy and irritable, and perpetually hungry. Not just for a good meal, drink or some salted nuts, you were hungry for a new survivor’s testimony, a captivating book to discuss for hours, for new experiences, and for challenging philosophical ideas.”\nAfter his death was announced, his son Yuval wrote on Instagram that “this isn’t how it was supposed to end.”\n“You were abducted alive and breathing from your bed on that cursed morning, and you should have returned home alive and in one piece. I’m sorry we didn’t succeed in this task,” wrote Yuval. “In the last few months, I was exposed more and more to the number of people you inspired and to what an amazing legacy you left behind. I promise to carry this legacy with me to every place and to tell your story.”\nFollowing the retrieval of Alex’s body, his son, Matty told the Kan public broadcaster that his father was “one of the founders” of the now widely accepted trips for Israeli youth to Poland in high school.\n“He dedicated much of his life to this, he worked for many years with Yad Vashem, he established a lot of dialogue with groups of Polish Jews, tried to explain the point of view of Polish citizens in a more accurate and historical and less stereotypical way,” said Matty. At the same time, Alex worked in agriculture in the kibbutz, where he lived for more than 50 years, he said.\n“He was a very smart guy, very warm, loved his family, he was the person I had the most fun speaking with, he had so much knowledge, and he was always very interesting,” he added. “I miss him so much… it’s important to me that the legacy he worked to instill, of Holocaust education and nuanced history will continue.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.", "date": "8 January 2025, 9:42 pm", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/alex-dancyg-75-renowned-holocaust-educator-was-wise-and-witty/", "type": "article"}

When he realized what was happening, he gathered the 18 other soldiers on base in the bomb shelter and organized a plan of action.\nFrom inside the shelter, Raz began firing at the Hamas gunmen inside the base, until he was hit in his arm and had to switch hands. He later charged out of the shelter to engage in a closer-range battle with the gunmen and was shot and killed.\nRaz was slain that day alongside six of his soldiers: Staff Sgt.

When the rocket fire began, Ziv texted her father about what was happening, but said she was fine and, “Don’t tell Mom anything.” Several hours later, Ziv texted her mom from Lin’s phone saying: “Mom, we’re in a terror attack, I love you.”\nThat was the last anyone heard from either Ziv or Lin, who were considered missing for close to a week. The inseparable best friends were buried side by side in Kibbutz Ein Hamifratz in back-to-back funerals on October 15.\nZiv is survived by her parents, Daniel and Reuven (Ruvik), and her younger siblings Omri, 19, and Maya, 12.\nShe loved to travel, saving highlights of her recent destinations — Athens, Sinai, Mexico, Colombia, Ecaudor, Guatemala, Panama and more — on her Instagram page. After her mandatory service, which she completed in the police force, Ziv went on a five-month trip abroad to South America with Lin. They returned in May 2023 and she started to work as a waitress at the Roots restaurant in Acre. She was planning to work for a year and save up before starting studies in accounting in 2024.\nOn a memorial site, her parents described her as a “kind and moral girl, with cascading hair, shy and skinny, who grew up and became a girl full of self-confidence, who was always surrounded by friends. She would protect the weak and fight for them stubbornly, a warrior for justice who didn’t allow anyone to harass them,” they wrote, recalling how in high school she led a fundraising effort to give a gift card to the school janitor to buy new clothes. “She filled the lives of those around her with joy and light.”\nHer younger brother, Omri, wrote to “my Ziv, my big sister, my role model, my inspiration. You always were and always will be my big sister, whose life was cut short at 22.”\n“If you can hear me from up there, I want you to know that my love for you has no bounds,” he added. “You always knew how to be there for me, to worry about me, to write to me. Every time I was at work until late you would get annoyed and call or text me asking where I am. Only now, sadly, have I learned to appreciate all the little things you did for me, that you supported me, listened to me, knew how to say the right thing.”\nHer boyfriend, Niv Gavriel, wrote online that the couple had a “fairy tale love story.”\n“We met at work, she was the most beautiful waitress I’d seen in my entire life. I’ll never forget the moment I entered the restaurant and saw her, and life just stopped, for five minutes I couldn’t take my gaze off her,” he wrote. “And since then, for four years, the only thing I wanted was to see her smile.”\nFor the past four years, he wrote, “Ziv made sure to show me how good the world is through her perspective, how important it is to be with family and to check up on them, how important it is to listen to others no matter who they are, and how important it is to know how to forgive because everyone deserves a second chance.”\nHer family said they were struggling to come to terms with her brutal murder so close to home.\n“Ziv was a talented girl, a champion who achieved every goal she set for herself in the best way,” her mother, Daniel, told a local news outlet, noting that she received an award for excellence while serving in the police during her mandatory IDF service. “She was an athlete and hardworking.

The attack claimed the lives of over 360 people.\nThe whereabouts of the couple remained shrouded in uncertainty, as their names did not appear on any list of casualties or Hamas abductees. Toward the end of October, Matías’s family confirmed his murder, while Einav’s fate remained unknown. It later emerged that they had been killed while in the custody of the terrorists on October 7.\nMatías and Einav are survived by their two daughters, aged 9 and 12. The family lived in Karmiel, located in northern Israel. Fanny Burstein, Matías’s mother, recounted the painful task of gradually breaking the news to the young girls, explaining what she called “a problem” at the party and preparing them for the difficult reality of not seeing their parents again. Fanny shared these heartbreaking details with Infobae, a news portal in Argentina.\nThe last image captured of Matías before his capture by Hamas was a poignant moment preserved on an unknown individual’s cell phone camera. The brief snapshot shows Matías in a black sweater and shorts, passionately expressing himself in Hebrew amid a traffic jam on a road in the Negev desert.\nMatías and Einav were fleeing the chaos of the electronic party, situated just a few kilometers from the Gaza Strip, as gunshots echoed in the background. In his desperation, Matías reached out to a friend, his voice filled with alarm, to relay the news of the Hamas attack.\nMatías arrived in Israel as a child in 1989, at the age of 7, with his parents, Pedro and Fanny, and his 4-year-old sister, Yamila. The family had made aliyah to escape the hyperinflation crisis in Argentina during the late 1980s. Fanny reflected on their decision, noting that although other options like Spain or the US were available, their unwavering commitment to Israel as a Zionist family had guided their choice.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.
