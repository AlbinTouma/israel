He was the first high-profile protester to be arrested under Trump’s campaign to expel foreign students who participated in pro-Palestinian advocacy.Just this week, Farbiarz appeared poised to order Khalil’s release, on the basis that his detention under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was unconstitutional.That law stipulates that the secretary of state – in this case, Marco Rubio – has the power to remove foreign nationals who have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”. But Farbiarz ruled that Rubio’s use of the law violated Khalil’s freedom of speech.Still, the Trump administration filed additional court papers saying it had another reason for wanting to deport Khalil.It alleged that Khalil, a permanent US resident, had omitted information from his green-card application that would have otherwise disqualified him from gaining residency.The Trump administration has long accused Khalil of supporting terrorism through his protest-related activities, something the former graduate student has vehemently denied.In the case of his green-card application, it argues that Khalil failed to disclose his work with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), a humanitarian organisation. Politicians in Israel and the US have accused UNRWA of ties to the armed group Hamas, an allegation reportedly made without evidence.Khalil, however, has denied he was ever an “officer” in UNRWA, as alleged. Instead, his legal team points out that he completed a United Nations internship through Columbia University.The Trump administration also argues that Khalil did not accurately identify the length of his employment with the Syria Office of the British Embassy in Beirut. Khalil and his legal team, meanwhile, say he accurately identified his departure date from the job as December 2022.Judge Farbiarz had set Friday morning as a deadline for the Trump administration to appeal Khalil’s release on bail. But that deadline was extended to give the government more time to challenge Khalil’s release.Ultimately, Farbiarz allowed the Trump administration to continue its detention of Khalil. He advised Khalil’s lawyers to seek release on bail from the immigration court where his deportation trial is being held in Louisiana.Farbiarz had been weighing a separate habeas corpus petition from the Khalil team that called into question the constitutionality of his continued detention.Marc Van Der Hout, a lawyer for Khalil, told the Reuters news agency that immigration fraud charges are exceedingly rare, and the Trump administration’s use of such charges was simply a political manoeuvre to keep Khalil in lock-up.“Detaining someone on a charge like this is highly unusual and frankly outrageous,” said Van Der Hout. “There continues to be no constitutional basis for his detention.”Another lawyer representing Khalil, Amy Greer, described the new allegations against his green-card application as part of the government’s “cruel, transparent delay tactics”. She noted that Khalil, a new father whose child was born in April, would miss his first Father’s Day, which falls this Sunday in the US.“Instead of celebrating together, he is languishing in ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] detention as punishment for his advocacy on behalf of his fellow Palestinians,” Greer said in a statement.“It is unjust, it is shocking, and it is disgraceful.”","Judge rules Mahmoud Khalil can remain in custody amid green card dispute","2025-06-28T09:08:56.697879Z"

In exchange, some sanctions were lifted from Iran.While the deal was lauded as an achievement of diplomacy, Israel disapproved of the JCPOA. Ten years later, the US and Iran appeared interested in striking another similar deal.The former ostensibly did not want to get dragged into a regional war as tensions mounted across the Middle East, while the latter was again looking for much-needed sanction relief.But Israel’s strikes on Iran, which were reportedly planned months in advance and with US approval, have scuttled any diplomatic solution in the short term, said Akbari.“It’s hard to imagine that someone in the shoes of Iran’s supreme leader [Ali Khamenei] is not taking the side of hardliners after this,” he told Al Jazeera.In response to Israel’s strikes, Iran has launched drones and ballistic missiles at Israel, with some hitting targets on the ground.In the past, Iran’s deterrence against external aggression relied primarily on its self-described “Axis of Resistance”.The axis consisted of powerful armed groups across the region, such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, as well as Syria under former President Bashar al-Assad.However, Hezbollah’s capabilities were degraded significantly during the peak of its recent war with Israel, which lasted from September to late November last year.Al-Assad’s fall in December, the culmination of a more than decade-long civil war in Syria, also compromised Iran’s ability to resupply Hezbollah through Syria, as it used to do.Trump is now exploiting Iran’s weakness by urging it to capitulate to a deal that would see it give up its nuclear programme, said Michael Stephens, an expert on regional response to Iran’s nuclear programme with the Royal United Service Institute (RUSI), a defence think tank.On Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social that Iran must make a deal before there is “nothing left” of the country and that the next Israeli attacks will be even “more brutal”.Later that evening, Israel carried out more air strikes on Iran’s military sites and nuclear facilities.“There are no good options for [Iran] really,” said Stephens.“Either Khamenei … orders his negotiators to compromise on the nuclear file or … he holds firm [and] more sites are hit and further targeted assassinations of high-level officials take place,” he told Al Jazeera.“Either way, if Iran decides to sprint towards a bomb, it’s going to be very, very difficult to do that now,” he added.Despite Iran’s military weakness compared with the US and Israel, it is wary of giving up its nuclear programme, analysts told Al Jazeera.Negar Mortazavi, an expert on Iran with the Centre for International Policy (CIP), said Iranian officials have long referred to the fate of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who agreed to give up his nuclear weapons programme in exchange for US sanction relief in 2003.The deal came after the US President George W Bush had launched his so-called “War on Terror” after the September 11, 2001, attacks, which led to the invasion and prolonged occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.At the time, Bush warned his partners and foes in the region that they were either “with us or against us”.Eight years after Gaddafi gave up his nuclear programme, the US backed a pro-democracy uprising in Libya, which spiralled into an armed rebellion and led to Gaddafi’s overthrow and eventual death.“The [Libya] scenario is something that Iran has taken notice of, and they don’t want to go down that path,” Mortazavi explained.She added that Iran may likely pull out from the JCPOA and try to quickly expand its nuclear programme in reaction to Israel’s ongoing assault.“Just how far and how soon Iran will expand its nuclear programme is unclear,” Mortazavi told Al Jazeera.","Israel strikes may make Iran more determined to pursue nuclear programme","2025-06-24T20:01:45.696205Z"

Protesters intended to camp near the border before returning to Cairo on June 19.However, Egyptian police stopped several groups of foreign nationals en route, forcing vehicles to pull over roughly 30km (20 miles) from Ismailia, just outside the Sinai. Activists said police ordered passengers with non-Egyptian passports to disembark, blocking their passage to Rafah.Paul Murphy, an independent Irish member of parliament, who has travelled to Egypt to take part, said in a post on X, “We have had our passports confiscated and are being detained. It seems Egyptian authorities have decided to crack down on the Great March To Gaza.”Mo, a member of the protest march from the Netherlands, said that his group had headed in taxis to Ismailia, but that at a checkpoint near the city foreigners were told to hand over their passports, with only Egyptians allowed through. He also described riot police who came to clear the road of protesters.Now back in Cairo, Mo and the group from the Netherlands are deciding what to do next.“We are trying to regroup,” he told Al Jazeera. “A lot of our group is splintered, some have been beaten up by the police… so they’re coming back battered and bruised and broken.”“It seems like the Egyptian authorities are determined to stop us from reaching anywhere near the border.”Security sources told the Reuters news agency that at least 88 individuals had been detained or deported from Cairo airport and other locations across the country.Three airport sources told Reuters that at least 73 foreign nationals were deported on a flight to Istanbul for violating entry protocols, with about 100 more still awaiting deportation at the airport.Officials at Cairo International Airport said new directives were issued to airlines requiring all passengers travelling to Egypt between June 12 and 16 to hold confirmed return tickets, Reuters reported.Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said that any visits to the Rafah border area must be coordinated in advance with Egyptian embassies or official bodies, citing security concerns in the Sinai.Organisers of the march maintain they coordinated the trip with authorities and called on the government to release those detained.Separately, a land convoy known as “Soumoud”, which had departed Tunisia carrying activists from Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania, was stopped on Friday morning at the entrance to Sirte, a city in Libya under the control of forces loyal to military commander Khalifa Haftar.“The caravan was barred from passing through at the entrance to the city of Sirte,” Tunisian organiser Wael Naouar said in a video posted on Facebook.Naouar said the convoy needs Egyptian authorisation to reach Gaza but had received mixed messages from local security officials. “Some told us we could cross in a few hours. Others insisted that ‘Egypt has denied [passage] and therefore you will not pass,'” he said.On Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz ordered the military to block demonstrators from entering Gaza from Egypt, claiming people involved were “jihadist protesters”.“I expect the Egyptian authorities to prevent them from reaching the Egypt-Israel border and not allow them to carry out provocations and try to enter Gaza,” he added.It comes as Israel continues its relentless air strikes on Gaza, while severely restricting the flow of aid, including food, water, and medical supplies, as humanitarian experts warn that the enclave could fall into full-scale famine unless Israel lifts the blockade.","Egypt, Libya stop activists gathering for March to Gaza, organisers say","2025-07-15T20:39:10.051110Z"

They intend to join a convoy of activists that left Tunisia on Monday, travelling overland to support the action.The organisers say they aim to “create international moral and media pressure” to open the border crossing at Rafah and lift the aid blockade on Gaza, which the United Nations has described as “the hungriest place on Earth”.Israel imposed a total blockade in March as part of its war on Gaza, in which it has now killed more than 55,000 Palestinians. It allowed for a limited amount of aid to flow last month, but distribution has been plagued with problems, including deadly Israeli violence against aid seekers, and experts say the volumes are far below what is required.The Global March for Gaza is the second attempt by international activists to break the siege on Gaza this month, after the Madleen ship attempted to travel to the Palestinian territory by sea with aid on board.The ship, which had Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, French European Parliament member Rima Hassan, and Al Jazeera Mubasher reporter Omar Faiad on board, was seized by Israeli forces on Monday as it travelled through international waters.Egypt has denounced the restrictions on aid entering Gaza, and says that its side of the Rafah border crossing remains open, but that the Palestinian side has been blocked by Israel since the war broke out.Cairo has warned that only those with authorisation will be allowed to travel the planned march route.“Egypt holds the right to take all necessary measures to preserve its national security, including the regulation of the entry and movement of individuals within its territory, especially in sensitive border areas,” its foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.Israel, whose diplomatic ties with Cairo are a sensitive issue in Egypt, has called on Egyptian authorities to prevent the march from reaching the border.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz referred to the activists as “jihadist protesters” on Wednesday, saying their presence at the border “would endanger the safety of [Israeli] soldiers and will not be allowed”.","Egypt deports dozens of activists before planned march to Gaza border","2025-07-15T20:35:12.124809Z"

But it came short of ordering Khalil’s immediate release from detention.Instead, Judge Farbiarz gave the administration until 9:30am local (13:30 GMT) on Friday to appeal. After that point, Khalil would be eligible for release on a $1 bail.Nevertheless, the judge wrote that the administration was violating Khalil’s right to free speech by detaining and trying to deport him under a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. That provision allows the secretary of state to remove foreign nationals who bear “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”.Judge Farbiarz has previously signalled he believes that provision to be unconstitutional, contradicting the right to free speech.“The petitioner’s career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled,” Farbiarz wrote on Wednesday. “This adds up to irreparable harm.”Khalil was arrested on March 8 after immigration agents showed up at his student apartment building at Columbia University in New York City. After his arrest, the State Department revoked his green card. He has since been held at an immigration detention centre in Louisiana.The administration has accused Khalil, a student protest leader, of anti-Semitism and supporting Hamas, but officials have offered no evidence to support their claims, either publicly or in court files.Critics have instead argued that the administration is using such claims to silence all forms of pro-Palestine advocacy.Like other student protesters targeted for deportation, Khalil is challenging his deportation in immigration court, while simultaneously challenging his arrest and detention in federal proceedings.The latter is called a habeas corpus petition, and it asserts that the Trump administration has violated his civil liberties by unlawfully keeping him behind bars.While students in the other high-profile cases — including Mohsen Mahdawi, Rumeysa Ozturk and Badar Khan Suri — have all been released from detention as their legal proceedings move forward, a ruling in Khalil’s case has been slower coming.In April, an immigration judge had ruled that Khalil was deportable based on the State Department’s interpretation of the 1952 law, despite a written letter from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio providing no further evidence for the allegations made against him.Immigration judges fall under the executive branch of the US government and are generally considered less independent than judges in the judicial branch.Also that month, immigration authorities denied Khalil’s request for temporary release for his son’s birth.In the case before the New Jersey federal court, meanwhile, the Trump administration has argued that Khalil was not fully transparent in his green card application, something his lawyers deny. But Judge Farbiarz indicated on Wednesday that it was unusual and “overwhelmingly unlikely” for permanent residents to be detained on such grounds.","Judge rules Trump cannot use foreign policy claim to deport Mahmoud Khalil","2025-07-14T21:52:36.966094Z"

Gunfire follows, and soon the two brothers are lying dead.Nidal and his brother 35-year-old brother Khaled were the latest victims of Israel in the West Bank, after they were killed late on Tuesday.  Witnesses were adamant that the behaviour of the Israeli soldiers was an unnecessary escalation that led to the deaths of yet more Palestinians.Ghassan Hamdan, the director of the Palestinian Medical Relief Society in Nablus, was at the scene of the killings.“There were at least 12 soldiers and they all fired their automatic machine guns at once,” said Hamdan.After the two men fell to the ground [medics] asked the soldiers if we could treat their wounds. They answered by firing at all of us.”“We all took cover behind the walls of the old city,” he told Al Jazeera.Hamza Abu Hajar, a paramedic at the scene, said that the Umairah brother who had initially approached the Israeli soldiers had been trying to go to his house to move his family out and away from the Israeli raid.“They lifted his shirt up to prove he was unarmed,” Abu Hajar said. “They then started shooting at him, and at us as well.”The Israeli army said it acted in self-defence after one of the Umairah brothers tried to seize a weapon from a soldier. It said that four soldiers had been injured in the incident.The raid in Nablus, which lasted more than 24 hours, is the latest Israel has conducted in the West Bank.Israel has taken advantage of the world’s focus on its own war on Gaza since October 2023 to escalate its land theft and violence in the West Bank.During that span, Israel has killed at least 930 people in the West Bank, 24 of whom were from Nablus, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).Many of these deaths are the result of violent Israeli raids ostensibly aimed at clamping down on Palestinian fighters in the West Bank, but which have resulted in mass destruction and thousands of Palestinians fleeing their homes.According to Hamdan, Israeli troops mainly targeted Nablus’s old city by storming into hundreds of homes in the middle of the night. Dozens of people were also reportedly arrested.Young people in the city protested by burning tires and throwing rocks at Israeli troops, yet they were met with heavy tear gas, injuring at least 80 Palestinians in the raid.In the past, Palestinian protesters have been imprisoned on “terrorism” charges or shot and killed for simply resisting Israel’s occupation by throwing rocks or defying Israeli soldiers.This time around, the Israelis classified the entire old city in Nablus as a closed military zone for 24 hours. No ambulances or medics were allowed inside to aid distressed residents, said Hamdan.“Nobody was allowed in or out. Nobody was allowed to make any movement at all. We [as medics] could not enter the area during the entire raid to try and help people in need,” he told Al Jazeera.During the raid, Israeli troops stormed into several apartments after blowing off door hinges with explosives.Umm Hassan,* a 58-year-old resident who did not want to give her full name, recalls feeling terrified when several Israeli soldiers broke into her home.About five months ago, her husband passed away from cancer, an illness that also claimed two of her children years ago.Umm Hassan is also battling cancer, yet she said Israeli soldiers showed her no mercy.They flipped her television on the ground, broke windows and tossed her paintings off the walls and onto the living room floor.They even vandalised her books by throwing them on the ground, including the Quran.“I told them to leave me alone. I was alone and so scared. There was nobody to protect me,” Umm Hassan told Al Jazeera.Another woman, Rola*, said that Israeli soldiers stormed into her home two times in the span of six hours during the raid.When Israeli soldiers returned the second time, Rola said that they attacked her elderly father, hitting him on the head and chest with the butts of their guns.Rola described her three nieces and nephews – all small children – cowering with fear as Israeli soldiers vandalised and destroyed their home.“The second time they came to our home, they put us all in a room and we weren’t able to leave the room from 8am until 3:30pm,” said Rola.“We [Palestinians] always talk about being resilient. But the reality is when Israeli soldiers come into your private home, then you get very scared. It’s natural. We are humans and humans get scared,” she told Al Jazeera.More than 80 Palestinians received treatment from the Palestine Red Crescent Society during the raid, 25 of them as a result of gunshot wounds.While Israel says its raid was “precise”, inhabitants of Nablus say that the attack on the city was the latest attempt to intimidate and frighten Palestinians.“Honestly, what were Israeli soldiers searching for in my home? What did they think they were going to find?” asked Rola. “The reason for their raids [violence] is to uphold the [illegal] occupation.” Some names have been changed to protect sources from reprisal","Unarmed Palestinian brothers killed in Israeli raid on West Bank’s Nablus","2025-06-28T10:49:25.388034Z"

Khan was quoted as telling MEE on Monday that he had “no comment to make at this time”.Following the report’s publication, Labour Party MP Zarah Sultana said on X that Cameron “and every UK minister complicit in arming and enabling Israel’s genocide in Gaza” should be investigated.Scottish National Party MP Chris Law said the allegations were “shocking”, but added the country was “not seeing much better under Labour”.Bell Ribeiro-Addy, a Labour MP, called for an “independent inquiry into the UK’s role in the Gaza genocide”.Zack Polanski, the deputy leader of the Green Party, was cited by MEE as saying: “It’s been clear for all to see that both the former and current government have stood with the oppressors, not the marginalised.”When the ICC applied for the arrest warrants in May last year, the previous Conservative Party government, a strong backer of Israel, decried the move as “not helpful in relation to reaching a pause in the fighting, getting hostages out or getting humanitarian aid in”.In July, the new Labour government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, dropped the previous Rishi Sunak-led government’s bid to challenge the ICC’s power to seek the warrants, which were issued for Netanyahu, Gallant and three Hamas leaders in November.","UK MPs react to report alleging David Cameron ‘threatened’ ICC withdrawal","2025-06-28T10:40:06.974781Z"

United Nations Security Council members have overwhelmingly voted in favour of a ceasefire, a resolution blocked from passing only by a United States veto.But Israel, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is adamant in its refusal of any agreement that does not include what it calls the “defeat of Hamas”, even if that means endangering the Israeli captives still held in Gaza.“Hamas is already the weakest it’s ever been, and there’s nothing they can do that is remotely comparable to what Israel possesses,” writer and researcher on Israel-Palestine and founder of The Fire These Times podcast Elia Ayoub told Al Jazeera.“There’s ample evidence by now that the only reason this genocide is ongoing is because Netanyahu wants it to continue. It’s clearly just an excuse to keep the war going.”But why would Netanyahu want the war – which is Israel’s longest since 1948, and is causing economic crisis – to continue?One answer is that the war provides a distraction from Netanyahu’s own problems.Israel’s longest-serving prime minister has well-documented legal troubles; he is being tried for corruption.And, aside from that, should a permanent ceasefire be realised, some analysts believe Israeli society will hold Netanyahu accountable for security shortcomings that led to October 7.“He’s afraid once it’s done, eyes will rightfully turn to him over corruption and the failures of October 7,” Diana Buttu, a legal scholar and former adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization, said.And so, Netanyahu has two main tasks. The first is to prolong the war, allowing him to continue using it as an excuse to avoid accountability. The second is to prevent the breakup of his government, while somehow setting himself up for another successful election, which must happen before October 2026.Netanyahu has been “reliant upon Hamas throughout the war”, Mairav Zonszein, an expert on Israel and Palestine for the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera.“The far right and Netanyahu have consistently used Hamas as an excuse not to negotiate or plan for a day after,” she said.The Israeli refusal to negotiate a final end to the war stands in stark contrast to Hamas’s willingness to hand over all captives held in Gaza.Over the last 20 months, much of Hamas’s leadership has been killed. Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’s political leader, was assassinated in Tehran on July 31, and Yahya Sinwar, his successor, was killed in Gaza on October 16.Israel is now claiming it killed Sinwar’s successor and younger brother, Mohammed, though Hamas has yet to confirm his death.Militarily, analysts say, Hamas is estimated to have lost significant strength. It is still conducting some attacks, but fewer and further between than the ambushes it was able to carry out earlier in the war.In a sign that Hamas perhaps understands that it is no longer in a position to rule Gaza, it has also offered to step down from the administration of the Palestinian territory, which it has controlled since 2006, and hand over to a technocratic government.“The technocrat offer is not new,” Hamzé Attar, a Luxembourg-based defence analyst from Gaza, said.“It was on the table since before the invasion of Rafah [which occurred on May 6, 2024]. They want Hamas to give up their arms and give up everything, and Hamas has responded by saying: ‘We’re stepping aside.’”That has been firmly rejected by Israel, which has not endorsed any vision for post-war Gaza.Instead, over the last nearly 20 months, Israel has killed more than 54,300 Palestinians and wounded more than 124,000 in Gaza, according to the territory’s Health Ministry.In addition, Gaza is now “the hungriest place on Earth”, according to the UN, all its inhabitants at risk of famine after Israel strangled aid delivery throughout its war, then completely blocked it from March 2 until May 27.Israel has also turned 70 percent of the enclave into no-go zones.All the while, Israel’s bombing of Gaza continues.Discounting the pretext of destroying Hamas and returning the captives, some analysts believe there is a deeper goal: pushing Palestinians out of Gaza.“Neither Hamas nor the hostages are the targets,” Meron Rappaport, an editor at Local Call, a Hebrew-language news site, said.“The goal is to push the people of Gaza into very few, small and closed areas where food will be delivered scarcely, hoping that the pressure on them will get them to ask to leave the Strip.”“Israel is no longer fighting Hamas,” he added.Netanyahu said in late May that Israel would control the entirety of Gaza by the end of its latest offensive, while many foreign officials and experts have warned either directly or implicitly that Israel’s actions amount to ethnically cleansing Gaza.A recent report in Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper, cited 82 percent of Jewish Israelis supporting the expulsion of the people in Gaza.To do so would have a historic impact, Buttu said, one that Netanyahu might feel he can portray as protecting Israel from a Palestinian state – something he has repeatedly promised to prevent.“He recognises he will be the fall guy or the hero,” Buttu said. “If he is the one who ethnically cleanses Gaza, he becomes the hero.”Until that happens, analysts believe, Palestinians will continue to die at the hands of the Israeli military. Hamas is the pretext and their willingness to negotiate or succumb is of secondary importance.“Benjamin Netanyahu has no intention of ending this war,” Zonszein said. “It doesn’t matter what Hamas offers. They can offer to return all the hostages or give up governance.“This war is going to continue until Netanyahu is forced to stop it, and that can only come from Trump.”Additional reporting by Simon Speakman Cordall","‘Clearly an excuse’: Does Netanyahu really want Hamas gone?","2025-06-24T20:41:45.310582Z"

The Civil Defence teams are trying to retrieve bodies and rescue as many Palestinians as possible.”The Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesman Avichay Adraee announced the latest forced evacuation orders to neighbourhoods in northern Gaza, including northwest of Gaza City and Jabalia. Forces will “attack each zone used to launch rockets,” calling on residents to “immediately” move to the southern areas of the enclave, Adraee wrote on X Saturday.In the south of the besieged enclave, the Palestinian Red Crescent said al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis was “no longer accessible” after Israeli forces designated the surrounding area a “dangerous combat zone” and ordered evacuations.“There are many patients and medical staff in the hospital,” the group said in a statement, urging international organisations to intervene, provide protection for medical sites, and open safe corridors for aid and medical supplies.Among those killed in Israeli attacks today were eight people in a shooting incident near an aid distribution site west of Rafah in southern Gaza.Palestinians in Gaza have gathered at al-Alam roundabout near Rafah almost daily since late May to collect humanitarian aid, at a centre about 1km (0.6 miles) away, operated by the shadowy US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).Nearly 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire near these GFH sites since they were introduced.Samir Abu Hadid, who was there early Saturday, told the AFP news agency that thousands of people had gathered near the roundabout.“As soon as some people tried to advance towards the aid centre, the Israeli occupation forces opened fire from armoured vehicles stationed near the centre, firing into the air and then at civilians,” Abu Hadid said.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.The GHF had said on Friday that its aid centres would remain closed until further notice due to security concerns, just days after several deadly incidents near its aid hubs.“Operations at our distribution points have been paused until further notice,” a spokesperson for the GHF said on Friday, despite warnings from humanitarian agencies that the territory is on the brink of famine.Israel last month partially lifted a total blockade on humanitarian supplies entering Gaza that had been in effect since March 2, but rights groups and the United Nations have warned that only a trickle of aid has been allowed into the territory.The UN, which has refused to cooperate with the GHF over neutrality concerns, has warned that Gaza’s entire population of more than two million people was at risk of starvation.In Israel, Defence Minister Israel Katz announced that the military had recovered the remains of Thai national Nattapong Pinta from Rafah, southern Gaza.Pinta, an agricultural worker, was seized during the Hamas-led assault on October 7, 2023, from Kibbutz Nir Oz. Israeli officials said he had been held by the Mujahideen Brigades, a Palestinian armed group.His remains were found alongside those of two Israeli American captives retrieved earlier in the week. Pinta’s family in Thailand has been notified.","Israeli attacks in Gaza kill more than 70, including several near aid site","2025-07-14T21:32:39.253624Z"

US-based entities are also forbidden from engaging in transactions with them, including through the “provision of funds, goods or services”.The ICC quickly issued a statement in response, saying it stood behind its judges and “deplores” the Trump administration’s decision.“These measures are a clear attempt to undermine the independence of an international judicial institution which operates under the mandate from 125 States Parties from all corners of the globe,” the statement said.“Targeting those working for accountability does nothing to help civilians trapped in conflict. It only emboldens those who believe they can act with impunity.”In a fact sheet, the State Department explained that Bossa and Ibanez Carranza were sanctioned for authorising an investigation into US troops in Afghanistan in 2020, during Trump’s first term as president.Previously, the ICC had blocked a request to probe alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan, where the US had been leading a slow-grinding war from 2001 to 2021.But it reversed course the following year, granting a prosecutor’s request to investigate US forces and members of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for war crimes in “secret detention facilities” in Afghanistan and elsewhere.Afghanistan, the court noted, was a member of the Rome Statute, which includes the 125 countries where the ICC has jurisdiction.But the Trump administration at the time blasted the court’s decision, calling the ICC a “political institution masquerading as a legal body”. It has long argued that the US, which is not party to the Rome Statute, lies outside the ICC’s jurisdiction.Another country that is not a member of the Rome Statute is Israel, which has used similar arguments to reject the ICC’s power over its actions in Palestine.The second pair of judges named in Thursday’s sanctions — Alapini Gansou and Hohler — were sanctioned for their actions against Israeli leaders, according to the US State Department.The US is Israel’s oldest ally, having been the first to recognise the country in 1948. It has since offered Israel strong support, including for its ongoing war in Gaza, which has killed an estimated 54,607 Palestinians so far.Experts at the United Nations and human rights organisations have compared Israel’s military campaign in Gaza to a genocide, as reports continue to emerge of alleged human rights abuses.In November 2024, those accusations spurred the ICC to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who have both been accused of war crimes in Gaza, including intentional attacks on civilians.Alapini Gansou and Hohler reportedly took part in those proceedings.This is not the first time that the US has issued restrictions against an ICC official since Trump returned to office for a second term on January 20.Shortly after taking office, Trump issued a broad executive order threatening anyone who participates in ICC investigations with sanctions. Critics warned that such sweeping language could pervert the course of justice, for example by dissuading witnesses from coming forward with evidence.But Trump argued that the recent arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant necessitated such measures.He also claimed that the US and Israel were “thriving democracies” that “strictly adhere to the laws of war” and that the ICC’s investigations threatened military members with “harassment, abuse and possible arrest”.“This malign conduct in turn threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the United States Government and our allies, including Israel,” the executive order said.Under that order, the US sanctioned ICC prosecutor Karim Khan, who had petitioned the court for the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. That, in turn, slowed the investigation into Israel’s actions in Gaza, and Khan later stepped away from his role amid allegations of sexual misconduct.But Trump has a history of opposing the ICC, stretching back to his first term. In 2019, for instance, Trump announced his administration would deny or yank visas for ICC officials involved in investigating US troops in Afghanistan.Then, in 2020, he sanctioned ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and a court official named Phakiso Mochochoko for their involvement in the investigation. Those actions were later overturned under President Joe Biden.Critics, however, warn that Trump’s actions could have dire consequences over the long term for the ICC, which relies on its member countries to execute orders like arrest warrants. The court itself has called for an end to the threats.","Trump administration sanctions International Criminal Court judges","2025-06-28T10:42:28.614631Z"

Palestinian health authorities confirmed the deaths of four journalists.Gaza’s Government Media Office said the deaths raised the total number of journalists killed in Israel’s war on Gaza since October 2023 to 224.The attack comes as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) – a shadowy organisation backed by the United States and Israel – said it would open two two aid distribution centres in the war-torn territory on Thursday after a full-day closure on Wednesday.It said in a post on Facebook it would reopen two centres in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. It did not say when aid distribution would resume.The GHF earlier said its sites in Gaza would not open at their usual time due to maintenance and repair work and strongly urged aid seekers travelling to its locations to “follow the routes” set by the Israeli military to “ensure safe passage”.The Israeli military warned Palestinians on Wednesday not to approach GHF aid distribution sites while “reorganisation work” was under way, saying that access roads to those locations would be “considered combat zones”.The suspension of GHF’s distribution of food supplies in Gaza comes after Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinians seeking aid for a fourth time near a GHF distribution site in Rafah, southern Gaza, early on Tuesday.The Israeli attack killed at least 27 people and injured about 90 more, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health.On Sunday, Israeli forces opened fire on thousands of aid seekers near the same site in Rafah, killing at least 31 people and wounding more than 150, according to Gaza’s Civil Defence agency. One person was also shot dead at another aid distribution site, south of the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza, on the same day.Then, on Monday, three more people were killed and about 30 injured when Israeli forces again opened fire near the GHF’s Rafah distribution site.The Israeli military had denied reports its troops shot at civilians near or within the GHF aid distribution site on Sunday, saying its forces only fired warning shots at people who were not using “designated access routes”.Israeli army spokesperson Effie Defrin then claimed that soldiers only fired towards people who “were approaching in a way that endangered” the troops.The GHF, which began chaotic aid distribution operations on May 26, has also labelled reports of aid seekers being killed in large numbers “outright fabrications”, claiming it has yet to see evidence of an attack at or near its facilities.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has confirmed that it received a “mass casualty influx of 179 cases” after Sunday’s attack, including 21 patients who were “declared dead upon arrival”. Women and children were among the casualties, the group said, with the majority suffering “gunshot or shrapnel wounds”.The ICRC has also warned that Palestinians in Gaza are facing an “unprecedented scale and frequency of recent mass casualty incidents”.Reports of aid seekers being killed by Israeli forces over recent days have led to international outrage, with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres demanding an independent inquiry into the deaths and for “perpetrators to be held accountable”.The United Kingdom on Wednesday called for an “immediate and independent investigation” into the deadly incidents. UK Middle East Minister Hamish Falconer said the deaths were “deeply disturbing”, and called Israel’s new aid delivery measures “inhumane”.Israel continues to push ahead with its wider assault on Gaza, with at least 48 people killed in attacks across the Strip on Wednesday, according to Gaza’s Civil Defence. Among the casualties were at least 18 people killed in a strike on a tent sheltering displaced Palestinians in southern Khan Younis.The Israeli military on Thursday confirmed it had recovered the bodies of two Israeli captives who had been taken to Gaza during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.The military said in a statement the remains were retrieved from Khan Younis in southern Gaza.At least 1,139 people were killed and around 250 otheres were seized and taken to Gaza during the 2023 attack. Israel estimates that there are still 56 captives held by in Gaza, including at least 20 who are alive.Israel responded to the attack with its continuing war on Gaza, killing at least 54,418 Palestinians and wounding 124,190, according to statistics from the enclave’s Health Ministry.On Wednesday, the United States once again vetoed a draft UN Security Council resolution demanding unhindered humanitarian aid access across Gaza and an “immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire”.","Israeli strikes kill more than 50 Palestinians across Gaza","2025-07-15T20:38:48.538249Z"

The current mayor is running for re-election as an independent amid dwindling popularity.Here is a look at the elections in the Big Apple and what it could mean for the city and the country.New York City is solidly Democratic, so the party’s nominee is likely to cruise to victory in November.In 2021, then-Democratic candidate Eric Adams beat Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, by nearly 40 percentage points. Adams has since garnered a national profile.The next mayor will be the executive of the largest city in the United States – tackling numerous issues and pressing challenges, including housing, cost of living, congestion and public transport.The implications for New Yorkers are obvious, but the outcome of the race will also affect the nearly 65 million people who visit the city every year.New York is a major financial and cultural hub, not just for the US but for the entire world.Politically, the primary race could serve as a bellwether for the Democratic Party and the electoral viability of left-wing candidates ahead of the congressional midterm elections next year and the presidential vote two years later.The job comes with a national profile. The last three New York mayors ran for president.In the Democratic primaries, the two frontrunners are Cuomo, 67, and Mamdani, 33.The son of a former governor, Cuomo has an extensive resume. He served as the US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and New York attorney general before becoming the state’s governor in 2011.He resigned in 2021 after a sexual harassment scandal and is now staging what was once thought to be an unlikely political comeback, rebuilding alliances with politicians who called on him to step down a few years ago.He is running a campaign focused on improving the management of the city, addressing mental health issues and “combating anti-Semitism”.If Cuomo is the ultimate insider, Mamdani is his foil as a political insurgent.Born in Uganda to parents of Indian descent, Mamdani, who is endorsed by the Democratic Socialists for America (DSA), has been serving in the state assembly since 2021.He is running on a progressive platform that includes freezing rent, eliminating fees for public buses and establishing affordable, city-owned grocery stores.Mamdani’s rise in the polls has been fuelled by small donors and an “army” of left-wing volunteers.Also running on the Democratic side are city comptroller Brad Lander; New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams; former comptroller Scott Stringer; State Senator Jessica Ramos; State Senator Zellnor Myrie; Michael Blake, a political consultant and former state legislator; and Whitney Tilson, an investor.Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent after the scandals and investigations that have plagued his tenure.Conservative activist Curtis Sliwa is the sole Republican in the race.The first Democratic debate took place on June 4, and the second and final one is set for June 12. Early voting starts on June 14, and the primary election is on June 24.The general election will be on November 4.In local elections in New York City, one can vote for as many as five candidates at once with the ranked-choice system.Here’s how it works: Voters choose their candidates in order of favourability. In the first round of counting, the top choice votes are tallied. If no candidate gets more than 50 percent, more counting ensues with the bottom candidate removed.With each new round, the votes of the eliminated candidate are counted by the next choice on the ballot.Cuomo is leading the race, according to most surveys. An Emerson College poll last week showed the former governor with 35.1 percent support as a first choice – ahead of Mamdani with 22.7 and Lander with 10.5.Mamdani may appear like a distant second, but his rise in the race has been stunning. He was polling at 1 percent in February, according to an Emerson survey.The democratic socialist lawmaker does have a path to victory – consolidating the anti-Cuomo vote in the later rounds of counting.The next New York City mayor will not be deciding how much military aid Israel gets or how the US will vote on United Nations Security Council proposals calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.Yet, the conflict in the Middle East has been a factor in the local elections.Mamdani has been an outspoken supporter of Palestinian rights. He participated in a hunger strike outside the White House in November 2023 to demand an end to the war on Gaza.His positions have sparked outrage from Israel’s backers. Although Mamdani is a citizen, Republican New York City Council member Vickie Paladino called for his deportation on Monday.Paladino later doubled down in response to the outrage over her statement, claiming that Mamdani would not have been eligible for citizenship under the current regulations due to his involvement in pro-Palestine groups.For his part, Cuomo has positioned himself as Israel’s top defender, accusing several of his opponents – not just Mamdani – of being too critical of the US ally.“It’s very simple: anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism,” he said in April.Fix the City, a pro-Cuomo political group, has received large donations from pro-Israel donors, including $250,000 from billionaire Bill Ackman, according to New York’s Campaign Finance Board.New York City – home to Columbia University – has seen waves of protests against US support for Israel’s war in Gaza, which has killed more than 54,600 Palestinians.The issue may sway some voters, in part because it is viewed by many Democrats as a litmus test for broader ideological leaning.","New York City mayoral race: All you need to know","2025-06-28T10:06:20.078463Z"

What if they opened fire or something happened? I prayed for God’s protection.”As the crowd moved closer to the gates, heavy gunfire erupted from all directions.“I was terrified. I immediately looked towards my sons on the hill, and saw Yazan get shot and collapse,” he recalls.Yazid, also sitting by his brother’s bedside, describes the moments of terror.“We were standing on the hill as our father told us, and suddenly, the tanks opened fire.” He says. “My brother was hit in the stomach immediately.”“I saw his intestines spilling out – it was horrifying. Then people helped rush him to the hospital in a donkey cart.”Down by the gates, Ihab was struggling to reach his sons, trying to fight against the crowd while avoiding the shots still ringing out.“Shooting was coming from every direction – from tanks, quadcopters.“I saw people helping my son, eventually dragging him away.”When Ihab managed to get away from the crowd, he ran as best as his malnourished body could manage, towards Nasser Hospital, in hopes that Yazan had been taken there. It felt like more than an hour, he says.At Nasser Hospital, he learned that Yazan had been taken into surgery.“I finally breathed. I thanked God he was still alive. I had completely lost hope,” he says.The bullet that hit Yazan had torn through his intestines and spleen, and the doctors say he needs long and intensive treatment.Sitting by him is his mother, Iman, who asks despairingly why anyone would shoot at people trying to get food. She and Ihab have five children, the youngest is a seven-month-old girl.“I went to get food for my children. Hunger is killing us,” says Ihab.“These aid distributions are known to be degrading and humiliating – but we’re desperate. I’m desperate because my children are starving, and even then, we are shot at?”He had tried to get aid once before, he says, but both times he came away empty-handed.“The first time, there was a deadly stampede. We barely escaped. This time, my son was wounded and again… nothing,” he says.But he knows he cannot stop trying.“I’ll risk it for my family. Either I come back alive or I die. I’m desperate. Hunger is killing us.”The GHF, marketed as a neutral humanitarian mechanism, was launched in early 2025 and uses private US military contractors to “secure the distribution points”.The GHF’s head, Jake Wood, resigned his post two days before distribution began, citing concerns that the foundation would not be impartial or act in accordance with humanitarian principles.Five days later, on May 30, the Boston Consulting Group, which had been part of the planning and implementation of the foundation, withdrew its team and terminated its association with GHF.International aid organisations have been unanimous in criticising the GHF and its methods.Lying nearby in the tent ward is Mohammed al-Homs, 40, a father of five.He had also headed out early on Sunday to try to get some food for his family, but moments after arriving at the al-Alam Roundabout roundabout, “I was shot twice – once in the leg and once in the mouth, shattering my front teeth,” he says.“I collapsed, there were so many injured and dead around me. Everyone was screaming and running. Gunfire was coming from tanks, drones everywhere. It felt like the end of the world.”He lay bleeding on the ground for what felt like an hour, as medical teams were not able to reach the injured.Then, word spread that the gates had opened for distribution, and those who could move started heading towards the centre.It was only then that people could start moving the wounded to a nearby medical point.“This was my first time trying to get aid, and it will be my last,” Mohammed says.“I didn’t expect to survive. We went looking for food for our hungry children and were met with drones and tanks.”Also in the tent is someone who had succeeded in getting an aid package on the first day of distribution, on May 27, and decided to try again on Sunday: 36-year-old Khaled al-Lahham.Al-Lahham is taking care of 10 family members: his parents, one aunt, and seven siblings, all of whom are displaced in the tents of al-Mawasi.He had managed to catch a ride with five friends that morning, driving as close as they could to the al-Alam Roundabout roundabout.As the distribution time approached, the six friends started getting out of the car.“Suddenly, there was loud gunfire all around and people screaming. I felt a sharp pain in my leg – a bullet had passed clean through my thigh,” says Khaled, who did not make it fully out of the car.“I was screaming and bleeding while people around me ran and screamed. The shooting was frenzied,” he adds. “There were tanks, quadcopters – fire came from every direction.”Injured, Khaled could not get out of the car and huddled there until one of his friends managed to return and drive him to the hospital.“I never imagined I’d face death for a box of food,” Khaled says.“If they don’t want to distribute the aid, why do they lie to people and kill them like this?“This is all deliberate.

Preliminary reports indicate that at least four people were killed amid the stampede and gunfire, though the cause of the latter was not immediately clear.The agency said that increasing aid was “the only way to reassure people that they will not starve”.Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud reported from Gaza City that the search for food has proven deadly, even away from crowded distribution areas.“For example, in the past couple of hours, two people were reported killed in the Shujayea neighbourhood [of Gaza City]. They were killed trying to get to their homes,” he said.“They were forced to evacuate in the past few weeks. They left everything behind. All of their belongings, all of their food supplies that they managed to get … [were] inside the house.”As the attacks have continued, a breakthrough for a more lasting agreement to end the fighting has remained elusive.Still, US President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, on Wednesday said he had “very good feelings” about soon reaching a long-term solution.That came shortly after Hamas said it had reached an agreement with Witkoff on a general framework for a permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the unhindered entry of humanitarian aid.The framework appears at odds with the position of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has said the Israeli military would remain in Gaza indefinitely, continuing to control aid access and pursuing the complete defeat of Hamas.Speaking to Israel’s parliament on Wednesday, Netanyahu listed top Hamas officials killed throughout the war. The list included Mohammed Sinwar, the brother and successor of killed Hamas military leader Yahya Sinwar.Hamas has not yet confirmed Mohammed Sinwar’s death.","‘Heinous crime’: Israel kills 10 desperate aid seekers in Gaza in 48 hours","2025-06-28T09:53:53.180703Z"

It was chaotic, undignified and unsafe,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini told reporters at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo.“I believe it is a waste of resources and a distraction from atrocities,” Lazzarini continued. “We already have an aid distribution system that is fit for purpose.”“The clock is ticking towards famine, so [the] humanitarian [system] must be allowed to do its life-saving work now,” Lazzarini said.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later acknowledged a “loss of control momentarily” at the distribution centre, but a senior military official said the distribution was nonetheless “a success”.Israel has facilitated the GHF’s efforts and said the model keeps supplies out of Hamas’s hands.The GHF has faced accusations of helping Israel fulfil its military objectives, while excluding Palestinians, bypassing the UN system and failing to adhere to humanitarian principles.The GHF said it had distributed about 8,000 food boxes, equivalent to 462,000 meals, since Israel eased an 11-week blockade of the war-shattered Palestinian enclave last week.The UN and other international aid groups have boycotted the foundation, which they said undermines the principle that humanitarian aid should be distributed independently of the parties to a conflict and based on need.“The model of aid distribution proposed by Israel does not align with core humanitarian principles,” Lazzarini said on Wednesday.“It will deprive a large part of Gaza, the highly vulnerable people, of desperately needed assistance,” he said.He added, “We used to have, before, 400 distribution places, centres in Gaza. With this new system, we are talking about three to four, maximum, distribution places.“So it’s also a way to incite people to be forcibly displaced to get humanitarian assistance,” he said.As a trickle of aid has resumed, Israeli forces – now in control of wide areas of Gaza – have kept up their offensive, killing 3,901 Palestinians since a short ceasefire collapsed in mid-March, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.At least eight people were killed and others were wounded early on Wednesday when Israeli forces targeted the home of journalist Osama al-Arbid, who reportedly survived the strike in the as-Saftawi area in northern Gaza.Medical sources told Al Jazeera that at least 15 people have been killed by Israeli attacks across Gaza since early on Wednesday.The Health Ministry in Gaza said on Monday that at least 3,822 people had been killed in the territory since Israel ended a ceasefire on March 18, taking the war’s overall death toll to 53,977, mostly civilians.","US-backed Gaza aid model ‘distraction from atrocities’, UNRWA chief says","2025-06-24T20:19:05.990649Z"

Historically, a false flag operation referred to a military force or a ship flying another country’s flag for deception purposes.Some confirmed false flag operations have occurred throughout history. But they have been outpaced in recent years by conspiracy theories that label real events as “false flags,” or an attack that’s designed to look like it was perpetrated by one person or party, when in fact it was committed by someone else.Unfounded false flag claims often follow mass violence incidents, including Israel’s war on Gaza, the 2022 Uvalde school shooting and the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.Historians warn that social media rumours alleging that big news events are “false flags” should be viewed sceptically. Real false flag operations are logistically complex and tend to involve many people.PolitiFact found no credible evidence to support the claim that the Israeli embassy employees’ shooting is a false flag.The X post said the shooting, which happened on a Wednesday, is a “false flag” because the museum had closed four hours earlier. The museum usually closes at 5pm on Wednesdays, except for the first Wednesday of each month, when it closes at 8pm.However, the American Jewish Committee hosted an event on May 21 at the museum, scheduled to end at 9pm.Preliminary investigations say the shooting happened after 9pm local time when the two victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were exiting an event at the Capital Jewish Museum, said Pamela A Smith, the Metropolitan Police Department police chief, at a May 21 press conference.Police identified the suspect as Elias Rodriguez, a 31-year-old man from Chicago, Illinois. Rodriguez chanted, “Free, free, Palestine” after he was arrested, Smith said. The Justice Department charged him with the murder of foreign officials and other crimes.The shooting, which has widely been criticised, came as Israel’s actions in Gaza has caused a global outrage and protests calling for ceasefire.Jeanine Pirro, interim US attorney for the District of Columbia, said on May 22 that the incident is being investigated as a hate crime and “terrorism”.The Capital Jewish Museum is diagonally across the street from the FBI’s DC field office.

Defending what the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) termed “by far the longest and most destructive operation in the occupied West Bank since the second intifada in the 2000s”, the Israeli military claimed its intention was to preserve its “freedom of action” within the Palestinian territory as it continued to rip up roads and destroy buildings, infrastructure, and water and electricity lines.The report by the British research group Forensic Architecture suggested Israel has imposed what researchers call a system of “spatial control”, essentially a series of mechanisms that allow it to deploy military units across Palestinian territory at will.The report focused on Israeli action in the refugee camps of Jenin and Far’a in the northern West Bank and Nur Shams and Tulkarem in the northwestern West Bank. Researchers interviewed and analysed witness statements, satellite imagery and hundreds of videos to demonstrate a systematic plan of coordinated Israeli action intended to impose a network of military control in refugee camps across the West Bank similar to that imposed upon Gaza.In the process, existing roads have been widened while homes, private gardens and adjacent properties have been demolished to allow for the rapid deployment of Israeli military vehicles.“This network of military routes is clearly visible in the Jenin refugee camp and evidence indicates that the same tactic is, at the time of publication, being repeated in the Nur Shams and Tulkarm refugee camps,” the report’s authors noted.Israeli ministers have previously stated that they planned to use the same methods in the West Bank that have destroyed the Gaza Strip, leading to more than 54,000 Palestinians killed and the majority of buildings damaged or destroyed.In January, Defence Minister Israel Katz said Israel would apply the “lesson” of “repeated raids in Gaza” to the Jenin refugee camp. The following month, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who has control over much of the administration of the West Bank, boasted that “Tulkarem and Jenin will look like Jabalia and Shujayea. Nablus and Ramallah will resemble Rafah and Khan Younis,” comparing refugee camps in the West Bank to areas in Gaza that have been devastated by Israeli bombing and ground offensives.“They will also be turned into uninhabitable ruins, and their residents will be forced to migrate and seek a new life in other countries,” Smotrich said.Hamze Attar, a Luxembourg-based defence analyst, told Al Jazeera these tactics are not new in Palestinian territory, having first been deployed by the British during their mandate over historic Palestine, which preceded Israel’s foundation in 1948.“It’s part of the “counterinsurgency” strategy,” he said. “Bigger roads [mean] easy access to forces – bigger roads, less congested battle management; bigger roads, less ability for fighters to escape from house to house.”About 75,000 Palestinians live in the Jenin, Nur Shams, Far’a and Tulkarem refugee camps. They were either displaced themselves or descended from those displaced during the Nakba (which means “catastrophe”) when roughly 750,000 Palestinians were forced from their homes by Zionist forces from 1947 to 1949 as part of the creation of Israel.Now, at least 40,000 of those living in the West Bank refugee camps have been displaced as a result of Operation Iron Wall, according to the United Nations.As in Gaza, many of these people were forced from their homes on orders from the Israeli military, which researchers said have been “weaponised” against the local population.Once an area had been cleared of its buildings and roads, it becomes a kill zone and the Israeli military is free to reshape and build whatever it likes without interference from residents, the report said.“Such engineered mass displacement has allowed the Israeli military to reshape these built environments unobstructed,” the report noted, adding that when Palestinian residents did try to return to their homes after Israeli military action, they were often obstructed by the continued presence of troops.Forensic Architecture researchers said Israeli attacks on medical facilities in Gaza have also spilled over into the West Bank.“Israeli attacks on medical infrastructure in the West Bank have included placing hospitals under siege, obstructing ambulance access to areas with injured civilians, targeting medical personnel, and using at least one medical facility as a detention and interrogation centre,” the report said.During Israel’s initial attacks on the Jenin refugee camp on January 21, multiple hospitals were surrounded by the Israeli military, including Jenin Government Hospital, al-Amal Hospital and al-Razi Hospital, researchers noted.The following day, civilians and hospital staff reported that the main road leading to Jenin Government Hospital was destroyed by Israeli military bulldozers and access to the hospital was blocked by newly constructed berms, or land barriers,On February 4, reports from Jenin said the Israeli military was obstructing ambulances carrying injured people from reaching the hospital.Also carrying unmistakable echoes of Gaza was an UNRWA report in early February saying the Israeli military had forcibly co-opted one of the health centres at the UNRWA-run Arroub camp near Jerusalem as an interrogation and detention site.The attacks on healthcare facilities were part of a wider campaign to damage civilian infrastructure in the West Bank, the Forensic Architecture report said, using armoured bulldozers, controlled demolitions and air attacks.Researchers said they verified more than 200 examples of Israeli soldiers deliberately destroying buildings and street networks in all four of the refugee camps with armoured bulldozers reducing civilian roads to barely passable piles of exposed earth and rubble.Civilian property, including parked vehicles, food carts and agricultural buildings, such as greenhouses, were also destroyed during Israeli military operations, they said.","Mapping Israel’s military campaign in the occupied West Bank","2025-07-15T20:34:48.770711Z"

Al-Najjar’s remaining child, 11-year-old Adam, is in critical condition in an intensive care unit.The attacks come amid an Israeli blockade for almost three months that has choked off access to essential food, fuel, and medical supplies. Aid agencies warn that thousands of children are now at risk of death from starvation.Children account for 31 percent of Palestinians confirmed killed during Israel’s 19 months of war on Gaza, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. This figure excludes deaths that have been reported but for which the victims remain unidentified, suggesting the real toll is higher.A report commissioned by the United Nations also highlighted Israel’s disproportionate violence against children through targeting densely populated areas, with repeated air raids on residential buildings contributing to the rising child death toll.At least 22 Palestinians were killed in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip since dawn on Sunday, according to Al Jazeera Arabic.Below are some of the children killed in Israeli attacks:Known for her smile and volunteer work in Gaza, Yaqeen Hammad was killed after Israel shelled al-Baraka in Deir el-Balah, northern Gaza, on Friday night.The 11-year-old influencer and her older brother, Mohamed Hammad, delivered food, toys and clothing to displaced families, the Palestine Chronicle reports. She also played an active role in the Ouena collective – a Gaza-based nonprofit group dedicated to aid and humanitarian relief.Messages of grief and tributes from activists, Yaqeen’s followers and journalists poured in after news of her death spread online.“Her body may be gone, but her impact remains a beacon of humanity,” wrote Mahmoud Bassam, a photojournalist in Gaza.“Instead of being at school and enjoying her childhood, she was active on Instagram and participating in campaigns to help others in Gaza. No words. Absolutely no words,” another tribute read on X.Activists and Palestinian platforms shared on social media painful scenes of Mohammed Yassine on a hospital bed.Appearing in a video, holding Yassine’s body, Mahmoud Basal of Gaza’s Civil Defence said: “Mohammed Yassine died from hunger, a direct result of the occupation’s prevention of food and medical aid from entering Gaza.”“Mohammed was not the first child, and the fear has become a certainty that he won’t be the last,” Basal added.An Israeli attack on the home of al-Najjar on Friday killed nine of her children and critically injured 11-year-old Adam.Sidar, Luqman, Sadin, Reval, Ruslan, Jubran, Eve, Rakan and Yahya  – aged between seven months and 12 years – all died in the attack, Gaza’s Government Media Office said.Al-Najjar is a paediatrician at the southern city’s Nasser Hospital, where her husband is receiving care after being critically injured in the attack.“It is unbelievable,” said Ahmad al-Farra, head of the hospital’s paediatrics department, of the attack’s impact.“You can’t imagine the shock that [al-Najjar] had when she heard about that [attack].

This is the first time Trump’s plan has been mentioned by Netanyahu as one of the conditions to halt fighting. Multiple nations and rights groups have called the plan ethnic cleansing.Netanyahu said Israel should avoid a “humanitarian crisis to preserve our freedom of operational action”, referring to Israel’s decision to allow a very limited number of humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza. He also referenced a much-criticised plan “developed with the US” to distribute food in the enclave without Hamas taking control of it. The Palestinian group denies it takes aid. Israel has come under international pressure to halt its punishing total blockade on Gaza, which had prevented any food or aid trucks from entering the territory since March 2.That has exacerbated the already dire humanitarian catastrophe inside the enclave. A United Nations-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification assessment found more than 93 percent of children in Gaza, or about 930,000, are on the brink of famine.On Wednesday, the Israeli army said it allowed 100 aid trucks carrying flour, baby food and medical equipment into Gaza. Yet UN officials said distribution problems had meant no aid had so far reached people in need.“The limited supplies finally being allowed to enter Kerem Shalom [in Arabic, the Karem Abu Salem border crossing] are nowhere near enough to meet the needs in Gaza, which are vast, which are tremendous. Much, much more aid needs to get in,” said Stephane Dujarric, the UN chief’s spokesperson.Aid groups have said the amount of aid that Israel is allowing is not nearly enough, calling Netanyahu’s efforts a “smokescreen to pretend the siege is over”.“The Israeli authorities’ decision to allow a ridiculously inadequate amount of aid into Gaza after months of an air-tight siege signals their intention to avoid the accusation of starving people in Gaza while, in fact, keeping them barely surviving,” said Pascale Coissard, the emergency coordinator in Khan Younis for Doctors Without Borders.Critics were swift in reacting to Netanyahu’s news conference. His “words today mean the occupation of Gaza for many years and waking up every day to the death of soldiers”, opposition leader Yair Lapid said, adding that the country’s international standing would collapse and the economy would be severely damaged.“I saw a presentation by a pressured, obsessed, lying man who takes no responsibility for anything,” the Democrats party leader Yair Golan said after the news conference. “I will sue you for defamation because of the lies you spread about me, and we will defeat you in the elections very soon and send you to the pages of history.”Netanyahu had slammed Golan on Tuesday after the opposition leader had said, “A sane country … does not kill babies as a hobby.” Netanyahu called the comment “appalling”.","Netanyahu says Israel will control ‘all of Gaza’ after latest offensive","2025-07-15T20:31:49.129958Z"

But Bar said Netanyahu’s decision was motivated by a series of events between November 2024 and February 2025.In the unclassified part of the court submission, Bar said Netanyahu had told him “on more than one occasion” that he expected Shin Bet to take action against Israelis involved in anti-government demonstrations, “with a particular focus on monitoring the protests’ financial backers”.The Shin Bet head also said he had refused to sign off on a security request aimed at relieving Netanyahu from testifying at an ongoing corruption trial in which he faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of public trust.The court said the decision to dismiss Bar was made without “a factual basis” and without giving him a formal hearing before firing him, according to a report by the Times of Israel.Wednesday’s ruling noted “irregularities” in the process that led to Bar’s sacking, as well as “a disregard for fundamental principles regarding internal security.”The Israeli cabinet voted to dismiss Bar in March, triggering mass protests and accusations of autocratic pursuits by the far-right government.The High Court of Justice halted the decision until a hearing could be held. Several groups, including opposition politicians, had filed petitions with the court against the government’s decision.In April, the government revoked the decision to fire Bar a day after he said he would step down.Following Bar’s decision to quit the job, Wednesday’s Supreme Court ruling said that “this announcement puts an end to the [legal] procedure.”","Israeli top court rules Shin Bet chief Ban’s firing by Netanyahu ‘unlawful’","2025-07-14T21:42:58.681958Z"

The past week has seen an intensification of violence across the besieged Palestinian territory, which has killed hundreds of people.The reason for the disappearance of the NGO provision remains unclear, and experts warned it may yet reappear in the bill before the final vote in the House, expected later in the week.The office of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.With a razor-thin majority in the House, Republicans need every vote to pass the tax bill, which Trump has put at the top of his agenda in Congress.Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the section may have been removed to avoid additional controversy for the must-pass bill, especially because the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan office that oversees procedures, may have rejected it for violating the rules.“It’s possible that this is a hiccup that they didn’t want, given that it wasn’t even likely to go through,” Hamadanchy told Al Jazeera.“I can’t tell you that is the reason for sure. What I can tell you is that we continue to be very vigilant in case it comes back, either later this week or in the future.”For weeks, Trump has been calling on Congress to pass the bill, which extends his 2017 tax cuts, a key component of his economic plans.But the proposal has faced some opposition from conservative budget hawks, who have argued it does not cut spending enough and would add to the nation’s $36.2 trillion debt. So Republicans can ill-afford unnecessary issues that could derail the passage of the legislation.Rights groups have been rallying against the “nonprofit killer”, saying it violates free speech and the right to due process.The proposal would have granted the secretary of state power to unilaterally declare an NGO “terrorist supporting” and make it ineligible for tax exemptions.It also said the government would not have to reveal the reason behind the designation if “disclosure of such description would be inconsistent with national security or law enforcement interests”.Under the current rules, organisations certified to be nonprofits by the government get breaks on their federal income taxes. The status also makes donations to such groups tax deductible for donors.While the withdrawn measure would have allowed a targeted NGO to challenge the secretary of state’s decision in court, losing the tax exempt status, even if temporarily, could have proven costly for nonprofits, especially smaller organisations.Hamadanchy said being accused of supporting terrorism could also have prompted banks to close down the accounts of the groups.“And then you have legal costs fighting off the designation because even if you might win in court, it’s going to take time to get there, and it’s going to cause a lot of damage to your organisation through that process,” he said.“And that’s sort of the point because they want to chill speech.”Hamadanchy noted that existing laws already make material support for a designated “terrorist” group a criminal offence with severe penalties.The legislative push coincided with the Trump administration’s crackdown on Palestinian rights supporters, especially on college campuses.Secretary of State Marco Rubio has revoked the student visas of several Palestine advocates – who have not been charged with a criminal offence – over allegations of “support for terrorism”.Some advocacy groups have portrayed the “nonprofit killer” as part of a broader push to muzzle voices critical of Israel.“This bill is designed to silence dissent, especially from Muslim, Palestinian and civil rights organizations that speak out against injustice and genocide,” the Council on American Islamic Relations said in a statement last week.“It threatens every nonprofit that engages in advocacy, educates the public, or challenges government policy.”The apparent setback for the nonprofit provision came nearly two weeks after House leaders cancelled a vote on a bill to restrict boycotts of Israel after a backlash from right-wing legislators who voiced opposition to the measure on free speech grounds.Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, said it would be “interesting” to see how Republican leaders would deal with staunchly pro-Israel measures like the “nonprofit killer” going forward.“They on the one hand likely see this as a fun opportunity to embarrass Democrats – whose opposition will be framed as anti-Israel or enabling terror and antisemitism – and on the other hand they have to worry about principled opposition from within their own ranks,” Friedman told Al Jazeera in a statement.","Measure targeting pro-Palestine NGOs disappears from US tax bill","2025-06-28T10:04:14.315668Z"

Human rights groups and United Nations-backed experts have accused Israel of systematically destroying Gaza’s healthcare system.Earlier, Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of al-Shifa Hospital in the besieged enclave’s north, told Al Jazeera on Sunday that the latest strikes – which have been ongoing since Saturday – indicate that Israeli attacks on Gaza’s hospitals are intensifying.“The medical teams are really suffering, and we have a few numbers of medical teams and staff … and a lot of people are in need [of] more medical care,” Abu Salmiya said by phone from the hospital on Sunday.Thousands of sick and wounded people could die, he warned. Blood donations are urgently needed.This has been underscored by Gaza’s Health Ministry, which confirmed that Israeli forces besieged the facility in Beit Lahiya, adding that “a state of panic and confusion is prevailing”.The ministry later said that Israel had cut off the arrival of patients and staff, “effectively forcing the hospital out of service”.With “the shutdown of the Indonesian Hospital, all public hospitals in the North Gaza Governorate are now out of service”, it said.Gaza’s healthcare facilities have been targeted repeatedly throughout Israel’s deadly assault that began 18 months ago.Other facilities in the north that have been bombed, burned, and besieged by the Israeli military since the start of the war include Kamal Adwan Hospital, al-Shifa Hospital, al-Ahli Hospital, and al-Awda Hospital. Dozens of other medical clinics, stations, and vehicles have also come under attack.The targeting of health facilities, medical personnel and patients is considered a war crime under the 1949 Geneva Convention.Israel has also battered several hospitals in Gaza’s central and southern areas, including Deir el-Balah’s Al-Aqsa Hospital and the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.Earlier this week, Israel struck two hospitals in Khan Younis. Nine missiles slammed into and around the courtyard of the European Gaza Hospital, killing at least 16 people, while an attack on the Nasser Medical Complex killed two people, including a wounded journalist.Incessant attacks on Gaza’s healthcare sector have left it reeling, devastating its ability to function, while doctors say they are out of medicine to treat routine conditions.Hospitals have also been on the verge of total collapse amid a brutal and ongoing blockade, where Israel continues to bar the entry of much-needed medical supplies, fuel, and other humanitarian aid including food and clean water.The crisis in Gaza has reached one of its darkest periods, humanitarian officials warn, as famine also looms.Israeli air strikes have killed hundreds of Palestinians in the last 72 hours.Strikes over the weekend have also put the European Hospital, the only remaining facility providing cancer treatments in Gaza, out of service.Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said dozens of Palestinians have been wounded, and doctors say “they’re facing numerous challenges in treating injuries because of a lack of medical supplies”.“Israeli air strikes in Gaza are still escalating as drones and fighter jets hover in the sky,” Khoudary said.The death toll has reached the same level of intensity as the earliest days of the war, said Emily Tripp, executive director of Airwars, an independent group in London that tracks recent conflicts.She says preliminary data indicate the number of incidents where at least one person was killed or injured by Israeli fire hovered around 700 in April. It’s a figure comparable only to October or December 2023 – one of the heaviest periods of bombardment.In the last 10 days of March, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimates, an average of 100 children were killed or maimed by Israeli air strikes every day.Almost 3,000 of the estimated 53,000 killed by Israel since October 7, 2023, have lost their lives since Israel broke a fragile ceasefire on March 18, Gaza’s Health Ministry said.Among those killed in recent days include a volunteer pharmacist with the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, who was killed with her family in a strike on Gaza City on May 4.A midwife from Al Awda Health and Community Association was also killed with her family in another strike on May 7.A journalist working for Qatar-based television network Al Araby TV, along with 11 members of his family, was also killed.","Israeli strikes batter Gaza hospitals as brutal siege, bombing intensify","2025-07-15T20:40:56.125733Z"

Many more could starve to death in the coming days and weeks unless immediate action is taken,” it said.Meanwhile, the Council of Europe, a body that works to safeguard human rights and democracy, also noted that Gaza was suffering from a “deliberate starvation” and warned that Israel was sowing “the seeds for the next Hamas” in the territory, referring to the Palestinian armed group.“The time for a moral reckoning over the treatment of Palestinians has come – and it is long overdue,” said Dora Bakoyannis, rapporteur for the Middle East at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.The European calls came hours after UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said 160,000 pallets of relief and 9,000 trucks were ready to enter Gaza.“To those proposing an alternative modality for aid distribution, let’s not waste time. We already have a plan,” he said in a statement.“We have the people. We have the distribution networks. We have the trust of the communities on the ground. And we have the aid itself – 160,000 pallets of it – ready to move. Now,” he said.“We demand rapid, safe, and unimpeded aid delivery for civilians in need. Let us work.”Israel has halted the entry of food, medication and all other essentials into Gaza since March 2. UN agencies and other humanitarian groups have warned of shrinking food, fuel and medicine supplies to the territory of 2.4 million Palestinians facing acute starvation.Earlier, the US and Israel said they were preparing a plan that would allow the resumption of aid by an NGO, while keeping supplies out of Hamas’s hands.Under the heavily criticised alternative aid plan, the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aims to start work in Gaza by the end of May.It intends to work with private US security and logistics firms to transport aid into Gaza to so-called secure hubs where it will then be distributed by aid groups, a source familiar with the plan told the Reuters news agency. It is unclear how the foundation will be funded.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has also asked Israel to allow humanitarian deliveries by the UN and aid groups to resume now until its infrastructure is fully operational, saying this is essential to “alleviate the ongoing humanitarian pressure”.The UN, however, said it would not work with the foundation because the distribution plan is not impartial, neutral or independent. Israel says the blockade, alongside “military pressure”, is intended to force Hamas to free the remaining captives.On Thursday, senior Hamas official Basem Naim reiterated the group’s position that the entry of aid into Gaza is a prerequisite for any truce talks with Israel.“Access to food, water and medicine is a fundamental human right – not a subject for negotiation,” he said.","Seven European nations urge Israel to ‘reverse its current policy’ on Gaza","2025-06-24T20:41:13.372912Z"

In recent days, Israel has intensified its offensive, as tens of thousands of Palestinians are forced to starve.At a preparatory meeting of the Arab League summit, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said they will try to endorse decisions that were made at their meeting in Cairo in March to support Gaza’s reconstruction as an alternative to Trump’s widely condemned proposal to take over the enclave.During his visit to Qatar, Trump on Thursday reiterated that he wanted the US to “take” Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone”. Earlier this year, he caused an uproar by declaring that the US would turn Gaza into a “Riviera of the Middle East”, prompting Arab leaders to come up with a plan to rebuild the territory, at a summit in Cairo.The Arab plan for Gaza proposes rebuilding the Palestinian enclave without displacing its 2.4 million residents.Besides Gaza, Arab officials also discussed Syria, which only six months ago entered a new chapter in its history after the fall of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad.Earlier this week, Trump in Riyadh met Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose group spearheaded the offensive that toppled al-Assad last December. Prior to their meeting, he also announced that US sanctions on Syria will be lifted in a huge boost to the government in Damascus.Al-Sharaa, who was imprisoned for years in Iraq on charges of belonging to al-Qaeda following the 2003 US-led invasion, however, missed Baghdad’s summit after several powerful Iraqi politicians voiced opposition to his visit. The Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani represented Damascus instead.Saturday’s summit also came amid Iran’s ongoing nuclear talks with the US. Trump has pursued diplomacy with Iran as he seeks to stave off a threatened military strike by Israel on Iran, a desire shared by many of the region’s leaders.On Thursday, Trump said a deal was “getting close”, but by Friday, he was warning that “something bad is going to happen” if the Iranians do not move fast.Iraq has only recently regained a semblance of normalcy after decades of devastating conflict and turmoil, and its leaders view the summit as an opportunity to project an image of stability.Reporting from Baghdad, Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud Abdelwahed said the summit was “very crucial” for Iraq.“This is the first time the summit has been held in Iraq since 2012 and Iraq takes it as a credit to regain its rule as a player to bridge the gap between member states of the Arab League,” he said.","Arab League calls for funds to rebuild Gaza at summit in Baghdad","2025-07-14T21:33:28.039299Z"

The word “historic” was used more than a few times by US officials to describe the visits.With Trump returning to the White House, here are five key takeaways from his trip:Addressing an investment summit in Riyadh, Trump promoted a realist approach to the Middle East — one in which the US does not intervene in the affairs of other countries.He took a swipe at neoconservatives who oversaw the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as he lauded Gulf leaders for developing the region.“This great transformation has not come from Western intervention or flying people in beautiful planes, giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs,” he said.“The gleaming marbles of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called nation-builders, neo-cons or liberal nonprofits like those who spent trillions and trillions of dollars failing to develop Kabul, Baghdad, so many other cities.”Trump built his political brand with his “America First” slogan, calling for the US to focus on its own issues instead of helping — or bombing — foreign countries.But his words at the investment summit marked a stern rebuke of the neo-cons who dominated Trump’s Republican Party a decade ago.“In the end, the so-called nation-builders wrecked far more nations than they built, and the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves,” Trump said.It is rare for US presidents to travel to the Middle East and not visit Israel, but Trump omitted the US ally from his itinerary as he toured the region.Skipping Israel was seen as a reflection of the deteriorating ties between the US administration and the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.This week’s trip also came in the context of several moves perceived as evidence of the US marginalising Israel. The US has continued to hold talks with Israel’s rival Iran, announced a ceasefire with the Houthis in Yemen, and conducted unilateral negotiations to release Israeli soldier Edan Alexander, a US citizen, from Hamas captivity.Moreover, while touring the Gulf, Trump did not use his remarks to prioritise the establishment of formal diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which had been a top goal during his first term.It remains unclear how Trump’s decisions will affect the “special relationship” between the two allies, but experts say it is becoming increasingly apparent that the US no longer views the Middle East solely through the lens of Israel.“Is it a tactical problem for Netanyahu and the entire pro-Israel lobby? I think it is,” Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University, said of Trump’s shift.“It does throw a wrench in the machinery because it is a president who is showing openly daylight with Israeli decision-making, and not just in rhetoric, but acting on it — leaving Israel out of the process.”With that chasm emerging, some Palestinian rights advocates had hoped that the US president’s trip to the region would see Washington pursue a deal to end Israel’s war on Gaza.But as Trump marvelled at the luxurious buildings in the Gulf, Israel intensified its bombardment to destroy what’s left of the Palestinian territory.No ceasefire was announced, despite reports of continuing talks in Doha. And Israel appears to be pushing forward with its plan to expand its assault on Gaza as it continues to block aid for the nearly two million people in the enclave, leading to fears of famine.United Nations experts and rights groups have described the situation as a genocide.But despite preaching “peace and prosperity” for both Israelis and Palestinians, Trump made no strong push to end the war during this week’s trip.On Thursday, Trump suggested that he has not given up on the idea of depopulating Gaza and turning it over to the US — a proposal that legal experts say amounts to ethnic cleansing.“I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good. Make it a freedom zone,” he said. “Let the United States get involved, and make it just a freedom zone.”In a move that surprised many observers, Trump announced from Riyadh that he will offer sanction relief to Syria, as the country emerges from a decade-plus civil war.Trump also met with interim Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa and described him as a “young, attractive guy”.A wholesale lifting of sanctions was not expected, in part because of Israel’s hostility to the new authorities in Syria. Israeli officials often describe al-Sharaa, who led al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria before severing ties with the group, as a “terrorist”.But Trump said he made the decision to lift the economic penalties against Syria at the request of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.“I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,” the US president said.The White House said on Wednesday that Trump had a list of requests for al-Sharaa, including establishing diplomatic relations with Israel and deporting “Palestinian terrorists”.Removing US sanctions, which had been imposed on the government of former President Bashar al-Assad, is likely to be a boost for the new Syrian authorities, who are grappling with an ailing economy after years of conflict.“Lifting sanctions on Syria represents a fundamental turning point,” Ibrahim Nafi Qushji, an economist, told Al Jazeera.“The Syrian economy will transition from interacting with developing economies to integrating with more developed ones, potentially significantly reshaping trade and investment relations.”In Saudi Arabia, Trump declared that he wants a deal with Iran — and he wants it done quickly.“We really want them to be a successful country,” the US president said of Iran.“We want them to be a wonderful, safe, great country, but they cannot have a nuclear weapon. This is an offer that will not last forever. The time is right now for them to choose.”Trump warned Iran that, if it rejects his “olive branch”, he would impose a “massive maximum pressure” against Tehran and choke off its oil exports.Notably, Trump did not threaten explicit military action against Iran, a departure from his previous rhetoric. In late March, for instance, he told NBC News, “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing.”Iran says it is not seeking nuclear weapons and would welcome a stringent monitoring programme of its nuclear facilities.But Israel and some hawks want the Iranian nuclear programme completely dismantled, not just scaled back.US and Iranian officials have held multiple rounds of talks this year, but Tehran says it has not received an official offer from Washington. And Trump officials have not explicitly indicated what the endgame of the talks is.US envoy Steve Witkoff said last month that Iran “must stop and eliminate” uranium enrichment, but days earlier, he had suggested that enrichment should be brought down to civilian energy levels.Several Gulf countries, including the three that Trump visited this week, have welcomed the nuclear negotiations, as relations between Iran and its Arab neighbours have grown more stable in recent years.Before entering politics, Trump was a real estate mogul who played up his celebrity persona as a mega-rich dealmaker. He appears to have brought that business mindset to the White House.While in the wealthy Gulf region, Trump was in his element. He announced deals that would see Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE buy US arms and invest in American firms. According to the White House, Trump secured a total of $2 trillion in investments from the Middle East during the trip.And his administration is framing the deals as a major political and economic victory for Trump.“While it took President Biden nearly four years to secure $1 trillion in investments, President Trump achieved this in his first month, with additional investment commitments continuing to roll in,” the White House said.“President Trump is accelerating investment in America and securing fair trade deals around the world, paving the way for a new Golden Age of lasting prosperity for generations to come.”","Five key takeaways from US President Donald Trump’s Middle East trip","2025-06-24T20:14:25.565653Z"

The Israeli military has not commented on the strikes.Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated a promise to push ahead with a promised escalation in pursuit of his aim to destroy Hamas, the Palestinian armed group that governs Gaza.That follows an announcement by Netanyahu last week that the military campaign would be intensified should Hamas fail to agree a deal to release the remaining captives by the time United States President Donald Trump finished his tour of the Middle East.Trump was due to wrap up his four-day trip, which did not include a visit to Israel or Palestine, on Friday.There had been hope that the tour could help usher in a ceasefire deal or renewal of aid to Gaza. The humanitarian crisis in the enclave is building with an Israeli blockade of the territory now in its third month.However, Israeli officials suggested last week that plans include the “conquest” and full military occupation of the entire Gaza Strip, and potentially a bid to push Palestinians out of the enclave – a suggestion also put forward by Trump.Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 53,010 Palestinians and wounded 119,919, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. The Strip’s Government Media Office has updated its death toll to more than 61,700, saying thousands of others missing under the rubble are presumed dead.Israel has halted the entry of food, medication and all other essentials into Gaza since March 2, saying that the blockade, alongside “military pressure”, is intended to force Hamas to free the remaining captives.However, senior Hamas official Basem Naim reiterated on Thursday the group’s position that the entry of aid into Gaza is a prerequisite for any talks with Israel.“Access to food, water and medicine is a fundamental human right – not a subject for negotiation,” he added.The US and Israel are preparing a plan that they say will allow the resumption of aid by an NGO, while keeping supplies out of Hamas’s hands.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has said it will begin distributing aid this month. However, the United Nations and other aid organisations have ruled out involvement in the initiative, saying it does not respect the impartiality, neutrality and independence of aid operations.However, the US is pushing on, apparently keen to “get involved” in Gaza, as Trump put it during his trip to the region.Speaking in the United Arab Emirates on Friday, the US president said: “We’re looking at Gaza. And we’re going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving.”The previous day, however, he reiterated his idea of having the US take over Gaza and pushing Palestinians out of the enclave.“I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good … let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,” he said, adding that he would be “proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone”.The comments echoed a widely condemned idea he floated in February for the US to “take over” the devastated territory and redevelop it into “the Riviera of the Middle East”.In response, Hamas official Naim said that the territory is “not for sale”.“Gaza is an integral part of Palestinian land,” he declared. “It is not real estate for sale on the open market.”","Gaza death toll passes 53,000 as Israel drives towards ‘conquest’","2025-06-28T10:49:21.839353Z"

The question will likely eventually be decided by the US Supreme Court.The administration has further relied on the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to justify its actions. An obscure provision of the law allows the US secretary of state to deport any non-citizen deemed to have “potentially serious adverse foreign consequences”.In a separate ruling related to Columbia University Student Mahmoud Kahlil in April, a federal judge adopted a broad interpretation of the provision, saying Kahlil was deportable based on Rubio’s claims he took part in “anti-Semitic” protests. That came despite the top US diplomat providing no further evidence.Similarly, the Department of Homeland Security had previously claimed in a post on X that Khan Suri was “spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media”.It added he “was married to the daughter of a senior advisor for to Hamas terrorist group”.But speaking to reporters, Nermeen Arastu, one of the lawyers representing Khan Suri, noted that evidence backing up those claims has not been presented by government lawyers in court.Arastu, who is also an associate professor of law at the CUNY School of Law, said it was notable that “the court today also pointed out that the government is kind of throwing around accusations in social media, but not presenting them in the formal courtroom setting”.“And tied that to this due process concept that’s so important here to understand – that at the very basic level, you have a right to understand the allegations that are being brought against you,” she said.Critics have further accused the Trump administration of targeting Khan Suri based on his familial ties. His wife is the daughter of Ahmed Yousef, a former adviser to assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh who left his position with the armed group more than a decade ago.“He should have never been arrested and jailed for his constitutionally protected speech just because the government disagrees with him,” ACLU of Virginia senior immigrants’ rights lawyer Sophia Gregg, told reporters on Wednesday.“He should have never been punished for his relationship with his wife or his father-in-law,” she said.Like in the cases of Ozturk and Mahdawi, Khan Suri’s cases will proceed despite his release. He faces two separate legal proceedings, one in immigration court in the one challenging his arrest and detention in Virginia.He remained in detention in Texas when the ruling was issued on Wednesday, his lawyers said, adding they were expecting him to be released shortly.Saleh said at the court that she had recently spoken to her husband from the detention centre in Texas, where he was held.“He told me if my suffering in the detention centre is because I married a Palestinian and because I spoke out against the genocide in Gaza, then I should wear it as a badge of honour,” she said.","US judge orders release of Badar Khan Suri from immigration custody","2025-07-14T21:35:48.821859Z"

The attack never came.Whether these erratic actions are a reaction to the announced US ceasefire remains to be seen, but many analysts have spoken of a widening rift between Netanyahu and Trump.Netanyahu has reportedly expressed his frustration with Trump’s Middle East policy in private conversations.He has been publicly against the US administration’s talks with Iran, claiming there is no diplomatic way to resolve differences with Tehran, yet Iran and the US have continued their talks.He went on to blame Iran for the Houthis’ attacks, claiming Israel’s attacks are a message to the “Houthis’ sponsors”.Trump, for his part, has seemed unconcerned.“It’s worth noting Trump didn’t say anything about [Houthi] attacks on Israel, which seem to be continuing amid this escalation,” Nicholas Brumfield, a Yemen analyst, told Al Jazeera.“In [this] case, it’s a US drawdown because the Houthis haven’t been attacking international shipping,” Brumfield said. “They’ve been attacking Israel. The US has been doing its thing, and the Houthis have been targeting US ships.”After Israeli attacks on Monday and Tuesday, which killed at least three people and wounded 35 others and damaged Hodeidah Port and Sanaa Airport, the Houthis promised retaliation.The attacks “will not go unanswered”, the Houthi political bureau said in a statement.That kind of statement is typical of the Houthis, who have managed to weather more than a decade of attacks by forces with far superior military capabilities.Air strikes by the US and United Kingdom on Yemen in early 2024 were unable to stop the Houthis’ attacks on Red Sea traffic.Years of air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition supporting Yemen’s internationally recognised government taught the Houthis to keep their military infrastructure agile, analysts told Al Jazeera.A senior US government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera that recent US attacks on the Houthis have pushed leaders underground after the killing of some key military commanders.However, unlike under US President Joe Biden’s administration, the attacks under Trump have been indiscriminate and have led to more civilian deaths. More than 250 people have been killed by US attacks on Yemen since mid-March, including at least 68 people at a centre housing detained African refugees and migrants in late April.Experts told Al Jazeera that despite the increased ferocity of those attacks, the Houthis have not been deterred.“The Houthis aren’t going to stop,” Brumfield said.The Houthis have made their stance clear vis-à-vis the agreement with the US and the continuation of attacks on Israel, which has also made clear that it plans to keep attacking.“The stated aim is to deter [the Houthis] or deplete their military capabilities to the point that the Houthis cannot target Israel any more, but these are both very unrealistic goals,” Hannah Porter, an independent Yemen analyst, told Al Jazeera.Israel already considers that it has diminished the capabilities of two of its biggest foes, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, over the past 19 months.But trying something like that on the Houthis would be a vastly different challenge, she said.“Israel has probably not gathered the amount of intel on the Houthis that they have on Hamas or Hezbollah, so tracking and targeting leaders will be harder,” Porter said.“More importantly, the geographic area is much larger in northern Yemen, meaning that there are far more potential targets.”“The terrain is a factor, too,” she added. “Northern Yemen is very mountainous with plenty of places to hide people and weapons.”For now, Israel and the Houthis seem intent on continuing their exchange of attacks. And the first to suffer will be the people of Yemen.Israel struck numerous targets in recent days in Yemen, including Sanaa’s airport and the port in Hodeidah, which experts said is likely to exacerbate Yemen’s dire humanitarian situation.Israel destroyed at least three civilian planes in the attacks.Yemen is already suffering one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. More than 18.2 million people require humanitarian assistance and protection services, according to the United Nations.More than 17.1 million Yemenis suffer acute food shortages, and about five million are on the brink of famine.While analysts said Israel’s attacks on ports will not be a “knockout blow”, they are among a matrix of factors that leave many Yemenis in an increasingly precarious position.“The humanitarian situation will just get worse,” Raiman Al-Hamdani, a Yemen researcher with the international development company ARK, told Al Jazeera.“Destroying the two main ports of northern Yemen, where the majority of the population lives, coupled with the FTO [“foreign terrorist organisation”] designation with cuts to the aid system around the world and the deteriorating economy … is a recipe for [unprecedented] humanitarian disaster.”“[Israel’s attacks] are a continuation of its strategy. It’s out of spite, targets civil infrastructure and the policy of creating human suffering,” Al-Hamdani said.Both sides seem unwilling to stop, however.“I cannot see anything quite good coming out of this unless the war Israel is waging on Gaza comes to some form of truce,” Al-Hamdani said.","Do Israel’s attacks make a difference to Yemen’s Houthis?","2025-07-15T20:31:04.678496Z"

At least 22 Palestinians were killed in a series of attacks on Friday, medical sources in Gaza told Al Jazeera. They include a mother and child in Al Nuseirat Refugee Camp in central Gaza, and a father and son killed in Khan Younis in the south.US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told reporters on Friday that Israel would not be involved in distributing aid in the enclave but would provide security for the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).The plan for the “charitable” and “non-governmental” initiative was announced on Thursday by State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce. Although few details were revealed, it appears part of a US-Israeli push to take over the distribution of aid to prevent it from being diverted by Hamas and other groups.The AP news agency reported that the newly created GHF had issued a proposal to implement a new aid distribution system, supplanting the current one run by the United Nations and other international aid agencies.Reports claim that under the proposal, private contractors will be used to secure hubs where Palestinians will be required to gather to collect supplies.Israel, which has halted the entry of all aid to Gaza since March 2, deepening the humanitarian crisis, has previously said it will not relax the blockade until a system is in place that gives it control over the distribution, insisting that supplies are used to support Hamas.The intention to sideline the UN has drawn sharp criticism from humanitarian organisations, and it is unclear if the GHF proposal will ease those concerns.“There’s only one word to describe this, and this is aid-washing. This is a cynical attempt by the state of Israel and its allies … to use aid to hide the fact that what’s actually going on is people are being starved into submission,” Chris Gunness, a former UNWRA – the UN agency for Palestinian refugees – spokesperson, told Al Jazeera.“They’re being starved as a part of the mass and illegal force displacement, which is very much part of Israel’s genocidal ambitions against the Palestinians.”Gunness added that the proposal is also an “attempt by Israel to destroy UNRWA”, stating that UNRWA is the only organisation that has the infrastructure, the staff, the vehicles, the food distribution centres and warehouses “to stave off mass starvation in Gaza”.The US State Department’s Bruce promised further announcements regarding the proposal would follow soon.“I was hoping to introduce it today, but the foundation will be announcing this shortly,” she said.The former executive director of the UN World Food Programme David Beasley is in talks with the US, Israel and other key players to head the GHF, reported US outlet Axis, quoting unnamed sources.Israel’s blockade, implemented about two weeks before it resumed its bombardment of the enclave, has left Gaza’s 2.3 million Palestinians, most of whom have been displaced multiple times, desperately short of food, fuel, and medicine.The US plan appears to be designed along similar lines to a proposal approved by Israel’s security cabinet on Sunday.Under the scheme, four “Secure Distribution Sites” would be constructed, each intended to serve 300,000 people. Palestinians expelled from northern Gaza would be forced to relocate to reach the centres.The plan was met by sharp criticism from the UN and other aid groups, who noted that Palestinians have regularly come under attack from Israeli forces while collecting aid.Addressing those concerns, Huckabee on Friday said “the most significant danger is not doing anything” and “people dying from hunger”.The aid would be “distributed effectively, but also safely”, the US official insisted, according to Israeli daily Haaretz.The decision to bypass international aid agencies comes amid growing alarm over famine-like conditions in the besieged territory, where Israel’s near-total blockade has cut off all essential supplies for almost three months.At least 57 Palestinians have starved to death in Gaza, with most of the victims being children, as well as the sick and elderly.UN humanitarian agency spokesperson Jens Laerke condemned the effort to dismantle existing aid structures on Tuesday.“This appears to be a deliberate attempt to weaponise the aid,” he said. “It should be based solely on humanitarian need.”","US foundation eyes takeover of Gaza aid","2025-07-15T20:38:31.523940Z"

The Trump administration has accused Ozturk of having “engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans”, though it has not offered evidence.After she was detained outside her home, Ozturk was reportedly whisked across state borders, first to Vermont and later to Louisiana, all within a 24-hour period, according to her lawyers.Critics have described those rapid transfers as a means of subverting due process, separating foreign students from family, friends and legal resources they can otherwise draw upon.In Ozturk’s case, the confusion led her lawyers to file a petition for her release in Massachusetts, as they did not know where she was when they submitted the paperwork.On April 18, a lower court ruled that Ozturk must be returned to Vermont no later than May 1, as it weighed her habeas petition: a type of complaint that challenges the legality of one’s detention.“No one should be arrested and locked up for their political views. Every day that Rumeysa Ozturk remains in detention is a day too long,” Bhandari, her lawyer, said in a statement.But the Trump administration appealed, seeking an emergency stay of Ozturk’s transfer to Vermont.The Second Circuit Court of Appeals rejected (PDF) that request, however. It said the government had failed to show any “irreparable harm” that Ozturk’s transfer would cause.“Faced with such a conflict between the government’s unspecific financial and administrative concerns on the one hand, and the risk of substantial constitutional harm to Ozturk on the other, we have little difficulty concluding ‘that the balance of hardships tips decidedly’ in her favor,” the court wrote.Though Ozturk is expected to be transferred to Vermont, where her habeas petition will be heard, the Trump administration is slated to continue with deportation proceedings in Louisiana.The appeals court, however, explained that this should be no challenge for the Trump administration, given that Ozturk can appear through video conference for those hearings.“The government asserts that it would face difficulties in arranging for Ozturk to appear for her immigration proceedings in Louisiana remotely,” the court wrote. “But the government has not disputed that it is legally and practically possible for Ozturk to attend removal proceedings remotely.”The Trump administration has the option of appealing the decision to the Supreme Court.Likewise, Khalil faces deportation proceedings in Louisiana while his habeas petition is heard in New Jersey, closer to his home in New York City.On March 8, he became the first high-profile case of a student protester being arrested for deportation. Agents for Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrived at his student housing building at Columbia University, where his wife, a US citizen, filmed him being handcuffed and led away.Khalil himself was a US permanent resident who recently graduated from Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs. He is of Palestinian descent.On Tuesday, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in New Jersey rejected a bid by the Trump administration to transfer Khalil’s habeas petition to Louisiana.And on Wednesday, US District Court Judge Michael Farbiarz ordered the Trump administration to provide a specific assessment of the risks Khalil poses by being in the US.Trump’s Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cited Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to justify Khalil’s detention and deportation. A rarely used provision of the law allows secretaries of state to remove noncitizens who could cause “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences”.But Rubio has so far been vague about what those consequences might be in Khalil’s case. The student protest leader has been charged with no crime.Judge Farbiarz also required the Trump team to supply a catalogue of every case in which US officials have employed that law. The Trump administration is expected to appeal that judge’s order as well.","US court says student activist Rumeysa Ozturk must be sent to Vermont","2025-07-15T20:36:26.705757Z"

Because of severe malnutrition, she suffered from blood acidity, liver and kidney failure, and many other complications. Her hair and nails also fell out due to malnutrition.”According to leaked plans, Israel’s government reportedly wants to severely restrict the way food is distributed in Gaza and is proposing that United States companies take over distribution from the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies.Under the plan, Palestinian families would be allowed to take one food parcel a week in designated hubs in southern Gaza, and Israel would permit 60 trucks to enter the Gaza Strip every day – just one-tenth of what’s needed, according to experts.Aid groups in the UN have rejected this plan, saying it’s a pressure tactic to further reinforce control over life-saving supplies.","No sense in Gaza ceasefire talks amid Israel’s ‘hunger war’: Hamas","2025-06-28T10:04:59.408398Z"

The claim could not be independently verified.Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported that six Israeli strikes hit Hodeidah’s port and blamed both Israel and the United States. Axios quoted a senior US official who said the air raids were coordinated between Israel and the US.A US defence source told Al Jazeera that “US forces did not participate in the Israeli strikes on Yemen today” but did not deny nonlethal support may have been provided.The attack was carried out after a ballistic missile fired from Yemen on Sunday struck close to Ben Gurion International Airport outside Tel Aviv.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had pledged retaliation for the Houthi attack, the first known missile to avoid interception since the Yemeni group began targeting Israel in November 2023.Al Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem reported that about 30 Israeli warplanes took part in Monday’s operation, which was overseen by Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz from a command centre in Tel Aviv.Hashem said the strikes mark a “new phase” in Israeli attacks on Yemen.Since President Donald Trump returned to power in January, the US has embarked on a more aggressive assault on Yemen “which is related directly to Israeli interests”, Hashem added.This is not the first time Israel has bombed targets in Yemen. In December, air raids struck the Ras Isa oil terminal and other sites in Hodeidah province, killing at least nine people.While most Houthi-launched projectiles have been intercepted, Sunday’s attack was the “most significant strike”, Hashem said, since the group launched its campaign in November 2023, which it said is in response to Israel’s war on Gaza and to show solidarity with Palestinians. A drone had previously hit a building in Tel Aviv last year.Since November 2023, the Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, have launched more than 100 drone and missile attacks targeting vessels they said are linked to Israel in the Red Sea.Although the Houthis paused attacks during a frail ceasefire in Gaza this year, they resumed their operations after Israel cut off humanitarian aid to Gaza and resumed its offensive in March.","Israel bombs Yemen’s Hodeidah port after attack near Tel Aviv airport","2025-07-15T17:46:46.239452Z"

You are allowed to disagree and protest,” Kirk wrote on X on Sunday. “We’ve allowed far too many people who hate America move here from abroad, but the right to speak freely is the birthright of all Americans.”Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser and influential right-wing media personality, backed the comments of Kirk and Greene, writing on the social media platform Gettr, “Fact check: True” and “Agreed” in response to their statements, respectively.The proposed legislation was introduced by pro-Israel hawks in the US Congress, Republican Mike Lawler and Democrat Josh Gottheimer, in January, and has been co-sponsored by 22 other lawmakers from both major parties.The bill would expand a 2018 law that bans coercive boycotts imposed by foreign governments to include international governmental organisations (IGOs).The original legislation prohibits boycotting a country friendly to the US based on an “agreement with, a requirement of, or a request from or on behalf” of another nation. It imposes penalties of up to $1m and 20 years in prison for violations.Expanding the legislation to include IGOs risks penalising individuals and companies in the US that boycott firms listed by the United Nations as doing business in illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.While the bill itself does not explicitly mention Israel, its drafters have said that it targets the UN and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement, which calls for economic pressure on the Israeli government to end its abuses against Palestinians.“This change targets harmful and inherently anti-Semitic BDS efforts at IGOs, such as the UN, by extending protections already in place for boycotts instigated by foreign countries,” Lawler’s office said in January.States and the federal government have been passing anti-BDS laws for years, raising the alarm about the violation of free speech rights, which are guaranteed by the First Amendment of the US Constitution.Numerous legal cases have challenged these laws, and some judges have ruled that they are unconstitutional, while others have upheld them.Rights groups and Palestinian rights advocates have argued that anti-boycott laws aim to shut down the debate about Israel and criminalise peaceful resistance against its violations of international law.Over the years, leading UN agencies and rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have accused Israel of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including imposing apartheid on Palestinians.But supporters of anti-BDS laws say the measures are designed to combat discrimination against Israel and regulate trade, not speech.Such laws have mainly faced opposition from progressive Democrats, but the IGO Anti-Boycott Act has generated anger from right-wing politicians, too.“Americans have the right to boycott, and penalizing this risks free speech. I reject and vehemently condemn antisemitism but I cannot violate the first amendment,” Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, wrote on X.The right-wing rejection of the Lawler-Gottheimer bill comes as the Trump administration continues with its push to target criticism of and protests against Israel, especially on college campuses.Since Trump took office, the US government has revoked the visas of hundreds of students for activism against Israel’s war on Gaza.Several students, including legal permanent residents, have been jailed over allegations of anti-Semitism and “spreading Hamas propaganda”.Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University, has been detained since March, and the only known allegation against her is co-authoring an op-ed calling on her college to honour the student senate’s call for divesting from Israeli companies.Trump has also frozen and threatened to freeze federal funding for several universities, including Harvard, over pro-Palestine protests.","US bill to ban Israel boycotts faces right-wing backlash over free speech","2025-07-15T20:48:14.580963Z"

We are increasing the pressure to return our people [held captive in Gaza] and defeat Hamas,” Zamir said, adding that the Israeli military would “operate in additional areas and destroy all of [Hamas’s] infrastructure above and below ground”.The military chief made the announcement during a visit to the Atlit naval base on Israel’s northern Mediterranean coast.The announcement came before a Netanyahu-chaired security cabinet meeting to discuss an expansion of the war in Gaza, which began in October 2023 and has decimated the Palestinian enclave.A growing movement within Israel has called for an end to the war, and an increasing number of reservists are ignoring call-ups.Two government officials told the Reuters news agency that the cabinet would also discuss the possible resumption of aid to Gaza as humanitarian groups warn of increased starvation in the territory since Israel imposed a total blockade on March 2.Israel continues to face widespread global outrage over the conduct of its war in Gaza, which has shattered the territory’s infrastructure as well as its healthcare system and displaced the vast majority of its 2.3 million residents at least once since the war began.Far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, in an interview with Israeli Army Radio, said he wanted to see a “powerful” expansion of the war but did not disclose details as to what new plans might entail.“We need to increase the intensity and continue until we achieve total victory. We must win a total victory,” he said. He demanded that Israel bomb “the food and electricity supplies” in Gaza.Leading humanitarian groups, including the Red Cross, have warned that the humanitarian response in Gaza is on the verge of “total collapse” and Palestinians face a “daily struggle to survive” amid bombardment and the crippling blockade.United Nations agencies have said truck convoys carrying aid are building up at the border and have not been allowed into the enclave, where a famine is looming.Israeli officials claim an expanded military offensive would pressure Hamas into releasing the 59 remaining captives, but critics argue it further endangers their lives. Israel ending the fragile ceasefire, which saw Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Israeli captives, on March 18 has not led to any more releases.The reserve call-ups are going out as Netanyahu promised to respond to Yemen’s Houthis after the rebels fired a missile that struck a road at Israel’s Ben Gurion International Airport, wounding six people and prompting several major airlines to suspend flights.Netanyahu said the response will take place “at a time and place of our choosing”.The Houthis have said their fighters carried out the assault “in support of the oppressed Palestinian people” and to counter Israel’s “crime of genocide” in Gaza.","Israel calling up tens of thousands of reservists to expand war on Gaza","2025-07-15T17:51:00.267553Z"

Eight people were injured, according to paramedics.Israeli media reported that the advanced US-made THAAD system and Israel’s long-range Arrow defence system failed to bring down the missile.Writing on social media, Netanyahu said that attacks from the Houthis ultimately “emanate from Iran”.“Israel will respond to the Houthi attack against our main airport AND, at a time and place of our choosing, to their Iranian terror masters,” Netanyahu wrote.The Israeli prime minister has been trying to drum up support for a joint attack with the United States against Iran, despite ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran.Responding to Israel’s threats, Iran’s Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh said that Tehran would strike back if the US or Israel attacked.“If this war is intiated by the US or the Zionist regime [Israel], Iran will target their interests, bases and forces – wherever they may be and whenever deemed necessary,” Nasirzadeh told Iranian state television.Nasirzadeh also said that Yemen’s Houthis made their own decisions when conducting attacks.The rebel group, which has been carrying out attacks against Israel in stated opposition to its war and blockade on the Gaza Strip, claimed responsibility for the missile launched at Israel’s busiest airport. More than 18 months of Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed at least  52,495 people, including 57 who starved to death due to the total Israeli siege since March 2, according to Palestinian officials.In a televised statement, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree warned airlines that Ben Gurion airport was “no longer safe for air travel”.The attack led to a brief suspension of flights at the airport in central Israel with some having to be redirected. All entrances to the airport were also briefly closed while train journeys towards the site were halted.A number of major airlines, including German carrier Lufthansa, Spanish airline Air Europa, Air France, SWISS, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Air India and Hungary’s Wizz Air announced they were cancelling flights for Sunday, with some cancelling flights on Monday and Tuesday as well.The Houthis called on airlines flying to Israel to “take into consideration” that it would “impose a comprehensive air blockade on [Israel] by repeatedly targeting… Ben-Gurion Airport”.Sirens blared across central Israel, prompting many to move into shelters, according to Israeli media.Videos of the site of the impact circulating online showed the missile hit a connecting road inside the perimeter of the airport with some debris scattered on adjacent roads.Before his social media post, Netanyahu had promised to retaliate against the Houthis and continue the war on Gaza.In a video message in Hebrew, he said Israel and the US will “act against them again in the future” and do so using more than one blow. He also vowed “there will be no Hamas” in Gaza.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened severe retaliation, too. “Whoever attacks us, we will hit back sevenfold,” Katz said in an apparent reference in the Torah relating to severe punishment, or divine justice.Benny Gantz, leader of the Israel Resilience party and a former war cabinet member, said the blame for the missile attack by the Iran-aligned group should be put on Tehran.“It is Iran that is firing ballistic missiles at the state of Israel, and it must bear responsibility,” he said in a social media post without providing evidence. “The shooting at the state of Israel is bound to lead to a severe reaction in Tehran.”Yair Golan, a leading opposition figure, said millions of Israelis are in shelters again, Israeli captives held in Gaza are dying, the cost of living is crushing families and reservists are “collapsing under the burden” of the war, which was launched after an attack headed by the Palestinian armed group Hamas in Israel on October 7, 2023, led to the killing of an estimated 1,139 people, with more than 200 taken captive.“This is big for Netanyahu, this is big for the government,” Golan said about the prime minister. “We must return the kidnapped people home and end the war.”Houthi attacks are continuing despite near daily bombardment of areas across Yemen by the United States military. Houthi-run media reported many more US air raids on Yemen early on Sunday, as well as after the attack on Ben Gurion airport.After the missile hit the airport, Al Masirah TV reported US air raids on the Khab and ash-Shaaf district of al-Jawf governorate.At dawn, US warplanes launched 10 raids on the al-Hazm district of the al-Jawf governorate and three attacks on the Marib governorate. More attacks hit Saada’s Takhya region as well.It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties as with some of the other US strikes this week, including one on a migrant detention centre that killed dozens of people.","Israel’s Netanyahu vows response to Iran after Houthi attack on airport","2025-07-15T17:45:31.859391Z"

Orthopaedic surgeon Anas Hijjawi described a long line of doctors who had signed up for medical missions to Gaza, some of whom had to wait up to five months for a spot on a mission to open up.Dr Diyaa Rachdan, an ophthalmic surgeon, struggles to keep his voice steady as he tells Al Jazeera that Tuesday was the last day of the mission and the doctors would be heading back to their respective hospitals the next day.“But I am hoping that there will be more, longer trips to Gaza in the future,” he adds.Their work in Gaza is not easy, but that is not the reason these doctors are sad to be leaving their mission behind. On the contrary, every day is a struggle as they try to cope with a volume of deaths, illnesses and injuries they simply do not have the equipment to address.Israel has often prevented the entry of hospital supplies into Gaza during the course of its nearly 19-month-long war on the besieged enclave. Medical missions are not allowed to bring anything in with them.So, the doctors struggle on with the equipment they can find, sometimes reusing “disposable” medical implements over and over, despite the danger that poses, because there is simply no other choice, Dr Rachdan says.At the back of their minds, several doctors tell Al Jazeera, is always the thought that people in Gaza die of wounds and illnesses that would be easily treated in any other hospital that has adequate supplies.“Sometimes we can’t cover a patient or take precautions to preserve the sterility of an operating room,” Dr Hijjawi says.“Sometimes I don’t have the right size metal plates or screws that I need to mend a limb. I’ve had to use the wrong size item … just to get them better enough that they could, some day, travel for more treatment.”While doctors coming into Gaza have often followed developments there closely before arrival, nothing, they tell Al Jazeera, could have prepared them for the level of destruction the people of Gaza have to cope with.“Words can’t describe the pain people are in here, or the level of exhaustion of the medical teams. They’ve been working nearly around the clock for a year and a half now, despite their own personal pain and tragedies,” says the fourth Qatar-based volunteer, urology consultant Mohammad Almanaseer.There’s a tentativeness in Dr Almanaseer’s voice as he speaks of the case that has impacted him the most deeply, the story of a little boy of about two years old who was brought into the emergency room after Israel had bombed him and his family.“The usual resuscitation attempts were made with him, but he needed immediate surgery. I was in the operating room, assisting the paediatric surgeon, but it became clear to us that the child probably wouldn’t survive.”The child died the next morning.“He was the same age as my son, and even had the same name. Kinan, little Kinan, may God receive you and your mother, who was killed in the same bombing, by his side.”Injuries as extreme and urgent as Kinan’s are what the medical teams deal with day in and day out, resulting in a large swath of patients who need less urgent care and who keep getting pushed down the list.Like the patients who have been waiting for months or years for cataract surgery, some of whom were helped by Dr Rachdan during this mission.The people of Gaza have been forced to carry on throughout the genocidal war on their existence. This strength has inspired a sort of bewildered regard among the visiting volunteer doctors.Dr Hijjawi tells of an afternoon chat with an operating room nurse who was explaining how he struggles to get to work every day and how he says a final farewell to his wife and children every day, because he never knows what may happen to any of them.“Then, we heard ambulances coming in,” Dr Hijjawi continues, “and we went to muster in the emergency room. Suddenly, the OR nurse came running past us, desperately asking for an ambulance to go to his house with him because he had heard it had been bombed.“It took some time … but they finally went out and came back with his parents, who had been killed, and the rest of his family, who had injuries among them. And, you know what? Just two days after this happened to him, he’s here, he’s upstairs working.”All four doctors seem to have a soft spot for their paediatric patients. It is the children’s pain that affects them the most, and it is their suffering that they will take away with them in their memories.Al Jazeera follows Dr Almanaseer on his rounds as he visits a young girl in intensive care. She is recovering from severe burns on much of her face and body. In quiet tones, she asks him about whether she will be left with big scars from the burns.The doctor answers her quietly and seriously, taking time to talk to her until it seems like she’s reassured for today.Dr Hijjawi is also on his rounds, speaking to a little girl, gently examining her leg and asking her to “lift both feet off the bed for me”. Then he asks a little boy to wiggle his toes so he can check on how he’s healing.Next is a young girl lying under a recovery blanket in a room on her own. Her right arm is bandaged, which is what he’s there to look at.He squats on the floor near her bed and moves her arm, then each of her fingers. He’s concerned because she seems to have lost sensation in two fingers and feels the problem will have to be explored surgically, as he tells a concerned relative.The children are quiet, wide-eyed, doing as they’re told and not saying much else.“There’s so much they’re dealing with,’ Hijjawi says. “Being in the hospital is scary, but on top of that, so many of them are just lying there waiting, hoping, for someone to visit them – a parent or grandparent or sibling. Some of them don’t know who’s left alive from their family outside the hospital walls.“Add all that to their physical pain, yes, they are very quiet for very long periods, or their minds seem to wander,” he says quietly.Dr Rachdan is holding fast to one memory of Gaza’s children that he seems to want to preserve as he gets ready to leave: “One thing that I don’t think I will ever forget is the sight of the children in Gaza who continue playing, despite the destruction.“They make paper aeroplanes, play ball, despite the tragedy they are surrounded by. I will always remember that.”","Fear, pain, and a little hope: Volunteer doctors in Gaza","2025-07-15T20:47:01.899085Z"

But it has not led to any more releases since the fleeting ceasefire earlier this year, which saw Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Israeli captives.Meanwhile, Hamas official Abdel Rahman Shadid on Friday accused Israel of using starvation as a “deliberate weapon of war” against Palestinians.“Children are dying from the lack of milk, not just from bombs,” Shadid said in a statement published on the group’s Telegram channel.Legal experts and human rights groups have noted that, as an occupying power, Israel has an obligation under international law to provide food and other assistance to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.They have condemned the blockade as a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians of all ages are experiencing high levels of food insecurity in Gaza, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system, a global hunger watchdog.Amjad Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, told Al Jazeera that the situation is worsening quickly as health facilities lack the supplies needed to treat children grappling with malnutrition.“We have no food supplies or supplementary materials or medications for these children,” Shawa told Al Jazeera from Gaza City. “There is high concern that we will witness more casualties in the coming few days,” he added.At Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, Dr Ahmed Abu Nasir said the situation has become worse than ever due to the blockade.“Children are in their growing stage and badly need certain nutrients, including proteins and fats,” the paediatrician told Al Jazeera. “These are not available in the Gaza Strip, particularly in the north.”More than 52,400 Palestinians have been killed since Israel’s war on Gaza began in October 2023, according to figures from the Gaza Health Ministry.","Palestinian children face starvation under Israel’s total Gaza blockade","2025-06-28T09:59:03.917724Z"

He also issued decrees to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement on climate and the World Health Organization, amongst other international forums.Trump continued to double down on a series of unconventional foreign policy proposals: taking over the Panama Canal, annexing Greenland, making Canada the 51st US state and “owning” Gaza.And despite promising to be a “peace” president, Trump has said he intends to take the US annual Pentagon budget to a record $1 trillion.He has distanced himself from neo-conservative foreign policy and does not position himself as a promoter of human rights or democracy abroad. His “America First” stance and scepticism of NATO align with realist principles, but his impulsiveness and highly personalised diplomacy diverge from traditional realism.At the same time, he has not called for a full military or diplomatic retreat from global affairs, setting him apart from isolationists.So what exactly drives Trump’s foreign policy?Experts say it is primarily fuelled by a dissatisfaction with the current global system, which he sees as unfairly disadvantaging the US with its rules and restrictions. Instead, Trump appears to want Washington to leverage its enormous military and economic power to set the rules to assert global dominance while reducing US contributions and commitments to others.“The Trump doctrine is ‘smash and grab’, take what you want from others and let your allies do the same,” said Josh Ruebner, a lecturer at Georgetown University’s Program on Justice and Peace.Mathew Burrows, programme lead of the Strategic Foresight Hub at the Stimson Center think tank, said Trump wants US primacy without paying the costs that come with that.“He’s withdrawing the US from the rest of the world, particularly economically,” Burrows, a veteran of the US Department of State and CIA, told Al Jazeera.“But at the same time, he somehow believes that the US … will be able to tell other countries to stop fighting, to do whatever the US wants,” he said. “Hegemony just doesn’t work that way.”Trump appears to believe that threatening and imposing tariffs – and occasionally violence – is a way of employing US leverage to get world leaders to acquiesce to his demands.But critics say the US president discounts the power of nationalism in other countries, which prompts them to eventually fight back. Such was the case for Canada.After Trump imposed tariffs and called for Canada to become the 51st state, this led to a wave of nationalist pride in the northern neighbour and an abrupt shift from the Conservative Party to the Liberal Party.From Canada to China, foreign governments have accused Trump of “bullying” and blackmail.Some of Trump’s Democratic rivals have rushed to accuse him of abandoning the US global role, but at the same time, the US president has been projecting American strength to pressure other countries.While not entirely isolationist, his approach marks a significant turn from that of his predecessor.The late Secretary of State Madeleine Albright famously said in 1998: “We are the indispensable nation. We stand tall and we see further than other countries into the future.”That purported power and wisdom, as Albright envisioned, put the US in a position to implement Pax Americana – the concept of a peaceful global order led by Washington.Trump does see the US as proverbially taller than other nations, but perhaps not in the way Albright meant.“America does not need other countries as much as other countries need us,” White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier this month.Her statement, however, was to stress that other nations must negotiate with the US to avoid Trump’s tariffs.In this context, Trump is seeking revenues and jobs – not an international system governed by liberal values in the way that Washington defines them.However, Burrows said the chief aim of Trump’s foreign policy is to dismantle the existing global order.“A big part of his world view is really his negative feelings towards the current order, where others appear to be rising,” Burrows said. “And so, a lot of this is just tearing down.”Much of the system that manages relations between different countries was put in place after World War II, with the US leading the way.The United Nations and its agencies, the articles of international law, various treaties on the environment, nuclear proliferation and trade, and formal alliances have governed global affairs for decades.Critics of Washington point out that the US violated and opted out of the system where it saw fit.For example, the US never joined the Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court in 1998. It invaded Iraq in 2003 without United Nations Security Council authorisation in an apparent breach of the UN Charter. And it has been providing unconditional support to Israel despite the US ally’s well-documented abuses against Palestinians.“The United States has done a lot to stand up sort of multilateral institutions – the UN and others – that are based around these ideas,” said Matthew Duss, the executive vice president at the Center for International Policy.“But the United States has always found ways to violate these norms and laws when it when it serves our purposes,” he added, pointing to former US President Joe Biden’s support for Israel’s war on Gaza and President George W Bush’s policies after the 9/11 attacks, which included extraordinary rendition, torture, invasion and prolonged occupation.But for Trump and his administration, there are indications that the global order is not just to be worked around; it needs to go.“The post-war global order is not just obsolete, it is now a weapon being used against us,” Trump’s Secretary of State Marco Rubio told senators during his confirmation hearing in January.Trump recently told Time Magazine that the US has been “ripped off” by “almost every country in the world”.His rhetoric on foreign policy appears to echo his statements about promising to look after “America’s forgotten men and women” who have been mistreated by the “elites” domestically.While the modern world order has empowered US companies and left the country with immense wealth and military and diplomatic might, Americans do have major issues to complain about.Globalisation saw the outsourcing of US jobs to countries with less expensive labour. Past interventionist policies – particularly the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – are largely seen as strategic blunders that produced a generation of veterans with physical and mental injuries.Geoffrey Kabaservice, vice president of political studies at the Niskanen Center, a centre-right think tank in Washington, DC, noted that wages have stagnated for many Americans for decades.“The fact is that the benefits of globalisation were very maldistributed, and some people up at the top made enormous plutocratic sums of money, and very little of that flowed down to the mass of the working class,” Kabaservice told Al Jazeera.For people who saw their factories closed and felt like they were living in “left-behind areas”, electing Trump was “retribution” against the system, Kabaservice said, adding that Trump’s “America First” approach has pitted the US against the rest of the world.“America is turning its back on the world,” Kabaservice said. “Trump believes that America can be self-sufficient in all things, but already the falsity of this doctrine is proving true.”Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, a think tank that promotes diplomacy, said Trump’s foreign policy, including his approach to allies, comes from “the politics of grievance”.“He does believe that the United States – because of its role as world policeman, which he’s not necessarily in love with – has been shouldering a lot of the security burden of the world without getting proper compensation,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.The US president has been calling on NATO allies to increase their defence spending, while suggesting that Washington should be paid more for stationing troops in allied countries like Germany and South Korea.So how does Trump view the world?“He’s an aggressive unilateralist, and in many ways, he’s just an old-school imperialist,” Duss said of Trump. “He wants to expand American territory. He wants to extract wealth from other parts of the world … This is a kind of foreign policy approach from an earlier era.”He noted that Trump’s foreign policy is to act aggressively and unilaterally to achieve what he sees as US interests.Kabaservice said Trump wants the US to return to an age when it was a manufacturing powerhouse and not too involved in the affairs of the world.“He likes the idea that maybe the United States is a great power, sort of in a 19th-century model, and it lets the other great powers have their own sphere of influence,” he said.Kabaservice added that Trump wants the US to have “its own sphere of influence” and to be “expanding in the way that optimistic forward-moving powers are”.This notion of an America with its own “sphere of influence” appeared to be supported by Rubio when he spoke earlier this year of the inevitability of “multipolar world, multi-great powers in different parts of the planet”.Parsi said that Trump is seeking hemispheric hegemony above all, despite his aversion for regime change – hence his emphasis on acquiring Greenland and the Panama Canal.“You’re shifting not from the politics of domination towards restraint; you’re shifting from the politics of global domination to a more limited form of domination,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.“Focus only on your own hemisphere.”The US may have already experienced what happens when these views of nostalgia and grievance see real-world implications. Trump’s erratic trade policy rocked the US stock market and sparked threats of counter-levies from Canada to the European Union to China.Eventually, Trump postponed many of his tariffs, keeping a baseline of 10 percent levies and additional importing fees on Chinese goods. Asked why he suspended the measures, the US president acknowledged that it was due to how the tariffs were received. “People were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy,” he said.Ultimately, Trump’s unilateralism and unpredictability have “broken the world’s trust in significant ways” that will outlast his presidency, Kabaservice told Al Jazeera.“In the broad span of history, Trump will be seen as the person who committed terrible unforced errors that led to the end of the American century and the beginning of the Chinese century,” he said.During his inauguration speech earlier this year, the US president said his legacy “will be that of a peacemaker and unifier”.“His actual legacy will be that he has torn down the global system that the US created,” said Burrows, of the Stimson Center.","‘Tearing down’: What drives Trump’s foreign policy?","2025-06-28T10:42:41.246493Z"

Red lines don’t turn green overnight.”Amnesty also expressed concern about alleged human rights violations committed by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine and attacks on gender equality in Afghanistan and Iran.“The Taliban government criminalized the public existence of women and girls, passing so-called vice and virtue laws, denying their rights to work and education. Dozens of women protesters were forcibly disappeared or arbitrarily detained,” Callamard said.“In Iran, new compulsory veiling laws intensified oppression of women and girls, imposing flogging, exorbitant fines and harsh prison sentences, while officials and vigilantes who violently attack women and girls for defying the law continued with impunity.”","Israel carrying out ‘live-streamed genocide’ in Gaza, Amnesty says","2025-07-14T21:38:29.362614Z"

It was followed two weeks later by the collapse of a two-month ceasefire.“These are the facts. Starvation is here. Humanitarian aid is being used as a weapon of war,” Hijazi said.The ICJ has been tasked by the UN with providing an advisory opinion “on a priority basis and with the utmost urgency”.While no immediate ruling is expected, the court’s advisory opinion will likely shape future international legal approaches.However, it is nonbinding, meaning its impact depends on whether states choose to enforce or ignore it.The ruling “will likely be ignored by Israel, as it has done with other judgements from the ICJ, the International Criminal Court and other international legal bodies,” Al Jazeera’s Rory Challands said, reporting from The Hague.However, he added that “the tide of pressure is mounting” on Israel as a growing list of international courts have ruled against its actions.What the UN is saying, Challands noted, is that “Israel basically has a twofold obligation here under international law.

He was imprisoned by Israel as a teenager, spending 10 years behind bars, from 1978 to 1988.During his imprisonment, he learned Hebrew, a skill that would place him in a good position to negotiate with Israel later on.When he was released, he remained with Fatah and climbed the ranks.He is the father of four daughters and two sons.In the event of Abbas’s death or resignation, the deputy chair would be expected to become the acting head of the PLO and of the State of Palestine, which is recognised by nearly 150 countries.Concerns have been growing within the PLO that Israel might exploit Abbas’s departure and a possible power vacuum.Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim gave al-Sheikh’s appointment a frosty reception.“The Palestinian people are not a herd to have imposed upon them leaders with dubious history who have tied their present and future to the occupation,” he said in a statement.“Legitimacy is held only by the Palestinian people… The guardianship over our people is long gone.”The PLO is an umbrella organisation comprising several Palestinian political factions. But it excludes Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, which are currently fighting Israeli forces in Gaza and are at odds with Abbas.Founded in 1964, the PLO is empowered to negotiate and sign international treaties on behalf of the Palestinian people, while the PA is responsible for governing parts of the Palestinian territory, particularly the occupied West Bank.","Who is Hussein al-Sheikh, the new deputy to PLO’s Abbas?","2025-07-15T20:37:37.612453Z"

For many Palestinians in Gaza, community kitchens were their only source of nutrition after Israeli forces destroyed almost all food production facilities.WFP has appealed to the international community to put pressure on Israel to lift the blockade, saying more than 116,000 metric tonnes of food assistance – enough to feed one million people for up to four months – are already positioned for delivery “as soon as borders reopen”.Reporting from Deir el-Balah on Saturday, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said the humanitarian crisis in the besieged territory “has reached a very unprecedented breaking point”.“Civilians are really struggling to cope with this crisis,” he said.Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, said the crisis was “man-made”.Michael Fakhri, UN rapporteur on the right to food, said Israel is “executing this starvation campaign with no repercussions”.The World Health Organization said the situation was no different for medical supplies, with WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus pleading on X for the aid blockade to end.At least 2,062 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel resumed its deadly campaign against Hamas on March 18, and more than 50,000 since October 7, 2023.

Such an agreement would need to include guarantees that have so far proven non-starters, including a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.Under the previous six-week ceasefire agreement, Hamas released a total of 33 captives held in Gaza in exchange for an increase in humanitarian aid into the enclave and the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.A second phase, agreed to in principle, was meant to see the release of all remaining captives held in Gaza in exchange for a permanent end to fighting. A third phase was meant to see the release of all the bodies of captives and the implementation of a reconstruction plan.But negotiations broke down following the completion of the first phase of the agreement, with Israel immediately renewing attacks.

The bodies of 35 other captives are also believed to still be in the Palestinian enclave.Boehler, who held direct talks with Hamas officials in March, spoke to Al Jazeera after Hamas rejected a new Israeli ceasefire proposal calling for the group to fully disarm the day before.Hamas also claimed on Tuesday that it had lost contact with the group holding Israeli-American captive Edan Alexander after “direct Israeli bombardment” targeted the area where he was being held.Boehler dismissed the claim, saying he was certain Alexander was in a safe place and that Hamas would be “stupid” to harm him.If anything were to happen to Alexander, it’s “not going to be pretty”, he added, without elaborating.","US envoy says fighting in Gaza would ‘end immediately’ if captives released","2025-06-28T10:39:30.425185Z"

Alleged war crimes from October 7, 2023, to May 31 are documented in the file, which is based on open-source material and witness testimonies.Al Jazeera interviewed Mansfield about the landmark case, his views on Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and why he believes legal efforts against those involved in the onslaught remain important, even as critical rulings are ignored by those in power and mass killings continue unabated.Al Jazeera: What can you tell us about the case?Michael Mansfield: The reason I can’t talk about the detail of it is perhaps obvious: … The people [accused] would immediately know who they were.If a UK national commits any serious crime abroad, … you are liable to be and are investigated, arrested, charged and tried here in the United Kingdom. This is nothing out of the ordinary in that sense.The out-of-the-ordinary bit, of course, is that it is linked to war crimes and crimes against humanity, which are international crimes.The United Kingdom can obviously investigate themselves, or the International Criminal Court can investigate and charge and so forth.Nobody can be unaware of the extent of the devastation, particularly in Gaza, although that’s not the only place in the world where such things are happening. And in relation to those matters, the public are asking, “What are we doing about it? What can we do about it?”The international institutions of justice and conventions on human rights were established just after the Second World War in order to prevent this happening, if at all possible, by intervening.[But] the United Nations’s ability to intervene has been emasculated by the major nations – Russia and America nearly always opposing each other. On top of that, the United Kingdom sitting on the fence and abstaining on most of these issues.Slowly but surely, all the principles to do with the rule of law and rules-based democracy have been, essentially, denuded from practicality.The court finds it very difficult to do anything because the countries [allegedly behind war crimes] are seemingly immune. They don’t mind what the international courts may think – either the International Criminal Court [or the] International Court of Justice.Al Jazeera: As most monitors and observers are unable to enter Gaza presently due to the Israeli siege, how did the researchers and lawyers behind the report identify those accused?Mansfield: Linking the individual [to the alleged crimes] is the problem. You’ve got to be able to provide investigators with at least enough evidence for them to say this is worth investigating.They might say, “We can’t do this. It’s too difficult.” Then they might hand it over to the International Criminal Court, which has more resources.There’s something called the Berkeley Protocol, which is focused on how you would gather evidence from publicly available sources.Publicly available sources could be Al Jazeera [footage]. It could be somebody doing a selfie on their own phone.The research has already been done to ensure that the material on these 10 is sufficient for the police to take a decision whether they can do more or not.Al Jazeera: This month, Hungary withdrew from the International Criminal Court, which has issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu, ahead of a visit by the Israeli premier. If the global institutions that are meant to uphold human rights laws are under threat, decisions are sidestepped, and massacres continue in places like Gaza, what impact can legal efforts like yours have?Mansfield: I think they do make a difference for those of us who care.I mean, they don’t make a difference to the perpetrators. They never have. And that’s why they had the Nuremberg trials at the end of the Second World War.As a lawyer, I can’t just sit back and say I’ve wasted 55 years of my career. I’ve got to be able to say I have strived hard to get a situation in which people are made accountable.The law has been unable to deliver. The law is there, the institutions are there, but until governments … start paying respect to the rule of law and not ignoring it, there are lots of different ways in which people can be made accountable. As lawyers and as thinking members of the public, we have to be at the ready to get the authorities to actually do their job because if we don’t, no one else will, and it’ll just get worse.The basic freedoms you and I enjoy when we can – freedom of association, movement, speech and so on – they’re not divisible. What I mean by that is you might live on the other side of the world, but if it’s your rights being attacked in this way, it’s me as well. Make no mistake, when it’s happening there, it could be you next.That sort of approach to human rights is not a sort of woke topic that just a few liberal lawyers think of. It’s been fought hard for by other people. Lawyers in the past have fought very hard to set it all up.Al Jazeera: Do you classify what’s happening in Gaza as a genocide?I do, yes, no question.In this particular instance, if you’re attacked personally in the domestic sense or in any other, you’re entitled to defend yourself but only up to a point.If you’re attacked with somebody holding a wooden spoon, you can’t use a machinegun to kill them. … This has gone far beyond self-defence.Of course, they [aggressors, in this case Israel] will always justify it and say that it’s self-defence, but you only have to see what they’ve done.A lot of the victims are women and babies and children and doctors and journalists. … They are protected individuals under the law. If they’re not combatants, they’re not to be annihilated in this way.In my view, it’s clearly a genocide because they’ve [Israeli officials] made it very clear in various statements. They’re talking about a bigger Israel. There’s a political ambition that lies behind the whole thing, not for all, you know, members of the [Israeli military] and so on, but I think a sizeable proportion.[They] obviously are adhering to that principle that they want to see Gaza wiped off the map, and yes, they would like it reinstated as a Riviera resort of the Trump empire.It’s gone beyond plausible.[Note: The International Court of Justice said in January 2024 that it was plausible that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.]Al Jazeera: How will the world look back on this moment in history?Mansfield: I hope it will bring about change of some kind in people’s hearts and minds.The leaders of the world have the right to do something about it, and I think that our own prime minister [UK Premier Keir Starmer] should do more than he’s doing.Originally, we [the UK] objected to the issue of arrest warrants. However, that was the previous [Conservative] government and when [Labour’s] Starmer was elected, he changed that. He withdrew his objections on behalf of the United Kingdom, so that was one step in the right direction.I think we’ll look back and say, actually, thousands turn out for marches. Thousands of people are globally angry, upset and feeling hopeless, which is why keeping the law alive in the way the chief prosecutors tried to do, not just for Israel, but for other perpetrators as well, including [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and Russia and Ukraine.We’ve got to keep the caring alive. You can’t get away from it. You can’t hide in your bedroom and think, “Oh, I didn’t start this.” No, you didn’t, but if you’re a member of the human race, I’m afraid you have a responsibility.If I don’t spend every waking hour trying hard to keep what others set up in the first place [the rule of law], I feel I will have failed.You can’t just back away from it and hope that it’ll blow away because, well, that’s what the politicians hope, that we’ll all give up. I think it’s [about] creating a well of public opinion, so that the politicians realise there’s nowhere to go because actually they’re not supported.You’ve got to connect, engage and then do as much as you can. That’s all that can be expected. Once you do that, you’ll find hundreds and thousands of others doing the same, and then eventually politicians go, “Oh, right, there are votes here. We better do the right thing.”It’s moving opinion all the time and keeping the flame alive.Al Jazeera: How would you summarise the ongoing atrocities?Mansfield: I would describe it as a mass assault and destruction of humanity. It doesn’t get worse than that.Al Jazeera: You’ve worked on high-profile cases, such as representing the family of Stephen Lawrence, the Black British teenager stabbed to death in a racist attack, and the Birmingham Six, the group of Irishmen wrongfully arrested for bombings in 1974. What binds the work you’ve done together?Mansfield: It’s the effect and impact on a community. Now the Lawrence case, as it turned out and as it was at the time, had a huge impact on a community. It represented a much bigger issue than, you know, the stabbing of Stephen Lawrence, which was horrific.Although it wasn’t on your TV screens like Gaza and you didn’t see destruction of the kind you see in Gaza, it had a similar effect on people.And there have been other cases like that. It’s not about whether it’s just one individual or thousands. It’s about the impact on the principle of fairness.Note: This interview was edited for clarity and brevity.","Top UK barrister: Israel is carrying out ‘destruction of humanity’ in Gaza","2025-07-15T17:46:59.028477Z"

In this letter, they claimed “Harvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment.”This was followed by a list of demands for the university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to fulfil. Key among them were:Harvard was given a deadline of August to implement these changes. This is the second letter issued by the Trump administration to Harvard. The first one was issued on April 3 and called on Harvard to ban face masks and reform academic departments that it alleged were guilty of anti-Semitic bias. Charges of anti-Semitism have been levelled against numerous US universities and colleges since widespread campus protests were held against the war in Gaza.Harvard’s lawyers responded to the Trump administration by saying the university rejected the demands, arguing they violated its First Amendment rights and freedoms recognised by the US Supreme Court. The US Constitution’s First Amendment upholds the rights to free speech, expression and assembly.The university said Harvard strongly opposes anti-Semitism and continues to make structural changes to ensure that the institution is a welcoming and supportive learning environment for all students.The university also published a separate letter online signed by President Alan Garber on Monday. In the letter, Garber said federal grants have led to research and innovation in fields pertaining to science and medicine. “These innovations have made countless people in our country and throughout the world healthier and safer,” he wrote.The letter then referred to how the government had threatened to pull federal funding from several universities, including Harvard, over allegations of anti-Semitism on campus. The letter said the government retreating from its funding agreements with higher education institutions “risks not only the health and well-being of millions of individuals but also the economic security and vitality of our nation”.The Harvard letter said that while some of the government’s demands are aimed at combating anti-Semitism, “the majority represent direct governmental regulation of the ‘intellectual conditions’ at Harvard.”“The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” Garber added.The Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors filed a lawsuit on Friday in a federal court in Boston, accusing the Trump administration of “unlawful and unprecedented misuse of federal funding and civil rights enforcement authority to undermine academic freedom and free speech on a university campus”.In his latest online post, Trump wrote, “perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?’ Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!”In January 2024, Garber had set up presidential task forces on campus to combat anti-Semitism and fight bias against Muslims and Arabs as Israel’s war on Gaza raged, igniting tensions on campuses around the world, including in the US.In April 2024, pro-Palestine protesters set up an encampment on the Harvard campus, called Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine (HOOP). The protesters demanded that Harvard divest from weapons companies and companies associated with Israel.At that time, Garber said HOOP had disrupted educational activities on campus. In May, the university and protesters said they had reached an agreement to end the encampment, but the two parties gave different accounts about the terms of this agreement.While the student protesters said Harvard had agreed to their demands, the university said it had only opened itself to dialogue on the demands. For example, pertaining to the students’ demand for the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel, Harvard said it had agreed to be more transparent with its students about how its endowment works.On Monday, hours after Harvard’s response, a task force created by the US Department of Education to tackle anti-Semitism released a statement announcing that  $2.3bn in federal funding to the university had been frozen.“Harvard’s statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation’s most prestigious universities and colleges – that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws,” the statement said. The frozen federal funds to Harvard include $2.2bn in grants and $60m in contracts, the statement added.However, more money is at stake – about $9bn. On March 31, the Education Department, Department of Health and Human Services and the General Services Administration released a statement warning they would review $255.6m in contracts between the federal government and Harvard and its affiliates. The statement added that they would also review more than $8.7bn in multiyear grant commitments to Harvard and its affiliates.Harvard’s endowment amounted to $53.2bn in the 2024 fiscal year — the largest of any university. However, donors decide which programmes, departments and purposes 70 percent of the annual endowment distribution is spent on. Endowment donations also dropped by $151m in 2024 as several billionaire donors stopped funding the institution over its response to concerns over anti-Semitism on campus, the university’s student-run newspaper, the Harvard Crimson, reported in October.While Harvard is the first university to reject the Trump administration’s demands, it is not the first Ivy League school to be targeted.Last year, Columbia University in New York emerged as the epicentre of pro-Palestine campus protests. Protesters occupied a campus building, Hamilton Hall, on April 30. The university called in the New York Police Department to crack down on student protesters.In February, the Trump administration pulled back Columbia’s federal funding, worth $400m, citing the institution’s “failure to protect Jewish students from anti-Semitic harassment”. In March, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a recent Columbia graduate and protest leader who had negotiated with the university during the campus demonstrations. Days earlier, the US Department of State revoked the visa of Ranjani Srinivasan, who was an urban planning doctoral candidate at Columbia. Soon after, Columbia unenrolled Srinivasan, who flew to Canada before she could be deported.On March 13, the government’s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism issued a letter to Columbia with nine demands for negotiations to restore the funding that was pulled. On March 18, Columbia accepted the government’s demands, listed in a new memo. The memo said protesting students will have to present university identification if prompted. It added that face masks would be banned if they are being used to conceal a person’s identity. However, face coverings are still allowed for religious or medical reasons. The memo also added that Columbia had hired 36 security officers who have special powers to arrest students, and the university continues to rely on New York police for additional security assistance.Over the past few weeks, the Trump administration has suspended or frozen funding for Princeton, Cornell and Northwestern universities. The universities have responded by expressing frustration and highlighting how federal funding is important for critical research.On April 11, the US Department of Energy, which funds research at many universities, announced a universal cap on the indirect costs it would finance for projects it supports. The agency said this would save the government $405m a year.Nine universities and three bodies representing higher education institutions have since filed a lawsuit challenging that cap. The plaintiffs in the case include the Association of American Universities, American Council on Education, Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities, Brown University, California Institute of Technology, Cornell University, Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the regents of the University of Michigan, Board of Trustees of Michigan State University, the trustees of Princeton University and the University of Rochester.Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders congratulated Harvard on X on Monday “for refusing to relinquish its constitutional rights to Trump’s authoritarianism”.Former US President Barack Obama posted on Tuesday: “Harvard has set an example for other higher-ed institutions – rejecting an unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom.”Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey posted a statement on X congratulating Harvard for “standing against the Trump Administration’s brazen attempt to bully schools and weaponize the US Department of Justice under the false pretext of civil rights”.","Harvard’s $2.3bn gamble: What Trump demanded; how the university resisted","2025-07-14T21:34:54.871834Z"

This type of research is now in jeopardy,” a Northwestern spokesperson told Reuters.Last month, the Trump administration sent a letter to 60 universities, including Cornell and Northwestern, that it could bring enforcement actions if a review determined the schools had failed to stop what it called anti-Semitism.Columbia University, the epicentre of last year’s pro-Palestinian campus protests, had its $400m funding cancelled last month.Later, the university agreed to some significant changes that Trump’s administration demanded for talks about restoring the funding. Its decision to bow to those demands, in part to salvage continuing research projects at its labs and medical centre, has been criticised by some faculty and free speech groups as capitulating to an intrusion on academic freedom.Last week, the US government also announced a review of $9bn in federal grants and contracts to Harvard University and has since listed conditions it must meet to receive federal money. Princeton University also said last week that the government froze dozens of research grants.US federal agents have also detained some foreign student protesters in recent weeks from different campuses and are working to deport them. And the government has revoked the visas of many foreign students.Rights advocates have raised concerns about Islamophobia and anti-Arab bias during Israel’s war on Gaza.The Trump administration has not announced steps in response.","US freezes funds for Cornell, Northwestern after pro-Palestinian protests","2025-06-28T09:54:48.583629Z"

They issued orders to close the schools within 30 days.“If we are forced to close, the consequences will be dire as the children will be deprived of their basic right to education, which will exacerbate their suffering and negatively affect their future,” said Abir Ismail, director of UNRWA’s information office.UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement that Israel’s orders were a “violation” of international law and the rules granting the UN operations protection from local jurisdictions.“Some 800 boys and girls are directly impacted by these closure orders and are likely to miss finishing their school year,” Lazzarini wrote.Al Jazeera correspondent Nour Odeh said the closure of the UNRWA schools is “extremely problematic” because the children would likely end up at Israeli institutions run by the Jerusalem Municipality.She explained that the children admitted to Israeli schools would no longer be taught under the Palestinian curriculum.“It is an Israeli-run curriculum that Palestinians say ignores and erases Palestinian identity,” Odeh said from Jordan’s capital, Amman. Al Jazeera is reporting from Jordan because it has been banned from Israel and the West Bank.UNRWA currently provides humanitarian assistance to about 750,000 Palestinians.Ismail said the aid agency maintained its “firm commitment to continue providing educational services to Palestine refugees in East Jerusalem, including the current academic year”.However, Israel has accused UNRWA employees of involvement in the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, a charge vehemently denied by the UN.Last year, in the aftermath of those allegations, the Israeli Knesset passed two bills prohibiting UNRWA from conducting activities within Israel’s borders and making it illegal for Israeli officials to have any contact with UNRWA. Those measures have been in effect since January.Odeh said Israel started implementing its ban by refusing to engage with UNRWA on the subject of aid to Gaza. But now, she explained, the country has moved on to targeting the agency’s operations and headquarters in occupied East Jerusalem.That move, she said, is likely to have a “crippling effect” on UNRWA’s operations “in 19 other refugee camps” across the occupied West Bank, affecting “Palestinians who rely on the agency, not just for education but also for health services, for psychosocial support”.Odeh added that Israel has accelerated its implementation of the UNRWA ban since the start of its “Iron Wall” military incursion in the West Bank in January.The operation was launched just two days after a ceasefire took effect in Gaza.It has involved the Israeli military bombing and bulldozing communities across the West Bank, razing entire residential areas in what critics fear is a bid to move towards full annexation.More than 40,000 Palestinians have been uprooted from the Jenin and Tulkarem refugee camps as part of the military campaign.UNRWA was established by the UN General Assembly in 1949 to provide assistance to Palestinians displaced from their land during the creation of Israel in 1948, an event known to Palestinians as the Nakba, or “catastrophe”.","Israel shuts down UNRWA-affiliated schools in occupied East Jerusalem","2025-07-14T21:44:35.248994Z"

No food. No fuel. No medicine. No commercial supplies,” Guterres said in New York.“As aid has dried up, the floodgates of horror have reopened. Gaza is a killing field – and civilians are in an endless death loop,” he added.COGAT, an Israeli military unit responsible for civilian matters in occupied Palestinian territory, last week met with UN agencies and international aid groups and said it proposed “a structured monitoring and aid entry mechanism” for Gaza, after it claimed that aid was being diverted away from civilians by Hamas.Jonathan Whittall, the senior UN aid official for Gaza and the West Bank, said last week that there was no evidence of aid being diverted.Israel last month resumed its bombardment of Gaza, ending a fragile two-month truce. It also sent troops back into the enclave and has been trying to seize territory, including parts of Rafah in Gaza’s south.“Meanwhile, at the crossing points, food, medicine and shelter supplies are piling up, and vital equipment is stuck,” Guterres said.Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo, reporting from UN headquarters in New York, said it is the first time Guterres has used such strong language in remarks about Gaza, signalling that he is getting “exasperated by how bad the situation has become there”.“He laid out very specific ways in which Israel is violating international law.”Guterres concluded his remarks by once again calling for a permanent ceasefire, full humanitarian access in Gaza and the release of Israeli captives held in Gaza.“With crossing points into Gaza shut and aid blockaded, security is in shambles and our capacity to deliver has been strangled,” he said.“As the occupying power, Israel has unequivocal obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law,” Guterres said.That means Israel should facilitate relief programmes and ensure food, medical care, hygiene and public health standards in Gaza, he said. “None of that is happening today,” he added.Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron visited the Egyptian city of El Arish, a key transit point for Gaza-bound aid, to call on Israel to lift its blockade of aid deliveries.Alongside his Egyptian host, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Macron toured a hospital in the port city 50km (30 miles) west of the Gaza Strip and met with medical professionals and sick and wounded Palestinians evacuated from Gaza.Carrying a bouquet of red roses to give to patients, the French president visited several wards as well as a play area for children.His office said the trip was aimed at putting pressure on Israel for “the reopening of crossing points for the delivery of humanitarian goods into Gaza”.Emergency department doctor Mahmud Mohammad Elshaer said the hospital had treated about 1,200 Palestinian patients since Israel’s assault on Gaza began in October 2023.“Some days we can receive 100 patients, others 50,” Elshaer said, adding that many had sustained amputations or eye or brain injuries.In Cairo, Macron, el-Sisi and Jordan’s King Abdullah II called for an “immediate return” to the ceasefire.The three leaders met on Monday to discuss the war and humanitarian efforts to alleviate the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza, the vast majority of whom have been displaced at least once during the war.More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s genocide in Gaza.

The detour added roughly 400 km (250 miles) to his journey.Last November, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and his former defence minister for alleged war crimes against Palestinians in Gaza.The ICC is an independent court based in The Hague, Netherlands, that prosecutes individuals accused of committing serious international crimes like genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression.It is the first court with the authority to hold individuals criminally accountable for these crimes, rather than states or organisations, with member states required to arrest those subject to ICC warrants.The ICC was established in 2002 following the adoption of the Rome Statute in 1998.The Rome Statute is the treaty that outlines the rules for how the ICC operates.Adopted in 1998 during a diplomatic conference in Rome, Italy, it was where nations worldwide came together to create a justice system for addressing the most serious crimes against humanity.As of April 2025, 137 countries had signed the Rome Statute – indicating their intention to join – while 125 of them had formally ratified it, becoming full member states of the ICC.The countries that have signed or ratified the Rome Statute are shown on the map below.Fiji, Ghana, Italy, San Marino, Senegal, Trinidad and TobagoAustria, Belgium, Botswana, Canada, France, Gabon, Germany, Iceland, Lesotho, Luxembourg, Mali, Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Norway, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Spain, Tajikistan, VenezuelaAndorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Central African Republic, Costa Rica, Croatia, Denmark, Dominica, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Netherlands, Nigeria, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, United KingdomBarbados, Benin, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Ecuador, Estonia, Gambia, Greece, Honduras, Ireland, Jordan, Latvia, Malawi, Malta, Mauritius, Mongolia, Namibia, Niger, North Macedonia, Panama, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Slovakia, Slovenia, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Uganda, Uruguay, ZambiaAfghanistan, Albania, Georgia, Guinea, LithuaniaBurkina Faso, Guyana, Liberia, Republic of the CongoDominican Republic, Kenya, MexicoComoros, Montenegro, Saint Kitts and NevisChad, JapanCook Islands, Madagascar, SurinameChile, Czech RepublicBangladesh, Moldova, Saint Lucia, SeychellesCape Verde, Grenada, Maldives, TunisiaGuatemala, VanuatuIvory CoastPalestineEl SalvadorKiribatiArmeniaUkraineSo far, only Burundi (2017) and the Philippines (2019) have withdrawn from the court, while Hungary — which hosted Netanyahu last week — announced on the eve of his arrival that it was withdrawing from the ICC.A state’s withdrawal from the court becomes effective one year after it formally submits a notice of withdrawal – usually in the form of a letter – to the office of the United Nations secretary-general.Member states of the ICC are required to fully cooperate with the court in its investigations and prosecutions. This includes arresting suspects, providing evidence and witness testimony, and offering protection to victims and witnesses. They should also enforce the decisions of the court, which includes executing arrest warrants and enforcing sentences.States are also encouraged to incorporate crimes defined by the ICC, such as genocide and war crimes, into their national laws, ensuring their legal systems are capable of addressing these offences.In effect, all of this means that a country that is part of the ICC is expected to take into custody those who face arrest warrants from the court, if those individuals — such as Netanyahu in Hungary — are on their territory.However, ICC members states have not always followed this in practice. In 2017, South Africa, a member of the court, did not arrest Sudan’s then leader Omar al-Bashir, who was visiting, despite an ICC warrant against him.On November 21, 2024, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and a Hamas commander, Mohammed Deif, over alleged war crimes.There are “reasonable grounds” to believe that Gallant and Netanyahu “intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity”, the ICC said.Israel rejected the charges as false and politically motivated.The Biden administration rejected the arrest warrant, calling it “outrageous”, while the Trump administration later imposed sanctions on ICC officials.The United States is not a member of the ICC.In 2000, during the Clinton presidency, the US did sign the Rome Statute, but it was never ratified by the Senate. In 2002, under the administration of President George W Bush, the US withdrew its signature.On February 6, 2025, US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the ICC, accusing the court of targeting both Israel and the US.Trump’s executive order claimed that the ICC had “abused its power” by issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, asserting that the court had taken “illegitimate” actions against the US and its “close ally” Israel.On Thursday, Hungary announced its decision to withdraw from the International Criminal Court, just before Prime Minister Viktor Orban received his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu.Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp of the Netherlands, which hosts the ICC, said on Thursday that until Hungary’s withdrawal from the ICC was complete, which he said takes about a year, the country must still meet its duties.European Union countries have been split on the ICC warrant.Some said last year they would meet their ICC commitments, while Italy has said there were legal doubts, and France has said it believed Netanyahu had immunity from ICC actions.Germany’s next chancellor Friedrich Merz said in February he would find a way for Netanyahu to visit without being arrested.The ICC has 12 ongoing investigations including from Afghanistan, Bangladesh/Myanmar, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ivory Coast, Libya, Mali, Palestine, Philippines, Sudan, Venezuela and Ukraine.There have been 32 cases before the court, with some having more than one suspect. ICC judges have issued at least 60 arrest warrants.ICC judges have issued 11 convictions and four acquittals. Twenty-one people have been held in the ICC detention centre in The Hague and have appeared before the court, and 31 people remain at large. Charges have been dropped against seven people due to their deaths.Of the 11 convictions, only six have been for the court’s core crimes of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The others were for crimes such as witness tampering. The six convicted men were all African fighter group leaders from the DRC, Mali and Uganda. Terms ranged from nine to 30 years in prison. The maximum possible term is life imprisonment.The International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) are just less than 3km (1.9 miles) apart in The Hague, a city in the Netherlands.Both courts are currently looking at cases related to Israel and Palestine, yet despite their similar abbreviations, there are some key differences between the two.Notably, the ICJ’s responsibilities include settling legal disputes between states while the ICC prosecutes individuals for war crimes.","Which countries are International Criminal Court members?","2025-06-28T10:47:46.718902Z"

If they can get away with taking more territory, then they will take more territory,” he said.Israel reportedly wants to thwart Turkish influence in Syria, sources involved in United States-Israeli discussions on the subject told the Reuters news agency in February.Reuters reported that Israel was lobbying US officials that, for Israel’s benefit, Russia should keep its bases in Syria.According to sources who spoke to Reuters, US officials were surprised that Israel would pitch the continued presence of Russia, rather than turn to the US’s NATO ally Turkiye to provide stability in the region.Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar has made accusations against Ankara of being a “negative” influence.“They are doing their utmost to have Syria as a Turkish protectorate. It’s clear that is their intention,” he told a news conference in Paris on Thursday.On Thursday, Turkiye’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Israel must withdraw from Syria.“To establish security throughout the region, Israel must first abandon its expansionist policies, withdraw from the territories it occupies, and stop undermining efforts to establish stability in Syria,” the ministry said.Turkiye played a key role in supporting Syria’s opposition during the war against al-Assad and his forces and has maintained strong relations with the transitional government now in Damascus.Very little, since Syria is physically and economically in ruins due to 14 years of civil war, Kassab said.Al-Sharaa also has few people he can ask for help other than Turkiye, he noted.“It is not the government [fighters] that are fighting Israel. It is local people in Syrian towns trying to defend themselves,” Kassab told Al Jazeera.He added that locals in Homs and Hama had mobilised to try and push back Israel.However, he said, Israeli media was calling these fighters “members of HTS”, using the same terminology that the Israeli government was using to justify attacks in southern Syria.“It’s appalling that the so-called international community is not doing anything to stop Israel,” Kassab added.","Why is Israel attacking Syria?","2025-07-15T19:38:58.112033Z"

Arab nations have decried the plan, and rights groups have called it ethnic cleansing. Protesters also condemned US crackdowns on pro-Palestinian activism on university campuses.Many Moroccans view Trump’s stance as a continuation of policies under his predecessor, former US President Joe Biden.“[Trump] has made the war worse,” said Mohammed Toussi, who travelled from Casablanca with his family to join the protest, speaking to the Associated Press news agency.“Biden hid some things, but Trump has shown it all,” he added, arguing that their policies differ in tone but not in substance.Abdelhak El Arabi, an adviser to Morocco’s former conservative prime minister, said public outrage had only grown as the war dragged on.“It’s not a war — Gaza is being wiped off the map,” said the 62-year-old resident of Tamesna, speaking to AP.A broad coalition of groups joined the protests. While Moroccan authorities tolerate most demonstrations, they have arrested activists accused of targeting foreign embassies or linking their criticism to the monarchy.Many demonstrators remain angered by Morocco’s 2020 decision to normalise ties with Israel, a move that sparked controversy at the time and continues to fuel discontent.Morocco signed the Abraham Accords, a foreign policy push from the first Trump administration, that saw the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Sudan normalise relations with Israel in return for various diplomatic and financial agreements.Nevertheless, public feeling towards Israel has rarely been conciliatory in Morocco, as in many Arab states.","Mass protests in Morocco against Israel’s war in Gaza and US support","2025-06-28T10:44:42.494893Z"

Fifty-thousand people have died and Microsoft powers this genocide in our region.”“Thank you for your protest, I hear you,” Suleyman said.Aboussad continued, shouting that Suleyman and “all of Microsoft” had blood on their hands. She also threw onto the stage a keffiyeh scarf, which has become a symbol of support for Palestinian people, before being escorted out of the event.An investigation by The Associated Press news agency revealed earlier this year that AI models from Microsoft and OpenAI were used as part of an Israeli military programme to select bombing targets during its wars in Gaza and Lebanon.A second protester, Microsoft employee Vaniya Agrawal, interrupted another part of the celebration during which Gates, Ballmer and current CEO Satya Nadella were on stage – the first public gathering since 2014 of the three men who have been Microsoft’s CEO.In February, five Microsoft employees were ejected from a meeting with Nadella for protesting against the contracts.While the February event was an internal meeting, Friday’s protest was far more public – a livestreamed showcase of the company’s past and future. Some employees also rallied outside the event on Friday.“We provide many avenues for all voices to be heard,” said a statement from the company.“Importantly, we ask that this be done in a way that does not cause a business disruption.

I’m heading west of Gaza City, looking for any street where I can set up a tent.”“We are being forced to leave and we don’t even know where to go,” added Mahmoud al-Gharabli, another displaced Palestinian. “We are exhausted and completely broken.”The military push follows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s threat to intensify the offensive to pressure Hamas into further concessions.“We are now dividing the Strip and we are increasing pressure step by step so they will give us our hostages,” Netanyahu said in a video message on Wednesday.On Friday, Israeli forces continued devastating aerial attacks, killing at least 38 people, medical sources told Al Jazeera. This followed an intense day of bombardment on Thursday that left 112 dead – many of them women and children.Conditions inside Gaza City’s al-Ahli Hospital, also known as the Baptist Hospital, where many victims in the north were taken, are “nothing short of apocalyptic,” Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said after visiting the facility.“We are seeing bodies laid on the ground and they are counted in the 10s,” Mahmoud said. “We’ve seen doctors, they are helpless.

For a moment, he could not breathe.When he lifted his head, the al-Zeini home was gone.“Just like that, the house had collapsed into a smouldering heap of rubble and twisted metal,” the 30-year-old civil servant said.“All 12 al-Zeinis – mostly women and kids – who were inside on a peaceful Ramadan evening, were killed,” he said in pain.The al-Zeini family had been killed in a raid ordered by United States President Donald Trump.Trump claimed he wanted to target Houthi fighters and military installations, to force them to stop attacking Israeli-linked ships in the Red Sea – which the Houthis say they are doing in response to Israel’s ongoing blockade of the Gaza Strip.The US raids continued, and have killed at least 53 people, while nearly 100 others were wounded.Mohammed, palms bleeding from the force with which he was hurled onto the asphalt, raced to the house to see if there were any survivors.The house had been demolished, along with the one right next to it.He joined a crowd of neighbours pulling away bricks and iron rebar in search of people, to ultimately realise no one was alive.“I was swept away by emotions and thoughts, just like my surroundings.

I was terrified.“I screamed out their names … nothing,” she said, her voice cracking as she recalled that night.“A neighbour spotted two small bodies flung several metres away by the blast’s force,” Khawla, who asked to be referred to by her first name only, said.The neighbour scooped them into his arms and carried them into Khawla’s home, afraid that another attack might follow, and feeling it would be safer to be indoors.“I chased after him, sobbing and trying to understand how badly my boys were hurt. They were too shocked to respond, but once inside, I frantically examined every inch of their bodies.”Luckily, the boys’ injuries were limited to bruises and cuts all over their bodies, and she was able to tend to them herself.“These are cuts that are curable, but there are scars too deep and much more difficult to fix.

With Hamas refusing the new demands, Israel resumed bombing the Strip and relocated troops inside the enclave.On Sunday, Netanyahu also said Israel would work to implement Trump’s “voluntary emigration plan” for Gaza and said his cabinet had agreed to keep pressuring Hamas, which says it has agreed to a new ceasefire proposal from mediators Egypt and Qatar.Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said that Netanyahu’s comments were a recipe for “endless escalation” in the region.Netanyahu rejected assertions that Israel was not negotiating, saying “We are conducting it under fire, and therefore it is also effective”.“We see that there are suddenly cracks,” he said in a video statement issued on Sunday.Khalil al-Hayya, the Hamas leader in Gaza, said the group had agreed to a proposal that security sources said included the release of five Israeli captives each week.

Her legal team was also informed earlier this month that her permanent residence status in the US had been revoked.Such actions form part of a “larger pattern of attempted US government repression of constitutionally protected activity and other forms of speech”, Chung’s lawsuit states and cites the Trump administration’s attempt to deport other international students in the country.One such case is Mahmoud Khalil, a recent graduate from Columbia University. His attempted deportation over his role in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia is one of the most high-profile among several students targeted by Trump. Held in detention, Khalil has described himself as a political prisoner detained for exercising his free speech.Khalil is also challenging the Trump administration’s efforts to remove him from the country, and on March 10, a New York district court prohibited his deportation and extended it two days later.Another student up for deportation is Cornell University’s Momodou Taal, who is also suing the US government for attempting to deport him.Badar Khan Suri, an Indian student at Georgetown University, faces a similar situation, as he remains detained by the government.

The group says it has branches across the world, including chapters throughout the US.“Our movement has changed the course of the Jewish world. We are the fastest growing Zionist movement worldwide with more than 35 chapters, including throughout Europe, Latin America, Australia and the United States,” Daniel Levy, spokesperson for Betar US, told Al Jazeera by email.“We are loud, proud, aggressive and unapologetically Zionist. We aren’t the nice, polite Jews we are the loud proud Zionists,” the group says on its website.Zionism is a nationalist and political ideology originating in 19th-century Europe that called for the creation of a Jewish state.Betar US works “on campus, in cities, in the media, in business communities and on the streets”, according to its website.But critics have questioned the gulf between the group’s bold advocacy of its views and the limited information about Betar US leaders and members available on its public platforms, including its website.Jenin Younes, a civil liberties and free speech lawyer, said the secrecy was “unusual”.“They claim to be loud and proud,” she said, “but their website does not say who their employees are. That is somewhat unusual for a nonprofit that has received tax-exempt status from the state of New York.”“It suggests that they are trying to shield themselves from accountability,” Younes said.Betar US, however, rejected suggestions that it had anything to hide. “Betar in the US is a 501c3 non-profit and in full compliance with all rules and regulations and filings,” Levy told Al Jazeera.Since the campus protests erupted last year, Betar US has doxxed pro-Palestinian students. “We’ve provided his name to the government! And many more,” Betar posted on X in January, referring to Khalil.In the same X thread, the group posted a video with Khalil giving an interview, and accused him of saying “Zionists don’t deserve to live while he’s on a visa”. But in the clip shared by Betar US, Khalil does not say that.Two days after Khalil was arrested, Betar US posted a message on X in which they openly declared their intent to have pro-Palestinian students expelled. In the widely shared post, the group said: “We told you we have been working on deportations and will continue to do so. Expect naturalised citizens to start being picked up within the month.”In the statement to Al Jazeera, Betar’s Levy confirmed that “we provided hundreds of names to the Trump Administration of visa holders, and naturalized Middle Easterners and foreigners”, who he claimed — without offering evidence — “support US designated terrorist organizations”.“Those who come to the United States on visas or as naturalized citizens and encourage hate and violence will be deported,” Levy said.The group also insists that those it is targeting in its lists are anti-Semitic. However, many civil rights organisations have in recent months raised concerns that pro-Israel groups and their supporters are conflating criticism of Israel and Zionism with anti-Semitism, which they say hampers free speech in the US and other countries.“Betar US is acting as a nonprofit organisation here in the US,” Abed Ayoub, executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), told Al Jazeera. “But they are engaged in aggressive forms of harassment, going after First Amendment rights [which grants free speech].”Ayoub called Betar US “a problematic entity that is causing a lot of concern”.The group has openly called for a bloodbath in the besieged and bombarded Gaza Strip, where Israel has resumed its devastating war. In a now-deleted post, Betar US responded to a list of names including hundreds of Palestinian babies killed in the enclave, saying: “Not enough. We demand blood in Gaza!”On Tuesday, Israel launched a predawn strike in Gaza after a breakdown in talks for the second stage of the ceasefire, killing more than 400 people, including 174 children and women. Israel has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians since October 7, 2023. The brutal Israeli response came after Hamas carried out an attack in Israel, killing 1,139 people and taking some 250 captive, dozens of whom remain in Gaza.Betar’s social media accounts have repeatedly posted messages calling for violence and the expulsion of Palestinians from their land. In one post, the group said it “firmly supports the plan to remove Palestinians from Gaza”.Younes, the civil liberties lawyer, recalled how in January, Betar US said in a post on X that they were going to disrupt a vigil for Hind Rajab, a six-year-old girl who was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza last year.Betar US has been labelled an “extremist group” by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Jewish advocacy group set up more than a century ago to combat anti-Semitism.However, Levy said in his statement to Al Jazeera that the group was a “mainstream” Zionist organisation and represents “the majority of the Zionist and Israeli public”.Levy dismissed ADL’s labelling of Betar as “extremist”. The ADL, he said, was a “radical, left-wing, woke” organisation. “Anyone calling Betar extremists is calling Zionism extremism,” he said.Totally, it says.“Those who come to the United States on visas or as naturalized citizens don’t have the right to come participate in Hamas events or support terrorist organisations,” Levy said. “We support the Trump Administration’s policy.”However, Trump administration officials are yet to make public any evidence linking those who have been detained — including Khalil — to any support for Hamas or other organisations listed as “terrorist” groups in the US.Khalil, who has been lodged in a detention facility in Louisiana, said on Tuesday he was a “political prisoner” in his first comments since his arrest by Department of Homeland Security officers on March 8. “My arrest was a direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza, which resumed in full force Monday night,” he wrote.On March 7, before his arrest, Khalil had written an email to Katrina Armstrong, the interim president of Columbia University, asking her to “protect international students from doxing and from deportation”, citing threats by Betar.Younes, the free speech lawyer, said the arrest “speaks to the sheer insanity and terror of the current moment”, especially if “the president of the United States” was taking Betar’s advice about whom to deport – something that has not yet been confirmed.Betar, meanwhile, wants the Trump administration to do even more.“While we thank the Trump Administration, we urge many more deportations and quicker,” Levy, the Betar spokesperson said.Yes, but to different extents.The legality of Trump’s deportation threats remains highly contentious.According to Ayoub from the ADC, Trump’s deportation orders are technically legally enforceable. The administration has the authority to revoke the visas of foreign students under certain conditions – namely if a person is engaging in fraud, or has been deemed a national security threat, say experts.However, Younes argued that the First Amendment of the US Constitution “does not differentiate application based upon immigration status”, and that these deportations are “unlawful”.Khalil’s lawyers have approached the courts to have his deportation blocked.More broadly, civil rights groups are alarmed over what they perceive as a crackdown on free speech, which is protected under the First Amendment.Ayoub said universities have a responsibility to protect students.“Universities have to stand by the right of all students to exercise their First Amendment rights to freedom of expression. They can’t engage in vilifying students or spreading information about them,” Ayoub said.He warned that this situation creates a “chilling effect” where students are too afraid to speak up, affecting not just Palestinian activists, but all other activists.Osama Abuirshaid, executive director of American Muslims for Palestine, echoed similar concerns, saying universities have “completely capitulated to pressure from big donors and the Trump administration”.“These are some of the most difficult times to be a student of conscience and global citizen,” he told Al Jazeera.Younes, the free speech lawyer, said with Trump’s executive orders in effect and groups like Betar US targeting students, foreign nationals, especially, should seek legal counsel immediately before engaging in pro-Palestine activity.“Unfortunately, the safest thing to do is to remain silent now,” she said.","What is Betar US, the group pushing to deport pro-Palestinian students?","2025-07-15T19:40:55.518757Z"

Chung will have an opportunity to present her case before an immigration judge,” the spokesperson said.Immigration agents have not been able to detain Chung despite visiting her parents’ residences multiple times, according to reports.Chung, who migrated to the US from South Korea with her parents when she was seven years old, is seeking a court order to block the Trump administration’s efforts to deport non-citizens who participated in campus protests against Israel’s war on Gaza. She is also asking a judge to prevent the administration from detaining her, moving her out of New York City or removing her from the country while her lawsuit plays out.“ICE’s shocking actions against Ms Chung form part of a larger pattern of attempted US government repression of constitutionally protected protest activity and other forms of speech,” said Chung’s lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan.If successful, Chung’s lawsuit could block the administration’s efforts to deport non-US citizens who took part in campus protests against Israel. Chung’s lawsuit also cites the Trump administration’s efforts to deport five other students who have spoken out on pro-Palestinian issues.In one of the most high-profile cases, immigration officials detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate student, and told him his green card was being revoked because he participated in protests.Khalil, who received a master’s degree last semester, served as a negotiator for students as they bargained with Columbia officials over an end to their campus tent encampment last spring.Also due for deportation is Momodou Taal, of Cornell University, who received a notice last week to surrender to immigration authorities after he sued on March 15 to preempt deportation efforts.Taal’s lawyer, Eric Lee, said Monday that his client is not being required to surrender before a hearing in the lawsuit scheduled for Tuesday in Syracuse.The government has also detained Badar Khan Suri, an Indian studying at Georgetown University – though a federal judge has barred Suri’s deportation – as well as refusing to let a professor at Brown University’s medical school enter the US.Chung’s petition comes after President Trump promised to deport foreign pro-Palestinian protesters, whom he has accused of being “pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American”, a charge dismissed by the protests and rights advocates who say the president’s order violates the free speech rights of international students and scholars.","Korean American sues Trump admin to stop deportation over campus activism","2025-06-28T10:40:12.103994Z"

However, as the truce fell apart, the Yemeni group threatened to resume its campaign.National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on Sunday that the Houthi threat is forcing 75 percent of US-flagged shipping to take the far-longer route around the southern coast of Africa rather than going through the Suez Canal.The Houthis have also claimed attacks targeting Israel in recent days. The Israeli military claimed on Sunday to have successfully intercepted a ballistic missile fired by the group.US air raids have killed at least 79 people and injured more than 100 in Yemen since last Thursday, according to the Houthis.The US has offered few specifics on the sites it is striking during its campaign, and has not yet confirmed any air raids on Sanaa.A defence official told the AFP news agency: “CENTCOM [US Central Command] is conducting strikes across multiple locations of Iran-backed Houthi locations every day and night in Yemen.”Waltz said the recent US attacks have “taken out key Houthi leadership”, including the head of their missile programme.“We’ve hit their headquarters,” Waltz said. “We’ve hit communications nodes, weapons factories and even some of their over-the-water drone production facilities.”The Houthis have dismissed the US claims that it is targeting military sites in Yemen as a “complete lie and slander”.The Houthi government in Yemen said: “The pictures, scenes, evidence, types of victims, and testimonies of survivors from the targeted sites confirm that it is targeting residential neighbourhoods and innocent civilians, and provide conclusive evidence that the US is deliberately taking the lives of defenceless civilians and destroying the capabilities of our people.”The Houthis also said the latest US attacks will not deter them from supporting Palestinians in Gaza and that the country will also support Lebanon and Hezbollah, if necessary.","US fires on Sanaa as campaign against Yemen’s Houthis continues","2025-06-24T20:03:59.088890Z"

An estimated 1,139 people were killed and some 250 were taken captive in the attack in southern Israel.The death toll is expected to rise as Israeli forces struck the surgical building inside Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis late on Sunday, causing a large fire to break out, the health ministry said.The Israeli army and intelligence agency Shin Bet in a statement confirmed the attack, claiming their forces targeted “a key” Hamas member at the hospital, one of the largest health facilities in Gaza.Earlier, medical sources told Al Jazeera that at least 46 Palestinians were killed by Israeli attacks Sunday, mostly in the southern Gaza cities of Khan Younis and Rafah.Israel reignited its war on Gaza after its refusal to enter the second phase of a ceasefire deal it had signed with Hamas in January.Entering phase 2 would have required Israel to withdraw its forces from Gaza – a condition it agreed to in the deal mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the United States. Even during phase 1, which took effect on January 19 and saw the release of captives in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails, Israel killed more than 150 Palestinians in Gaza.Reporting from Gaza City in northern Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said the announced death toll is a “very grim, horrifying milestone”.“For the record, the 50,000 figure is only a conservative estimate. These are only the people who have been registered at health facilities across the Gaza Strip. There are so many others buried without being registered or who have gone missing, trapped under piles of rubble,” Mahmoud said.“Of the more than 50,000 killed, 17,000 are children. A whole generation has been wiped out. These children would have affected how their society would have progressed – politically, economically and intellectually,” he added.The confirmed death toll does not include more than 11,000 who are missing and are presumed dead, according to the Gaza media office, while a study  published last July in the Lancet journal said the accumulative effects of Israel’s war on Gaza could mean the true death toll could reach more than 186,000 people.Israel has repeatedly claimed that its attacks carefully target members of Hamas, but the number of civilians killed tells a different story, analysts say.“Israel has been making these types of baseless claims throughout the past 17 months, which are totally unsupported by the evidence on the ground,” Omar Rahman, a fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, told Al Jazeera.“If anything, the evidence often points to deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, which accounts for the massive death toll for children.”Meanwhile, the Israeli military on Sunday called on residents in the southern Gaza city of Rafah to forcibly evacuate as its troops began operations in the area.It said Israeli troops had surrounded Rafah’s Tal as-Sultan neighbourhood.Israel has been accused of repeatedly targeting so-called “safe zones” where it forced people to take shelter.The Israeli military also announced that it was conducting operations in Beit Hanoon in northern Gaza.Last week, Israel resumed its attacks, shattering the ceasefire after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he would pursue a military path to pressure Hamas into accepting a deal to release remaining captives, who were not exchanged in the January ceasefire agreement.Hamas reiterates it is ready to release all the captives if Israel agrees to enter phase 2 of the earlier truce deal.Since Tuesday, Israel has killed more than 600 people, including more than 200 children.Earlier, Hamas announced that its official Salah al-Bardawil was killed in an Israeli attack on his tent in Khan Younis in the early hours of Sunday.The Israeli military offensive comes as Gaza is reeling from a total blockade by Israel since early March that has caused a severe shortage of food, water, medicine and fuel in the territory. Rights group Amnesty International said cutting off electricity supply to a desalination plant in Gaza was “cruel and unlawful”.Rights groups, aid agencies and a number countries including France, Germany and the United Kingdom have called on Israel to allow humanitarian assistance to enter Gaza.","Israel’s war on Gaza has killed 50,000 Palestinians since October 2023","2025-07-14T21:37:57.037540Z"

Some see the Houthis as an Iranian proxy, while others view the Houthis as a group friendly to Iran, but independent.According to his public comments, US President Donald Trump falls in the first camp.Washington will view “every shot” fired by the Houthis as a shot fired by Iran that could bring about “dire consequences”, he said.Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, however, said on Friday that his country has no need for proxies and that the Houthis act in their own interests.Do Iran and the Houthis operate hand in hand? Or is it more nuanced than that? Let’s take a closer look:Officially known as Ansar Allah (supporters of God), the Houthis are a political and military movement that emerged in the 1990s but rose to international prominence in 2014 when they took control of the Yemeni capital, Sanaa.After months of fighting with the Yemeni government and other forces, a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia with support from the US and the United Arab Emirates, among others, intervened militarily against the Houthis.But the group is still in control of Sanaa and, if anything, has grown stronger over the past decade.Since the beginning of Israel’s war on Gaza, the Houthis have been attacking Israel-linked ships heading through the Red Sea, and launching direct missile and drone attacks on Israel to pressure it to end its war on the besieged enclave.Tehran has publicly backed the Yemeni armed group for years but denies directly providing it with advanced weaponry that has been used in combat in the past few years.The Houthis say they manufacture weapons domestically, and point out that – as the de facto state in Sanaa and Yemen’s heavily populated northwest – they have taken over weapons stockpiles left behind by the government when it fled south.The group has tried to diversify its arms manufacturing industry, making more weapons domestically while still partly relying on imported parts.Israel said the Houthi projectile that crashed in its territory in July 2024, killing one person and injuring several others, was an Iranian-design suicide drone.Houthi authorities said they planned and executed the strike themselves, and Iran was not in the loop.A United Nations panel of experts also said last year that the Houthis received training from Iran and the Lebanese group Hezbollah and that the Houthis do “not have the capacity to develop and produce, without foreign support, complex weapons systems”.Western countries, however, maintain that Iran has transferred weapons and technologies for ballistic missiles, antiship cruise missiles, and a variety of drones. They also claim that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has trained Houthi soldiers and advises them militarily.The US has alleged the Houthis have also tried to buy weapons and parts through companies in China while working to get antiship cruise missiles from Russia amid the fallout of Moscow’s war in Ukraine.Iranian diplomats frequently host Houthi officials, and Iranian state media hails the group as an important member of the Tehran-led axis of resistance.The two sides were in constant contact during Yemen’s civil war, with Iran condemning coalition attacks on Yemen amid what was described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.The Houthis increased their attacks on the coalition in the aftermath of the 2020 US assassination of Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top general and a main architect of the axis.The Houthis have been known to adopt similar geopolitical rhetoric to Iran, support the principles of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, and the Iranian political system has greatly influenced them.However, the Houthis differ from the Iranian establishment in many ways.The Houthis largely follow the Zaidi school of Shia Islam, which has similarities to but differs from, the Twelver Shia Islam practised in Iran.The Zaidi tradition has been in Yemen for more than 1,000 years – and the Houthis see themselves as part of that legacy, and having grown organically as a local movement, rather than a foreign project.The group has also set out independent political and military objectives, such as gaining control over a unified Yemen and fighting foreign intervention, especially by the US and Israel.The Houthis have demonstrated a willingness to attack Saudi Arabia and the UAE based on Yemeni grievances, particularly those involving air strikes and blockades that devastated the local population.At times, they have ignored Iranian advice, including when they unilaterally declared a ceasefire and held talks with Saudi Arabia in 2019 when Tehran was believed to be in favour of military resistance.Washington has signalled it intends to bomb Yemen in the coming weeks, or even months.The dozens of air strikes across the country to date have killed children and women, along with Houthi fighters.The attacks came after the Houthis threatened to resume their strikes – that had halted after the January 19 ceasefire in Gaza – in opposition to Israel’s blocking of all humanitarian aid from entering the enclave.After Israel killed at least 436 Palestinians in Gaza on Tuesday and continued brutal air strikes, Houthi leader Abdel-Malik al-Houthi promised in a televised speech to take military escalation to the highest level.The Houthis have claimed five rounds of missile and drone attacks against US aircraft carrier the Harry S Truman and its supporting warships.They announced that they launched a missile towards Israel’s Ben Gurion International Airport. The Israeli military said the missile was intercepted.For its part, Iran has warned that all-out regional war could break out if it is attacked.Iran’s mission to the UN also wrote a letter this week to the Security Council to condemn “reckless and provocative” statements by Trump.Hardliners in Tehran have increasingly signalled they will push to build a nuclear bomb if the existence of the Iranian establishment is threatened.","‘Every shot fired’: Are Yemen’s Houthis a proxy force for Iran?","2025-06-24T20:40:56.335541Z"

Earlier this week, agents detained Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown’s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, which Hashemi directs.“It’s shocking, and it sort of confirms our worst fears that authoritarian repression on American universities is expanding under the Trump administration,” said Hashemi.Civil liberties groups and rights observers have decried — and challenged — Khalil’s attempted deportation, which Hashemi and other observers describe as an extension of the anti-Palestinian bias in the US government.That has often involved conflating anti-Jewish sentiment and support for Hamas, which the US categorises as a “terrorist organisation”, with statements criticising Israeli military action or support for Palestinians, they say.But Hashemi and his colleagues see the targeting of Suri, who is in the US on a student visa, as going a step further, given that he was detained not for public protests but for his alleged personal views.Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown who focuses on Palestinian-Israel affairs, said the Trump administration’s enforcement efforts appear to be entering “a different realm with this case”, extending beyond student visa holders and US residents sanctioned for their protest activity.“This person seems to have been targeted, not for his activism,” he said, “but simply for being suspected of holding certain views.”For its part, the US Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday confirmed that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had approved Suri’s deportation.Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Rubio made the determination by citing the same law used to justify the attempted deportation of Khalil.It is a provision of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act that gives the secretary of state power to remove any non-citizen whose presence in the US is deemed to have “adverse foreign policy consequences”.McLaughlin accused Suri of “actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media”, without providing further details. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for further information from Al Jazeera.She also said Suri “has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior adviser to Hamas”.On Wednesday, Suri’s wife, Mapheze Saleh, confirmed to Al Jazeera that she is a US citizen. Meanwhile, Ahmed Yousef, a former adviser to assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, confirmed to The New York Times that Suri was his son-in-law.Yousef told the newspaper he had left his position in the political wing of Hamas over a decade ago and has publicly criticised the group’s decision to attack Israel on October 7, 2023. He said that Suri was not involved in “political activism”, much less support for Hamas.Suri has roundly rejected the allegations against him, his lawyer, Hassan Ahmad, told US media. His legal team, which includes the Virginia office of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), has filed a petition at the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia seeking his release.He remained at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centre in Louisiana on Thursday.In a statement on Wednesday, Georgetown University also said it supports its community members “rights to free and open deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable”.Meanwhile, the Alwaleed Center issued a passionate defence of Suri on Thursday, saying he has become the victim of a “campaign by the Trump Administration to destroy higher education in the United States and punish their political opponents”.Both Suri and his wife Saleh had previously been singled out by “Campus Watch”, a project out of the Middle East Forum that says it “reviews and critiques Middle East studies in North American universities”.Critics have accused the project of being a tool to silence criticism of Israel in higher education.Hashemi, meanwhile, described Suri as a “very respected and serious academic”.“In many ways, [Suri] was the exact opposite to Mahmoud Khalil, in the sense that he was not an organiser or a leader. He was simply a researcher and postdoctoral fellow at our centre,” Hashemi said, “who was just working on themes of minority rights, majoritarianism and the problem of authoritarianism.”Elgindy, meanwhile, said the Trump administration continues to embrace a “dangerous conflation” when it comes to complex discussions of Palestinian rights and resistance.“Really any expression of solidarity with Palestinians or criticism of Israel is deemed in and of itself, to be both anti-Semitic and inherently supportive of terrorism and Hamas,” he said.Elgindy described a “genuine atmosphere of fear” when it comes to open academic debate on the complex realities that define the Israel-Palestine conflict.“It really cuts to the heart of academic freedom — if people have to censor themselves, if students are afraid to ask certain questions or raise certain points because maybe someone in the class is recording and is going to share with some of these extremist groups out there that have been doxxing students,” he said.“The intent is to chill debate and to make people second guess whether they should express certain views at all.”On Thursday, Congressman Don Beyer, who represents northern Virginia, also weighed in on Suri’s detainment, calling it a violation of his right to “due process” and a “blatant attack on the First Amendment”, referring to the US Constitution’s protections for freedom of speech.His statement offered a preview of the principles likely to be raised in federal courts.The Trump administration has taken the broad position that those constitutional rights are not extended to temporary visa holders or even US permanent residents.But courts have largely upheld the right of immigrants to enjoy free speech, the freedom of assembly and other basic liberties.Beyer called for a judge to swiftly make a ruling on Suri’s challenge to his imminent deportation, pointing to “the administration’s track record of attempting to deny constitutional rights in ways that are difficult to undo before judicial remedies can be provided”.Late Thursday, a federal judge barred the Trump administration from immediately deporting Suri. His lawyers told Reuters news agency he was awaiting a date for a hearing in immigration court.Both Hashemi and Elgindy, meanwhile, pointed to the need for the academic community to take a firm stand against Trump’s actions, while acknowledging the difficult landscape educators and administrators face.Beyond the risks to professors on temporary work visas, Trump has also pledged to cut federal funds to institutions that do not take severe enough measures against protesters and “agitators”.His administration has already cut $400m in grants and contracts for Columbia University.“I think the worst is yet to come,” Hashemi said. “Unless the people stand up and push back.”","Georgetown researcher arrest escalates Trump speech crackdown, scholars say","2025-06-24T20:33:19.253310Z"

And let’s be clear; this happened to him simply because President Trump wants to silence anyone he suspects to hold a political opinion contrary to his,” Arastu told Al Jazeera.“ICE kidnappings are not new. Every week, thousands of families are torn apart as ICE agents detain individuals without cause, often for no reason other than their political beliefs. This is part of a larger pattern of racially motivated attacks on immigrant communities under the Trump administration.”Suri is currently being held at an ICE detention facility at Alexandria International Airport in Louisiana, according to ICE’s online detention locator.Ahmad Hassan, a lawyer representing Suri, on Wednesday filed a petition for the researcher’s release at the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, according to a court filing.Hassan did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Al Jazeera.Suri’s wife, Mapheze Saleh, confirmed to Al Jazeera that she is a US citizen.She directed further questions to Suri’s legal representatives.In a statement to Al Jazeera, a spokesperson for Georgetown University said Suri had been granted a student visa to carry out “doctoral research on peace-building in Iraq and Afghanistan”.“We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention,” the spokesperson said.“We support our community members’ rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.”An X account using Suri’s name, likeness, and Georgetown University affiliation made a number of criticisms of Israel and expressions of support for the Palestinian cause.In a post in June, the account accused India of being “an enabler of genocide” after the Palestinian-run Quds News Network posted footage purporting to show the remnants of an Israeli missile labelled “Made in India”.“From being an ally of Palestinians, to enabler of a genocide. What a disgrace for Made in India, to supply missiles to Israel so that Palestinian children can be butchered,” the post said.“Change of values for blood money. Shame.”In an October 2023 post, the account said many Indians supported Israel for the “hate of Muslims”, not “for the love of Israel”.Another post that month said that viewing Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel as the start of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ignored history stretching back to 1948 and took away the “right to resist by all means which international laws [sic] gives to Palestinians.”Suri’s detention comes less than two weeks after the DHS arrested Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil over his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests.On Wednesday, a federal court ruled that Khalil, a permanent US resident, could proceed with a legal challenge against the Trump administration’s order for his deportation.Judge Jesse Furman ruled that Khalil’s argument that his removal would violate his free speech and due process rights under the US Constitution warranted “careful review”.","Trump moves to deport Indian pro-Palestinian Georgetown University student","2025-07-15T20:47:19.200200Z"

Health authorities said at least three people were killed in a house in Gaza City, while another airstrike left two men dead and wounded six others in Beit Hanoun town in the north.Palestinian medics also said Israeli tank shelling on Salahdeen road killed one Palestinian and wounded others, while an Israeli airstrike killed three people in a house in Beit Lahiya town north of the enclave.In central Gaza, Palestinians reported an attack on a home near a mosque in Deir el-Balah area, while Israeli helicopter fire and artillery shelling were reported east of the Bureij refugee camp.The Gaza Health Ministry said a UN foreign staffer was killed and five other workers were wounded in an airstrike on the site of a UN headquarters in the center of the enclave.Jorge Moreira da Silva, Executive Director of the UN office for Project Services, said: “Israel knew that this was a UN premises, that people were living, staying and working there, it is a compound. It is a very well-known place.”An explosive device was dropped or fired on the premises, he told a press conference in Brussels. “This was not an accident,” he said. “What’s happening in Gaza is unconscionable.”The Israeli military said it hit overnight a Hamas site in northern Gaza where it had detected preparations for firing into Israeli territory.Wednesday’s violence comes after more than 400 Palestinians were killed, many of them children, as Israel resumed its full-fledged bombing of Gaza on Tuesday, breaking a fragile truce with Hamas that had been in place since January 19.The Gaza Health Ministry said on Wednesday that at least 436 people have been killed since Israel resumed its bombardment.Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said people in Gaza were left “terrified, helpless and devastated” following the attacks amid the Israeli blockade of aid and electricity cuts.“People are starving. They do not have access to food. The water desalination plant that was providing water for 500,000 Palestinians is not working [due to Israel cutting off electricity],” she said. “With all this happening, Palestinians wake up to a massive series of attacks in different areas of Gaza.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday the renewed bombing of Gaza was “only the beginning” and that Israel would press ahead until it achieves all of its war aims — destroying Hamas and freeing all the captives.Israel’s resumption of attacks drew widespread condemnation, including from United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who said he was “outraged by the Israeli air strikes in Gaza”.China’s European envoy Fu Cong regretted the “harm done to the hard-won ceasefire”. Several lawmakers in the United States also condemned the Israeli attacks, with Senator Bernie Sanders calling for an end to US military aid to Israel.Israel’s opposition leader and former Prime Minister Yair Lapid called on the public to rally against Netanyahu’s government, accusing it of having “no red lines”.The entire nation must “come together and say: ‘Enough!'”, wrote Lapid in a post on X on Wednesday. “I’m calling on all of you – this is our moment, this is our future, this is our country. Take to the streets!” he added.Thousands of Israelis packed a Tel Aviv square on Tuesday evening to demand the government resume negotiations for a captive deal.The main group representing the families of the captives held in Gaza accused the government of “deliberately dismantling” the ceasefire.“Today Netanyahu did not open the gates of hell on Hamas. He opened the gates of hell on our loved ones,” said Einav Zangauker, whose son is among the captives.","Aid worker among dozens killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza","2025-07-15T17:46:39.928475Z"

The attack killed so many people from my family, some of them we still haven’t recovered from under the rubble.”Ahmed Abu Rizq, a teacher, recounted the initial hours of the Israeli attacks, which added to the state of sheer horror and panic being witnessed at the hospitals.“We woke up frightened, hearing Israeli strikes everywhere in Gaza. If you’re now in one of Gaza’s hospitals, you will see blood everywhere,” said Abu Rizq, adding that he had seen families arriving at hospital with the “remains of their children” in their hands.Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said that Israel’s strikes had once again turned Gaza into a “killing box”.“Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City is overwhelmed with the number of mass casualties arriving,” said Mahmoud. “We’ve seen entire families [killed] brought here, including a family of 26, with women, children and elderly. We’ve seen a mother here, crying over the bodies of her two daughters.“Last night’s attacks prove again that there is no safe place across Gaza. People had gone back to bombed homes and evacuation centres, thinking it was going to be safe due to the ceasefire, but that was not the case.

Why is this happening? How did we get here?Here is what we know:Israel killed more than 400 people in overnight attacks on Tuesday, launching air raids as people slept in the early hours of the morning.The office of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement announcing the resumption of Israel’s war on Gaza.According to reports, Israeli raids targeted the northern, central, and southern governorates.Al Jazeera Arabic reported that Israeli tanks shelled the town of Abasan in Khan Younis.Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abou Azzoum said, “Most of the air strikes have been on heavily built-up neighbourhoods, makeshift schools and residential buildings where people are taking shelter.”At least 404 people have been reported killed by Israel in just a few hours.Images emerging from the ground showed children among the victims. There is an unknown number of people still under the rubble.The Government Media Office said: “Most of these martyrs and missing persons are women, children, and the elderly”, adding that in some cases, “entire families” had been killed.Israel claims it is doing this to force Hamas to release the captives being held in Gaza.It also claims it knows that Hamas was rearming and planning a new attack.However, “Israel itself had decided to remove itself from the negotiations for phase two of this deal that would ultimately see an end to the war and the release of all 59 Israeli captives still being held in Gaza”, Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut said.Israel had been trying to avoid moving to the second phase of the ceasefire, with backing from the United States, while Hamas has argued that the deal should continue to phase two, as initially agreed upon.Hamas released a statement on its Telegram accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire and continuing its genocide.It called the attacks a “blatant violation of all international and humanitarian conventions” and said the perilous humanitarian situation and lack of fuel on the ground meant many of the wounded died because they were unable to reach hospitals.What has been the US response?The White House said Israel consulted the US before resuming the attacks.There are about 59 Israeli captives left in Gaza, of whom less than half are believed to still be alive, according to the Israeli government.Hamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire and risking the lives of the captives.The forum of families of captives in Israel said “their greatest fear has come true” and blamed their government for giving up on the captives.“We are shocked, angry, and scared about the deliberate disruption of the process to return our loved ones from the terrible captivity of Hamas,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.We told you about the Israeli claims and how the negotiations actually went.In retrospect, Israel may have never intended to leave Gaza or stop the war.When both sides agreed to a ceasefire, Israel refused to state in writing that it would not resume hostilities after the first phase.Hamas still agreed to the terms after receiving verbal guarantees from mediators – Egypt, Qatar and the US – that Israel would not restart its genocidal war against Palestinians.The US, which supplies most of Israel’s arms and provides it with unwavering support, is the only country with real leverage against Israel, and it is clear that it has again reneged on its promise to protect Palestinian lives from unlawful – likely criminal – Israeli violence.That is very, very hard to believe.Israel’s war in Gaza is also part of a wider conflict it is waging across the region, claiming that it is necessary for its security.It has been bombing southern Lebanon pretty much since a ceasefire was signed between it and the Lebanese government. On March 16, it killed four people in two villages.The same night, Israel killed two people in the Syrian city of Deraa, claiming it was targeting remnants of the regime of ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, although it is not clear why that concerns them.What is more, Israel is continuing its violent campaign of raids on occupied West Bank refugee camps, claiming to be trying to root out Palestinian fighters.However, experts previously told Al Jazeera that armed groups in Palestinian refugee camps do not pose a threat to Israel, having formed in 2021 mostly to respond to Israel’s violent, frequent raids on the camps and its entrenching and increasingly violent occupation, which violates international law.","Why did Israel break the ceasefire in Gaza?","2025-06-24T20:31:52.306231Z"

It called on people in Arab and Islamic nations, along with the “free people of the world”, to take to the streets to protest the assault.The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) armed group accused Israel of “deliberately sabotaging all efforts to reach a ceasefire”.Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he ordered the military to take “strong action” against Hamas over its refusal to release captives taken from Israel or agree to offers to extend the ceasefire.“Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.The Israeli military said on Telegram that it was conducting “extensive strikes on terror targets” belonging to Hamas.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Israel had consulted with United States President Donald Trump about the strikes.Ahmed Abu Rizq, a teacher in Gaza, said he and his family woke up to the sound of “Israeli strikes everywhere”.“We were frightened, our children were frightened. We had many calls from our relatives to check, to check [on] ourselves. And the ambulance started to run from one street to another,” Abu Rizq told Al Jazeera, adding that families started to arrive at the local hospital with the “remains of their children” in their hands.Reporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said the strikes were concentrated on heavily built-up neighbourhoods, makeshift schools and residential buildings where people have been sheltering.“We have heard in the past hour a clear presence of Israeli drones and fighter jets across the skies in the central area and we understand that among those who were found as victims during the attack were newborn babies, children, women and the elderly,” Abu Azzoum said, adding that several high-ranking Hamas officials had also been killed.The Government Media Office in Gaza said: “These brutal massacres committed by the Israeli occupation army reaffirm that this occupation only understands the language of killing, destruction, and genocide.“They expose the true intentions of the occupation in shedding the blood of innocent people without the slightest moral or legal restraint, proving that they have a premeditated plan to continue committing genocide against children and women, as seen on the ground. It confirms that this is an occupation thirsty for blood.”Negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire deal, which would see the release of nearly 60 remaining captives and the establishment of a permanent ceasefire, have been at an impasse over Israel’s insistence that the first stage be extended until mid-April.Hamas has released about three dozen captives in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners since the start of the ceasefire.While Israel did not explicitly declare an end to the ceasefire, senior officials indicated that the assault on Gaza would continue.Israeli Minister of Defence Israel Katz said the “gates of hell” would open in the enclave if the remaining captives were not released.“We will not stop fighting until all of the hostages return home and all the war’s aims are achieved,” Katz said in a statement.Reporting from Jordan’s Amman, Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut said that while Israel has accused Hamas of rejecting various proposals made by negotiators, talks had been stalled after Netanyahu refused to begin negotiations on phase two of the ceasefire deal on February 6.“Several Israeli analysts, several within the political opposition and several within Netanyahu’s own government said that this was the plan all along – a resumption of the fighting, to go back to full-scale war,” Salhut said.“And in fact, there’s a new army chief of staff, one who said that 2025 is going to be a year of war – noting that Israel still has a lot of goals to accomplish when it comes to the Gaza Strip, meaning that they are in no way finished with their military action.”Israel’s 18-month war on Gaza has levelled much of the enclave, reducing homes, hospitals and schools to rubble.Israeli forces have so far killed more than 48,000 people in the territory, according to Palestinian health authorities.","At least 404 killed as Israel unleashes strikes on Gaza, breaking ceasefire","2025-06-24T20:37:26.179488Z"

After the Houthis said last week they would resume targeting Israeli-linked shipping in the Red Sea due to Israel’s ongoing blockade of Gaza, the US launched a series of large-scale attacks on Yemen over the weekend, killing dozens of people and wounding many more.In a statement posted on Telegram, the Houthi spokesperson said the attack was “in retaliation to the continued American aggression against our country”.The US has not responded to the claimed strike. However, US Central Command posted a video on X saying its “forces continue operations against Iran-backed Houthi terrorists”.The Houthi-backed SABA news agency reported two new air raids early on Monday around the port city of Hodeidah, about 230km (143 miles) from the capital Sanaa.Citing local authorities, SABA also reported that US forces carried out strikes on a cancer facility being built in the city of Saada on Sunday, causing “widespread destruction”.The Houthis, who control much of the Arabian Peninsula’s poorest country, maintained a campaign targeting the busy sea route off the coast of Yemen as Israel bombarded Gaza over the past 18 months.The attacks affected global trade, forcing a significant volume of maritime traffic between Asia and Europe away from the Suez Canal to take the far longer journey around Africa.The group halted its drone and missile attacks, which had targeted vessels with tenuous Israeli links, when the Gaza ceasefire was declared in January.However, the Yemeni group said last week it was “resuming the ban on the passage of all Israeli ships” in the Red Sea due to Israel’s renewed blockade of the Palestinian enclave.On Saturday, President Donald Trump ordered the US military to strike at the Houthis.The attacks killed at least 53 people and injured many more, most of them women and children, according to the Reuters news agency.

They said it was unclear how much progress the efforts made or at what level the discussions took place.The development comes more than a month after US President Donald Trump floated the idea of forcibly displacing Palestinians and “taking over” the Gaza Strip. It was roundly rejected by Palestinians and countries in the Middle East, with many describing it as ethnic cleansing.Separate outreach from the US and Israel to the three potential destinations began last month, days after Trump floated the Gaza plan alongside Netanyahu, according to the US officials, who said Israel was taking the lead in the discussions.There was no immediate reaction to the report from the US or Israel.But Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a longtime advocate of what he calls “voluntary” emigration of Palestinians, said this week that Israel is working to identify countries to take them in. He also said Israel is preparing a “very large emigration department” within its Ministry of Defense.Tamer Qarmout, an associate professor at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera the forced displacement of Palestinians is “a red line that should not be crossed”.He said governments around the world have a responsibility to stop the “outrageous” proposal and “should not be engaging with Israel on any of these scenarios”, especially the displacement of Palestinians to African countries, “many of which continue to struggle from colonial legacies”.“Sudan and Somalia are still ravaged by wars due to the colonial legacy. They [the Israeli government] have to be exposed and put on a shame list,” Qarmout added.In exchange for accepting resettled Palestinians, it is thought that a variety of incentives – financial, diplomatic and security – would be offered to the East African governments.A US official involved in the efforts confirmed to AP that the US was “having a quiet conversation with Somaliland about a range of areas where they can be helpful to the US in exchange for recognition”.The US could offer the breakaway region of more than 3 million people international recognition, which is a priority for Somaliland’s new president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi.Abdirahman Dahir Adan, Somaliland’s foreign minister, told the Reuters news agency denied the breakaway region’s authorities having received a proposal.“I haven’t received such a proposal, and there are no talks with anyone regarding Palestinians,” he said.Meanwhile, it is difficult to understand why Somalia would want to host Palestinians given the country’s strong support for Palestinian self-rule, Sambu Chepkorir, a lawyer and conflict researcher in Nairobi, told AP.“The realignments keep changing, and so maybe there is a hidden agenda in why Somalia,” Chepkorir said.Two Sudanese officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic matter, confirmed the Trump administration has approached the military-led government about accepting Palestinians.One said the contacts began even before Trump’s inauguration, with offers of military assistance against the RSF paramilitary group, assistance with postwar reconstruction and other incentives.Both officials said the Sudanese government rejected the idea. “This suggestion was immediately rebuffed,” said one official. “No one opened this matter again.”","US, Israel want to displace Palestinians from Gaza to East Africa: Report","2025-06-24T20:23:58.586241Z"

The arrest has been roundly condemned by civil liberty groups, who have called Khalil a “political prisoner”.The leaders of Thursday’s demonstration said they chose Trump Tower to send a message to the president. The high-rise houses both the Trump Organization and Trump’s personal New York residence.“As Jews, we are taking over the Trump Tower to register our mass refusal,” Jewish Voice for Peace, which organised the protest, wrote in a post on the social media platform X.“We will not stand by as this fascist regime attempts to criminalise Palestinians and all those calling for an end to the Israeli government’s US-funded genocide of the Palestinian people. And we will never stop fighting for a free Palestine.”Among the protesters was actress Deborah Winger, who told The Associated Press news agency she was “standing up for my rights”.“I’m standing up for Mahmoud Khalil, who has been abducted illegally and taken to an undisclosed location,” she added. “Does that sound like America to you?”Reporting from New York, Al Jazeera’s Kristen Saloomey said there were several “dramatic moments” as police arrested 98 of the protesters while clearing the lobby.“The demonstrators basically went in nonchalantly, dressed as normal tourists,” Saloomey said. “Then they took off their jackets, wearing red T-shirts that represented their cause. On behalf of Mahmoud Khalil, they said, ‘Not in our name’.”“Ninety-eight of them who were dragged out in handcuffs are being processed and charged with misdemeanour crimes.”While a federal judge has blocked Khalil from being removed from the US, pending a legal challenge, he remains in detention in Louisiana.His lawyers have requested he be moved to New York for the proceedings and to be closer to his wife, who is eight months pregnant.Speaking during a court hearing yesterday, Khalil’s lawyer Ramzi Kassem said he was “identified, targeted, detained and is being processed for deportation on account of his advocacy for Palestinian rights”.For its part, the Trump administration has remained defiant in its efforts to expel Khalil.White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt has told reporters Khalil was subject to removal under a law that allows for the deportation of green-card holders deemed by the US secretary of state to be “adversarial to the foreign policy and national security interests” of the country.She repeated the claim that Khalil supported “terrorists”, without offering any evidence.Trump, meanwhile, has said Khalil’s arrest is the “first of many to come”.In a separate court proceeding on Thursday, eight Columbia students – including Khalil – were named as plaintiffs in a petition seeking to bar the university from complying with an order to share student disciplinary records with the government.The House Committee on Education and Labor has sought records for students involved in pro-Palestine protests, as part of its attempts to crack down on anti-Semitism on campus.The students said the congressional committee’s request violated the First Amendment and their privacy rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a US law that governs how universities handle student information.“Entities like the university feel pressure to cooperate with the government in its efforts to chill and punish protected speech,” the lawsuit stated.","Arrests at Trump Tower as Mahmoud Khalil demonstrations continue","2025-07-15T19:40:16.481995Z"

He remained in detention on Sunday. Khalil’s wife declined to comment through one of Khalil’s fellow students.Khalil’s lawyer, Amy Greer, told the Associated Press news agency that she spoke by phone with one of the ICE agents during the arrest, who said they were acting on State Department orders to revoke Khalil’s student visa. Informed by the lawyer that Khalil was in the country as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer.Greer said the authorities declined to tell Khalil’s wife, who is eight months pregnant, whether he was accused of committing a crime. Khalil has since been transferred to an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey.“We have not been able to get any more details about why he is being detained,” Greer told the AP. “This is a clear escalation. The administration is following through on its threats.”The arrest appeared to be among the first known actions under President Donald Trump’s pledge to deport international students who joined the protests against Israel’s war in Gaza that swept college campuses last year. His administration has claimed participants forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas, which is designated as a ‘terror’ organisation by the US.The move has been described as an attack on First Amendment freedoms.Khalil, an Algerian citizen of Palestinian origin, has been one of the school administrators’ lead negotiators of the pro-Palestinian student protesters, some of whom set up a tent encampment on a Columbia lawn last year and seized control of an academic building for several hours in April before police entered the campus to arrest them. Khalil was not in the group that occupied the building but was a mediator between Columbia provosts and the protesters.The protesting students called for Columbia’s divestment from companies with ties to Israel, a ceasefire and an end to the war that killed nearly 50,000 Palestinians and turned the enclave into rubble after nonstop bombardment. The US provided the bulk of the ammunition for the war.Columbia said last year that it would consider expediting some of the students’ demands through its investments committee.Rights groups have accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza – home to 2.3 million people. Despite a ceasefire in place since January 19, Israel has blocked the entry of any aid into Gaza since March 1, drawing condemnation from rights groups and aid agencies.The October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and subsequent Israeli military offensive on Gaza led to months of pro-Palestinian protests that roiled US college campuses.At least 1,100 people were killed in the Hamas attack and some 240 people were taken captive. Most of the captives have been released as part of truce deals. A new round of truce talks will resume in the Qatari capital, Doha, on Monday.A spokesperson for Columbia said the school was barred by law from sharing information about individual students.The Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, which oversees the country’s visa system, did not respond to questions from the news agencies. It was not immediately clear on what grounds ICE agents arrested Khalil. The ICE comes under the US Department of Homeland Security.In an interview with the Reuters news agency a few hours before his arrest on Saturday about the Trump administration’s criticism of Columbia, Khalil said he was concerned that he was being targeted by the government for speaking to the media.The Trump administration on Friday said it had cancelled government contracts and grants worth about $400m to Columbia University. The government said the cuts and the student deportation efforts are due to “anti-Semitic” harassment at and near Columbia’s Manhattan campus.“What more can Columbia do to appease Congress or the government now?” Khalil said before his arrest, noting that Columbia had twice called in police to arrest protesters and had disciplined many pro-Palestinian students and staff, suspending some.“They basically silenced anyone supporting Palestine on campus and this was not enough. Clearly, Trump is using the protesters as a scapegoat for his wider agenda [of] fighting and attacking higher education and the Ivy League education system.”In response to the announced grant cuts on Friday, Columbia’s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, said the school was committed to combating anti-Semitism and was “working with the federal government to address their legitimate concerns”.Protesting students have denied the charges of anti-Semitism.Maryam Alwan, a Palestinian American senior at Columbia who has protested alongside Khalil, said the Trump administration was dehumanising Palestinians.“I am horrified for my dear friend Mahmoud, who is a legal resident, and I am horrified that this is only the beginning,” she said.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week that international students who support Hamas, which the US has designated a “terrorist” organisation, face visa revocation and deportation.On Thursday, Columbia issued a revised protocol for how students and school staff should handle ICE agents seeking to enter private school property.The school said ICE agents without a judicial arrest warrant may be allowed to enter its private property in “exigent circumstances”, which it did not specify.“By allowing ICE on campus, Columbia is surrendering to the Trump administration’s assault on universities across the country and sacrificing international students to protect its finances,” the Student Workers of Columbia said in its statement.Khalil lives in a university apartment building near Columbia’s main gated campus.","Mahmoud Khalil, student leader of Columbia protests, arrested","2025-07-15T20:35:28.210374Z"

Nearly 50,000 Palestinians have been killed and vast swathes of Gaza have been turned into rubble after non-stop Israeli bombardment.Israel wants to extend the first phase of the three-phase deal, while the Hamas group wants the deal to move to phase two, as initially agreed by both sides. Analysts say Israel’s refusal to enter phase two shows its unwillingness to withdraw its troops from the Philadelphi Corridor, a narrow strip of land that separates Gaza from Egypt.Hamas has accused Israel of “cheap and unacceptable blackmail” over its decision to halt the electricity supply to war-ravaged Gaza in an effort to pressure the group into releasing the captives.“We strongly condemn the occupation’s decision to cut off electricity to Gaza, after depriving it of food, medicine, and water,” Ezzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas’s political bureau said in a statement, adding that it was “a desperate attempt to pressure our people and their resistance through cheap and unacceptable blackmail tactics”.Aid groups and rights campaigners have accused Israel of committing crimes against humanity and violating international humanitarian laws for cutting off aid.People in Gaza are struggling to get bread and basic supplies as Israel’s total blockade has forced the closure of several bakeries and shops.Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Gaza City, said that despite the end to the devasting air strikes on Gaza, civilians continue to suffer due to more than one week of Israeli blockade in place.“Many Palestinians are unable to buy these products, and most of Gaza’s population is currently relying on food assistance.“Food, water and electricity, all aspects of Palestinian life are being affected by Israeli actions,” Khoudary said, adding that the situation on the ground remains “catastrophic”.Hamas has repeatedly called for an immediate start to negotiations on the ceasefire’s second phase. A Hamas source stated on Sunday that its delegation had now left for Doha, Qatar after talks in Cairo, Egypt.Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Khan Younis, said the Hamas representatives were in Cairo to hold meetings with Egyptian officials on the possibilities of implementing the second phase of the ceasefire agreement.“Hamas issued a statement agreeing to the establishment of a technocratic independent committee that will run the Gaza Strip and reiterated calls for the entry of humanitarian aid,” Azzoum added, saying that the group is also calling for Israel’s full withdrawal from the territory as part of any future deal.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, meanwhile, said it would send delegates to Doha on Monday.Earlier on Sunday, two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli attack in Gaza, according to an Al Jazeera correspondent, as fresh truce talks are set to resume in Doha from Monday.The attack on Sunday in Gaza City’s Shujayea neighbourhood wounded several others, with doctors at al-Ahli Arab Hospital describing the condition of some of the injured as critical.Israel’s military said its air strike targeted fighters who “were identified operating in proximity to [Israeli] troops and attempting to plant an explosive device in the ground in northern Gaza”.Al Jazeera’s Khoudary said that Israel has continued to violate the ceasefire that came into effect on January 19. “According to official sources, since the beginning of the Gaza ceasefire, at least 116 Palestinians have been killed and at least 490 others wounded,” she said.“This is why Palestinians are waiting for phase two of the ceasefire, when all Israeli soldiers are supposed to withdraw from all parts of the Gaza Strip.”The six-week first phase saw the release of 25 living Israeli captives and eight bodies in exchange for some 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.During the second phase, Hamas is expected to release all the remaining living captives, mostly male soldiers, in return for the freeing of more Palestinians held in the Israeli prison system. In addition, according to the document agreed to in January, Israel would initiate its “complete withdrawal” from Gaza.The third phase will see the bodies of the remaining captives handed over in return for a three- to five-year reconstruction plan for Gaza to be conducted under international supervision.On Sunday, United States President Donald Trump’s envoy Adam Boehler told NBC News that direct US meetings with Hamas in Doha on the release of captives in Gaza were extremely “helpful”.Boehler stated that he believes something could “come together on Gaza within weeks”, but did not elaborate.Trump had previously floated a widely condemned plan to expel Palestinians from Gaza, prompting Arab leaders to offer an alternative.Their proposal would see Gaza’s reconstruction financed through a trust fund, with the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority returning to govern the territory.“We need more discussion about it, but it’s a good-faith first step,” Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy, told reporters in Washington in response to the Arab plan.Witkoff will be returning to the region this week as he travels to Saudi Arabia for talks on the war in Ukraine.Meanwhile, family members of Israeli captives have demanded the government fully implement the ceasefire.“The war could resume in a week,” Einav Zangauker, the mother of Matan Zangauker, told a crowd in Tel Aviv.“The war won’t bring the hostages back home; it will kill them.”Yoni Ben Menachem, an analyst based in West Jerusalem, says Israel’s return to ceasefire negotiations is a “genuine decision” by the government because it wants to secure the release of the remaining captives.However, “the military option” remains on the table and that could be decided on Sunday evening when Israel’s cabinet meets, he said.Hamas has said that it was ready to abandon its governance role in Gaza but refused to lay down arms.Meanwhile, Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank have continued unabated. On Sunday, Israeli tanks entered areas in and around the village of Wadi Burqin, according to local media reports.The ongoing Israeli operation in Jenin, Tulkarem and other areas began days after the ceasefire in Gaza, with dozens killed, hundreds of homes destroyed, and more than 40,000 people displaced.","Israel cuts off electricity supply to Gaza as new truce talks set to resume","2025-06-24T20:19:42.482601Z"

Al Jazeera correspondents on the ground reported that one person was also killed by Israeli fire in at-Tannour, also east of Rafah.Since Friday night, Rafah has been the target of intense Israeli attacks from tanks and drones with shelling impacting residential areas, including al-Jnaina, ash-Shawka and Tal as-Sultan, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, at least 48,453 Palestinians have been killed and 111,860 wounded by Israeli attacks since October 7, 2023.At the same time, the head of the enclave’s Government Media Office reported on Saturday in marking International Women’s Day that 12,316 women have been killed throughout the war.“Women’s Day coincides with the continuation of the Israeli siege and the prevention of aid as women live in catastrophic humanitarian conditions and suffer from starvation and thirst,” Salama Maarouf said.At least 2,000 women and girls have been permanently disabled due to amputations, according to government data.Civilians in Gaza are also continuing to struggle with a dire humanitarian crisis exacerbated by Israel’s decision last week to block aid deliveries into Gaza until Hamas accepted its terms for an extension of a ceasefire that had largely halted more than 15 months of fighting.On Saturday, a Hamas statement said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government was “committing the war crime of collective punishment against over two million Palestinian civilians through starvation and the deprivation of basic life necessities for the seventh consecutive day”.“The repercussions of such crime extend beyond our people in Gaza to include the occupation’s prisoners [captives] held by the resistance, who are also affected by the lack of food, medicine and healthcare,” it added.The first phase of the Israel-Hamas truce, which ended on March 1, had enabled the entry of vital food, shelter and medical assistance into Gaza. However, there has been no agreement on what comes next.Hamas has pushed for the second phase of the truce, which had been agreed to in principle, to begin. That phase would eventually see a complete end to fighting in exchange for the release of the remaining captives held by Hamas.The Israeli government, meanwhile, has pushed for extending the first phase until mid-April to achieve the release of more captives. That plan would not rule out an eventual return to fighting.On Friday, a senior Hamas delegation arrived in the Egyptian capital Cairo to meet mediators to work on establishing the next phase of the truce.On Saturday, A Hamas spokesperson said there were “positive indicators” that talks on the second phase could soon begin.

Today, that truce comes to an end,” Khoudary reported.“Palestinians are very anxious and stressed that the second phase of the ceasefire hasn’t taken effect yet. People here are waiting for any news from these negotiations and feel that this ceasefire is fragile.”As Palestinians wait for news of the ceasefire, the Israeli blockade of humanitarian aid is putting immense pressure on people already struggling to get by, she added.“This blockade is suffocating Palestinians. They are saying they never imagined that a ceasefire and Ramadan would come and that they would not be able to cook their favourite dishes,” Khoudary explained, adding that community kitchens are now running out of stock.Meanwhile, more than 50 freed Israeli captives urged Netanyahu to fully implement the Gaza ceasefire and secure the release of those still held in Gaza.“We who have experienced the inferno know that a return to war is life-threatening for those still left behind,” the 56 former captives said in a letter posted on Instagram. “Implement the agreement in full in one single manoeuvre.”","Israeli attacks on Gaza kill three as Hamas, Egypt hold ceasefire talks","2025-06-28T10:41:18.382390Z"

I had a large shop, a six-storey building, a car, and stock warehouses in Tel al-Hawa in Gaza City. All those years of hard work vanished, destroyed in the war.“Everywhere you look is destruction, ruin, and misery. Is there anything left for us to grieve?“Trump or whoever, it makes no difference.”Displaced southwards during the war, al-Sharafa and his family returned to the north after the ceasefire began, only to find a devastated area where life is barely possible.“Even if we hand over the captives, nothing will change. The war might return at any moment under a new pretext they come up with. We’ve lost trust in the entire world.”Jamila Mahmoud, 62, did not hear Trump’s exact words, but some of her family members discussed it on Thursday morning.“As you see, we’re completely cut off from everything. No internet, no electricity, no means of communication,” she said.Mahmoud believes Trump’s threats are part of a psychological war aimed at forcing people out of Gaza.“Every time, there’s a new scenario – sometimes, it’s talk of forced displacement; sometimes, it’s Israel taking over Gaza; and today, it’s threats to all of Gaza’s residents over the captives.”“Has Gaza suddenly become the root of all the world’s problems?” she asked.Mahmoud insists that no matter what happens, she will never give up her right to live in Gaza, her homeland.“I will remain on my land, even if it’s just the rubble of my home, no matter what,” she affirmed.Ayman Abu Dayyeh, walking home with a few food items for his family, told Al Jazeera he just wants “Hamas to prioritise the public interest right now – to accept a deal, negotiate, and hand over the captives so this endless nightmare can finally end.”“This is the only reasonable option … our position is weak, and no one’s standing by us,” the 60-year-old added.But he does doubt that handing over the captives will not end the war for Trump and Israel, although it may make a future war less devastating.“I believe the American people will reject these threats. They won’t accept their country leading another genocidal war,” Abu Dayyeh said.“We’ve lost 50,000 people. Two of my sons were killed in this war – in October and December 2023 – two young men in their prime. I lost my home, too. We’ve had enough loss and suffering,” he added.“The Arab states are silent, and the Europeans are silent. How can we continue fighting without any supporters? We’ll be the only victims.”Wael Abu Ahmed, 75, from Sheikh Radwan in northern Gaza City, said he was surprised by Trump’s threats.“What do we have left in Gaza? We’ve witnessed horrors in this war – haven’t they done enough?” he asked, sitting on a roadside curb.“Trump’s statements carry no weight or value. I think he’s just making threats to pressure Hamas. The only thing left for them to do is wipe us out entirely,” he added.Ahmed, a retired bureaucrat and father of five, now lives with his children and grandchildren in a single apartment after their house was repeatedly targeted during Israel’s war.He had refused to evacuate to the south and remained in northern Gaza with his family until the ceasefire.“I’ve lived more years than I have left. I stayed in my home and said: ‘I will die here no matter what.’“Leave us alone. Let us face the disaster that has befallen us – or kill us all and put us out of our misery.

Israel was supposed to withdraw its forces from the Philadelphi Corridor at the end of the first phase on March 1, but it has refused to do so. Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is reportedly expected to visit the region in the coming days to end the deadlock.On Wednesday, the World Food Programme (WFP) said it has food supplies for the Palestinian enclave to keep public kitchens and bakeries open for less than two weeks.Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza, said the blockading of aid was having “a massive negative impact across the Gaza Strip”.“People have been going hungry here … and the market is depleting,” he said.“We see many of the items that used to be available and common, like flour, medicine and other basic necessities, are now either expensive or unavailable.”Rosalia Bollen, a spokesperson for the UN’s children’s agency, said the block on humanitarian aid, including vaccines and ventilators for pre-term babies, “will have devastating real-life consequences” for children and their parents.“If we’re unable to bring that in, routine vaccination will come to a standstill,” she said. “Neonatal units won’t be able to care for preterm babies, so this is a real-life consequence that we’ll be dealing with very, very soon if we’re unable to resume the aid supplies coming in.”Bollen, who is in Gaza, said existing supplies have already been largely distributed throughout the enclave.“The first phase of the ceasefire wasn’t just a pause in hostilities … it really was a lifeline for families here,” she added. “The mood here is very depressed; families that I speak with are deeply worried about what the future is going to hold.”","Israel’s Gaza aid blockade could breach humanitarian law: European nations","2025-07-15T20:41:10.046962Z"

The mission is not yet accomplished.”Speaking before Zamir, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was “determined” to achieve victory in its war.Fighting in Gaza has been halted since January under the first phase of a multistage truce brokered by Qatar and Egypt and supported by the United States that has allowed the exchange of 33 Israeli captives and 5 Thai captives for about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.But some Israeli ministers have warned that their forces could resume fighting if there is no agreement on bringing back the 59 captives that remain.Israeli troops have pulled back from some of their positions in Gaza but talks that were intended to agree on a second phase of the truce that would see the release of the remaining living captives and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces before an end to the war have not begun.Israel has called for an extension of the first phase truce until April to allow the release of the remaining captives, while Hamas has insisted on sticking to the agreement made in January, which calls for talks on a permanent end to the war, before agreeing to any more releases.Zamir’s swearing-in comes as a series of official inquiries have begun to examine the Israeli failures that failed to prevent the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. At least 1,139 people were killed in the attack and approximately 250 others were taken captive in one of the biggest military and security disasters in Israel’s history.Halevi led the military during the Israeli assault on Gaza that has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians and destroyed much of the territory, leaving most of the population sheltering in tents or bombed-out buildings.But he announced in January, soon after the Gaza ceasefire deal was agreed, that he would step down from his command, accepting responsibility for the military’s response to the October 7 attack.On Wednesday, as he handed over his command, he called for a wider examination of the failures on October 7, 2023.“The establishment of a state commission of inquiry is necessary and essential – not to place blame, but first and foremost, to understand the root of the problems and allow for correction,” he said.Both the Israel military and the Shin Bet security agency have acknowledged that their failures allowed the attack to take place, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far resisted a more general inquiry that would look at the responsibility of his government.The new commander will also have to respond to accusations from international bodies, including the United Nations, that Israeli troops committed war crimes during the campaign in Gaza.Israel rejects those charges, but it has indicted some individual reservist soldiers for severe abuse of detainees.Israel says Hamas, which has also been accused of war crimes by United Nations bodies, committed multiple atrocities during the October 7 attack and severely abused Israeli captives in Gaza. Hamas denies the accusations.","Israel’s new army chief Eyal Zamir says Hamas mission ‘not accomplished’","2025-06-28T10:58:16.964426Z"

The Fourth Geneva Convention, adopted in 1949, provides humanitarian protections for civilians in war zones.On Sunday night, Qatar also condemned Israel’s decision to block aid into Gaza and emphasised a “firm rejection of the use of food as a weapon of war and the starvation of civilians”.“We call on the international community to oblige Israel to ensure the safe and sustainable entry of humanitarian aid without obstacles,” Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.The Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, “The Kingdom condemns and denounces the decision by the Israeli occupation government to halt humanitarian aid to Gaza, using it as a tool of blackmail and collective punishment.”It said the decision was “a direct assault on the principles of international humanitarian law amid the ongoing humanitarian crisis faced by the Palestinian people”.Jordan said the Israeli move threatens “to reignite the situation in the sector”.“We stress the need for Israel to stop using starvation as a weapon against Palestinians and innocent people,” its Foreign Ministry said.Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said Israel is once again using “food and water as a weapon of war for political gain”.“When it comes to water, for example, 80 percent of Gaza’s reservoirs have been completely destroyed along with the desalination infrastructure. So there is full reliance on the trucks that are carrying water supplies,” Mahmoud said.“Hospitals, meanwhile, are still struggling. And with the decision to hold all aid coming into Gaza, including medical supplies, they are likely to continue to struggle to provide care for vulnerable groups,” he added.Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said: “Without access to aid, people’s lives are on a knife-edge once again.”The Norwegian Refugee Council’s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, Angelita Caredda, also said blocking aid to Gaza would push its civilian population “beyond collapse”.“The Government of Israel must immediately reverse this decision. International actors must do everything in their power to ensure access to Gaza resumes, so that aid reaches those in need without any further delay or disruption,” Caredda said in a statement.Hamas on Monday accused Israel of trying to derail the next phase of ceasefire talks and called Israel’s decision to cut off aid “a war crime and a blatant attack” on a truce that took a year of negotiations before taking hold in January.On Sunday, Israel said it would back a new proposal by the United States that calls for extending the ceasefire through Ramadan and the Jewish Passover holiday, which ends on April 20.Under that proposal, Hamas would release half the captives on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.But Hamas rejected the proposal, saying it would only release captives according to the original terms of the agreement, which stipulated that Israeli forces would permanently withdraw from Gaza and bring an end to the war.The ceasefire deal halted Israel’s war on Gaza, which killed more than 48,380 people, mostly women and children, and left the enclave in ruins.Last November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.","Arab nations, rights groups condemn Israel’s decision to block Gaza aid","2025-06-28T09:53:42.954500Z"

However, those negotiations apparently bore no fruit.Talks over the second phase of the ceasefire are meant to negotiate a comprehensive end to the fighting in Gaza, including the return of all remaining captives and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territory.According to Israel, there are 59 captives remaining in Gaza, 24 of whom are still believed to be alive.On Thursday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told reporters: “We said we are ready to extend the framework [of phase one] in return for the release of more hostages. If it is possible, we’ll do that.”Sami al-Arian, a professor at Istanbul Zaim University, said it was not clear what will happen next.“The American envoy Steve Witkoff has indicated he wants to explore the idea of extending phase one, which is the Israeli position,” he told Al Jazeera. “So that’s bad news for any negotiations because Hamas won’t agree to this.”Meanwhile, humanitarian organisations have repeatedly said the ceasefire must continue if they are to provide much-needed aid to Palestinians in the coastal enclave, which has been devastated during 15 months of war.“The impact of safe and sustained humanitarian access is evident,” the World Food Programme said in a post on X. “The ceasefire must hold. There can be no going back.”United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday said the coming days are “critical” for the talks on the second phase of the ceasefire.“The ceasefire and hostage release deal must hold. The coming days are critical. The parties must spare no effort to avoid a breakdown of this deal,” Guterres told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Gaza, said there may be “a surge” in military activity “as there’s no obligations any more to sustain the ceasefire”.“That’s been left up in the air as the mediators try to contain this crisis and prevent a return to fighting that will bring nothing but further devastation to the people of Gaza,” he added.While the ceasefire has held since it began on January 19, Gaza’s Government Media Office (GMO) has reported more than 350 violations by Israel, including military incursions, gunfire, air strikes, intensified surveillance and the obstruction of aid since the ceasefire began.According to the GMO, the Israeli army has killed and injured dozens of Palestinians through air strikes as well as shootings since the ceasefire came into effect.The GMO has previously reported delays in allowing displaced families to return to areas in northern Gaza as well as shortfalls in the agreed levels of aid allowed into the enclave.","Hamas rejects Israel’s ‘formulation’ to extend phase one of Gaza ceasefire","2025-06-28T09:54:37.949804Z"

Many Palestinians were also sent to Egypt and the occupied West Bank.Alaa al-Bayari, a Palestinian released to Gaza City, told Al Jazeera that he witnessed “torture, beating, humiliation and everything you can imagine” while in Israeli prison. He met his one-year-old daughter for the first time.“We were kept naked, water was thrown on us and then they used electricity” to torture, he said.Yahya Shrida, a Palestinian prisoner who was released to Ramallah, described Israeli prisons as graveyards.“We have been taken out of suffering. It was as if we have been dug out of our own graves. No prisoner has had the experience of having their own release delayed twice,” he told Reuters news agency.“What we have been through is a situation that the mountains can’t carry.

Families were seen leaving their homes carrying the few belongings they were able to take.On Sunday, the Israeli army sent tanks to the Jenin refugee camp, the first such deployment since its crackdown on the second Intifada in 2002, announcing an “extended stay” for the coming year to fight Palestinian armed groups.The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates said the move was a continuation of Israel’s “genocide, displacement and annexation”.Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority condemned the repeated obstruction of ambulances in the West Bank by Israeli forces, accusing them of violating international humanitarian law.The PA’s governing body signalled more trouble to come ahead of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, which is expected to start on Saturday, warning that Israeli authorities were preparing to “impose unprecedented repressive policies” to further isolate occupied East Jerusalem and its Palestinian surroundings.It said Israel would place limits on the number of Muslim worshippers at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound.

Where was I, who did I treat? Nothing about me,” he said.Of the more than 250 Palestinian healthcare workers – doctors, nurses, paramedics, and other essential medical staff – detained by Israel throughout the war, more than 150 remain in custody, PHRI said.Of the 24 healthcare workers interviewed for the NGO’s report, all said they had not been formally charged or presented with credible evidence against them.Instead, they were threatened, beaten and humiliated, all the while being questioned about captives taken from Israel, tunnels and anything they may have heard about the movements of Hamas.One medic, Dr KJ, recalled being told during an assault: “We will cut off your fingers because you are a dentist.”Another, senior surgeon Dr MT, told the NGO that military dogs were set upon detainees while soldiers watched and laughed. “They made us bark like dogs,” he said.Many of the healthcare workers testified to being sexually and psychologically abused by Israeli soldiers, including being stripped, left in stress positions for hours, receiving threats against their families and being coerced into playing “games” or face further beatings.“On 28th March, the soldiers called me and two other civilian prisoners, aged around 16 and 17 by name,” Dr Alserr recalled.“It was night. They tied us very tightly at our wrists and ankles and put us in a military car. No one told us anything. We drove for around two hours into the hills. All the while they beat us, kicking us, and humiliating us.“They were laughing. I was trying to explain in English that the ties on my wrist were too tight, but they just said I was a doctor so I would be OK.“At around 4am I heard one say in Arabic: “These three are to be hanged.”“I … thought it was the end,” said the surgeon. “I was in pain. They had broken my ribs. Even when they said I was going to be hanged, I didn’t care. I just wanted it to end,” he said.Dr Alserr was not released until late September, reuniting him with his parents, for whom he is the sole care provider.Overall, he endured more than six months in Israeli detention without charge. Half of that time was spent incommunicado, under Israel’s Unlawful Combatants Law.“This is unlawful on numerous counts,” PHRI’s Abbas told Al Jazeera.“It’s illegal firstly, because you can’t just arrest someone on what’s clearly a fishing mission and, secondly, healthcare workers are a protected category under international humanitarian law.”The abuse and starvation that Israel inflicted on healthcare workers is “a moral and legal outrage”, but seemed a matter of policy.“None of [the healthcare workers] were accused of anything or formally charged,” he said. “Others were presented with someone identifying themselves as a judge – sometimes in military uniform, or on the other end of a phone line – who told them they were to remain in custody possibly until the end of the war.“We have no idea who these people were,” he said.“Many of the people we spoke to talked about being victim to sexual violence and humiliation,” Abbas recalled, “the use of dogs either to attack or pee on prisoners seemed to reoccur a lot.“The idea is for the soldiers to rob Palestinian men –  and doctors specifically –  of their dignity. That kind of torture also leaves scars; ones that take a long time to heal.”Reports of Israeli forces torturing healthcare workers for intelligence are longstanding and, according to legal representatives for Kamal Adwan Hospital Director Dr Hussam Abu Safia, who was taken by the Israeli army in December, ongoing.The case of Dr Abu Safia resembles the arbitrary detention of 49-year-old Dr Adnan al-Bursh, who was “likely raped to death” while in Israeli custody, as UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese said in a social media post in November.In August last year, a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report on Israel arresting and torturing Gaza healthcare workers said the matter merited investigation by the International Criminal Court.HRW interviewed several healthcare workers detained by Israel during the forced evacuation of healthcare facilities, noting repeated instances of humiliation, beatings, and forcing prisoners to maintain stress positions. They also reported torture, including rape and sexual abuse by Israeli forces.“Their status as healthcare workers didn’t stop the abuse,” Milena Ansari, a lawyer with HRW who worked on the report said.“Surgeons, paramedics, doctors and nurses were all subjected to abuse. One surgeon told me he was interrogated while still in his scrubs … the soldiers just didn’t care.”A report last year by the UN human rights office (OHCHR) said it was “clear” the wholesale detention of healthcare workers amid a blockade that has, to date, killed some 60,000 Palestinians also contributed to the collapse of a healthcare system desperately trying to mitigate the impact of Israel’s assault on the people of Gaza.Dr Alserr paused the call for five minutes, there was a crisis in his ward that needed his attention.“I hurt deeply,” he said, returning to the phone.“I know I will not heal completely. I just hide it with work. and by keeping busy.”","‘Designed to humiliate’: Israel’s torture of Gaza’s healthcare workers","2025-07-14T21:55:02.185858Z"

The measure was viewed as a response to a growing concern that Israel was committing human rights violations amid its bombardment of Gaza.The memorandum was one of the few remaining Biden policies addressing the conflict. All mention of the memorandum has been scrubbed from the White House website, with searches resulting in a 404 error.A May 2024 report, mandated by the memorandum, stated that while Israel may have violated international humanitarian law, the Biden administration could not verify specific cases of civilian harm because of the ongoing war.Trump’s decision to overturn the memorandum follows moves to unfreeze heavy weapon shipments to Israel and lift sanctions on Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank.On February 7, the Trump administration approved the sale of more than $7.4bn worth of bombs, missiles, and related military equipment to Israel.The latest move effectively removes the last vestige of Biden’s policies on the Gaza war, which has killed at least 48,346 and left more than 111,759 others wounded.Senator Chris Van Hollen, a prominent advocate for the memorandum, condemned the move to scrap it, calling it “shameful” and a blow to global human rights and US national security and its standing around the world.He added that the reversal undermines the ability of taxpayers to ensure their money aligns with US laws and values.“This is another clear example of Trump’s blatant indifference to American values,” he stated.US Senator Jim Risch, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, welcomed the move.He criticised the original order as a political manoeuvre “conceived of as a means to embarrass our ally Israel in its time of need”, arguing that the policy had weakened US alliances while benefitting rivals such as Russia and China.","US scraps order linking arms sales to international law","2025-07-15T19:40:26.138698Z"

He will be able to visit Germany,” he added.In an earlier statement, Netanyahu’s office said Merz had invited the Israeli prime minister “to make an official visit to Germany, in overt defiance of the scandalous International Criminal Court decision to label the Prime Minister a war criminal”.In November, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant as well as Hamas commander Mohammed Deif on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.Both Israel and Hamas say Deif was killed in July in an Israeli air strike.The ICC, which is based in The Hague, Netherlands, responded to Herz’s remarks on Monday, saying that states have a legal obligation to enforce its decisions.Any concerns countries may have should be addressed with the court in a timely and efficient manner, the court added.“It is not for states to unilaterally determine the soundness of the court’s legal decisions.”Israel has condemned the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, saying that it has acted in self-defence against Hamas’s October 2023 attacks on Israel.But human rights groups and international law experts have accused Israel of committing war crimes and indiscriminately bombing Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, which has been destroyed in 15 months of war.More than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. But thousands more have been reported missing under the rubble and are presumed dead.There are “reasonable grounds” to believe that Gallant and Netanyahu “intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity”, the ICC said in its November decision.The Rome Statute, the treaty that established the ICC, includes 124 state parties across six continents.Under the statute, countries that are part of the ICC are legally bound to enforce its arrest warrants, international human rights lawyer Jonathan Kuttab told Al Jazeera after the warrants were issued last year.“The law operates on the basis of a presumption that people will obey it. That’s how all laws are created,” Kuttab said. “You expect everybody to respect the law. Those who don’t respect the law are themselves violating the law.”Germany has been both a staunch ally of Israel and a strong backer of the ICC.As a member state of the court, the country is required to detain suspects facing arrest warrants if they set foot on their soil, but the ICC has no way to enforce that.After the ICC’s decision in November, a German government spokesperson said the country would “carefully examine” the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant but would not take further steps until a visit to the country.“The federal government was involved in the drafting of the ICC statute and is one of the ICC’s biggest supporters. This position is also a result of German history,” the spokesperson said.“At the same time, a consequence of German history is that we have a unique relationship and a great responsibility to Israel.”","Merz says Netanyahu will be able to visit Germany despite ICC warrant","2025-07-15T17:47:05.641483Z"

Our Shiri was murdered in captivity and has now returned home to her sons, husband, sister, and all her family to rest,” the Bibas family said in a statement published on Saturday.The family, however, said that the Israeli government provided no details as to the circumstances that led to the deaths of Bibas and her two young sons, Kfir and Ariel.Hamas had agreed to hand over the bodies of Bibas and her two young sons along with the remains of a fourth captive on Thursday under a ceasefire that has halted fighting in Gaza since last month.Hamas said the children and their mother were killed in an Israeli air attack in November 2023.Four bodies were delivered, but Israel later said one of the remains did not belong to the elder Bibas.On Friday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to “ensure that Hamas pays the full price” for what he described as a “violation” of the ceasefire deal.Hamas later admitted “the possibility of an error or mix-up of bodies”, which it attributed to Israeli bombing of the area that had killed several people.Basem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau, said “unfortunate mistakes” could occur, especially as Israeli bombing had mixed the bodies of Israeli captives and Palestinians, thousands of whom were still buried under the rubble due to relentless Israeli bombardments.“We confirm that it is not in our values or our interest to keep any bodies or not to abide by the covenants and agreements that we sign,” he said in a statement.Ismail al-Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run Gaza Government Media Office, said Netanyahu “bears full responsibility for killing her and her children”.The incident underscored the fragility of the ceasefire deal reached with United States backing and with the help of Qatari and Egyptian mediators last month.Six living captives are due for release on Saturday in exchange for 602 Palestinians in Israeli prison, most of whom have been detained without charge or trial.

At the same time, Sanad also identified at least six homes razed in Tal as-Sultan, west of Rafah, a little more than 750 metres (820 yards) from the Egyptian border.“This is a war crime because they are destroying residential houses,” Attar said, referring to the fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits the destruction of private property.Meanwhile, Munir al-Bursh, director-general of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said on Tuesday that Israeli attacks, unexploded ordnance, or fatal injuries sustained earlier have killed 118 people since the ceasefire agreement took effect.In addition to military breaches of the ceasefire, Israel has not allowed in sufficient amounts of essential humanitarian aid, such as food, fuel, tents, and emergency shelters.Rafah Mayor Ahmed al-Sufi said most of the city’s residents remain displaced, with an estimated 200,000 people sheltering in the al-Mawasi Khan Younis area and other locations across Gaza, unable to come home.According to him, initial estimates indicate that 90 percent of Rafah’s homes have been damaged, with approximately 52,000 units suffering various degrees of destruction.","Despite ceasefire, Israel still destroying homes in Gaza","2025-06-28T09:05:35.951128Z"

Instead, it would be up to regional countries and the international community to implement any plan put forward by Egypt and Jordan.“One can speculate that, definitely, [this plan] will involve enlisting massive amounts of cash and finances from the Gulf … to speed up the reconstruction process for the Palestinians without displacing them,” El-Hamalawy said.Egyptian construction companies do appear ready to cooperate with an international effort to rebuild Gaza. For instance, real estate and construction tycoon Hisham Talaat Moustafa, said in a TV interview on February 9 that he has been working on a reconstruction plan that would require the participation of about 40 to 50 construction companies from Egypt and other countries.“Egypt could contribute to reconstruction efforts while simultaneously guaranteeing that Gazans don’t need to be forced out,” Nasef said, adding that “They won’t have to if caravans and tents, which Israel continues to block, are allowed into the Strip.” He agreed with El-Hamalawy, though, that Egypt’s efforts would have to be bankrolled by the Gulf, due to Egypt’s economic problems.Gulf countries have played a significant role in funding the aid reaching the Gaza Strip in the last few months, with the Gulf Cooperation Council announcing in December that its member states – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates – had collectively given $650m in humanitarian aid to Gaza, along with the occupied West Bank, since October 2023.The reconstruction of Gaza, where the vast majority of buildings and infrastructure has been destroyed by Israel, will cost far more.But with Trump’s Gaza displacement plan complicating matters and a ceasefire deal in Gaza that has threatened to collapse in the past week, Arab countries are under pressure to respond.","Trump’s Gaza takeover ‘plan’ puts Egypt in a tough spot","2025-07-14T21:33:07.007920Z"

No injuries have been reported so far.The Jenin refugee camp, set up in 1953 by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) to accommodate displaced Palestinians, is a hub for Palestinian resistance groups operating under the umbrella of the Jenin Brigades and has long been a focal point for Israeli military incursions.On Thursday, the Israeli army also said it had detained more than 90 Palestinians this week across the occupied West Bank.The Palestinian Prisoner’s Society (PPS) said at least 380 people have been arrested by Israeli forces since the start of their large-scale military operations in the occupied West Bank after the Gaza ceasefire went into effect on January 19.At least 150 Palestinians have been arrested in Jenin over the past 24 days with at least 125 taken in by Israeli soldiers during an 18-day siege of Tulkarem, according to the PPS. It recorded at least 100 arrests in Tubas over 17 days.Reporting from Amman, Jordan, Al Jazeera’s Nour Odeh said that the Israeli army is digging deeper in Jenin and Tulkarem by continuing nightly raids.“What we have been hearing from official sources in Tulkarem, for example, is that this onslaught resulted in the displacement of 85 percent of the residents of its refugee camp, and of a significant portion of the Jenin refugee camp which is now almost unrecognisable in some areas,” she said.“This mass displacement is happening while Israeli military officials are saying that their plan is to completely change the geography of the camp, and that there will be some areas where return will simply not be possible because they will be torn down.”On Thursday, the Israeli army also killed a young Palestinian man and arrested his brother in Ramallah.“The young man Issa Riyad Jabali was 28 years old and was killed by the occupation forces’ bullets near the town of Huwara, on the pretext of carrying out an operation,” the Palestinian Health Ministry said.A group of Israeli settlers also stormed the village of al-Awsaj, north of Jericho, kidnapped a Palestinian man and took him to an unknown location, according to Eid Brahma, the director of the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society in Jericho and the Jordan Valley.Israeli forces also arrested a Palestinian man from al-Jiftlik north of Jericho while he was herding sheep.Soldiers present at the King Hussein (Allenby) Bridge crossing also detained a high school student from the city of Bethlehem while he was returning from Jordan.Since October 7, 2023, at least 915 Palestinians, including 182 children and minors, have been killed and more than 7,616 wounded by Israeli army and settler attacks.

The AFP news agency shared images showing a row of bulldozers on the Egyptian side of the border.However, Israel later said they would not be allowed to enter through the crossing.“There is no entry of caravans or heavy equipment into the Gaza Strip, and there is no coordination for this,” Omer Dostri, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wrote on X, adding: “No goods are allowed to enter the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing.”Hamas has previously accused Israel of holding up the delivery of heavy machinery needed to clear the vast amounts of rubble across the enclave.United States President Donald Trump had warned this week that “hell” would break loose if Hamas failed to release “all” the remaining captives by noon (10:00 GMT) on Saturday.If fighting resumes, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said: “The new Gaza war … will not end without the defeat of Hamas and the release of all the hostages.”“It will also allow the realisation of US President Trump’s vision for Gaza,” he added.Trump, whose return to the White House has emboldened the Israeli far right, caused a global outcry over his proposal for the US to take over the Gaza Strip and move its 2.3 million residents to Egypt or Jordan.The Gaza truce, currently in its first phase, has seen Israeli captives released in small groups in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli custody.","Hamas says three captives to be released amid ceasefire deal collapse fears","2025-06-28T10:39:13.561805Z"

The army also deployed tear gas and sound bombs against a number of students in al-Khader, south of Bethlehem, causing them to suffer suffocation-related injuries.Israeli forces stormed Aqqaba town, north of Tubas, arresting two men. They also destroyed agricultural land with bulldozers in Funduq village, east of Qalqilya, and raided homes close to occupied East Jerusalem.Land-rights analyst Zubiedat stressed that Israel’s assault goes beyond the camps, with Israel building “new walls” around Palestinian villages in the Jordan Valley, “isolating whole Palestinian communities” from the West Bank cities.“We are not only talking about the daily scenes in the refugee camps of Jenin, Nur Shams and Tulkarem, but there is also the other hidden war,” he said. “The real goal of this operation is going beyond even the military goals.”UNICEF, the UN agency for children, issued a statement on Wednesday, said 13 children have been killed in the West Bank this year, adding that “there has been a 200 per cent increase in the number of Palestinian children killed in the territory over the past 16 months as compared to the 16 months prior”.“UNICEF condemns all acts of violence against children and calls for the immediate cessation of armed activity across the occupied West Bank.

It said its military forces are ready to take any action necessary after a US Navy fast-attack nuclear submarine docked in a port in the South Korean city of Busan.North Korea’s Ministry of Defence described the presence of the US nuclear submarine on the Korean Peninsula as a “clear expression of the US invariable hysteria for confrontation”.","North Korea condemns Trump’s Gaza takeover plan as ‘slaughter, robbery’","2025-07-14T21:44:42.477131Z"

Israel has threatened — on the back of remarks from Trump himself — to restart bombing on Saturday if the Palestinian group Hamas does not release all captives by Saturday.But Abdullah avoided directly contradicting Trump during their meeting, alluding instead to an alternative plan soon to be revealed by Egypt.Here are some of the key takeaways from the meeting between Abdullah and Trump.Inside the Oval Office, journalists asked Trump about his comments that the US would take over Gaza and that the Palestinians living there would be moved elsewhere, with no right of return.He was direct in his responses, seemingly deaf to the incredulous nature of some of the questions. Yes, the US would take control of Gaza and rebuild it. Yes, the Palestinians who have been living there for generations — many of them already refugees from what is now Israel — would move to “parcels of land” in Jordan and Egypt.“We’re going to take it. We’re going to hold it. We’re going to cherish it. We’re going to get it going eventually where a lot of jobs are going to be created for the people in the Middle East,” Trump said, without giving specifics.Trump also doubled down on his threats that the ceasefire with Israel would end if Hamas’s leaders do not release the remaining Israeli captives held in the enclave over the next four days.“I don’t think they’re going to make the deadline, personally,” Trump said. “They want to play tough guy. We’ll see how tough they are.”He added that he would not accept a slower timeline: “They either have them out by Saturday at 12 o’clock or all bets are off.”Trump had announced that deadline a day earlier, in seemingly off-the-cuff comments with reporters.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has since echoed Trump’s threats, warning that his military — which has already killed more than 61,700 Palestinians since 2023 — would recommence its bombing campaign in Gaza if the Israeli captives were not released.One issue Trump did seem to back down on, at least in front of Abdullah and the cameras, was his threat that aid could be withheld from Jordan and Egypt if they do not agree to his Gaza displacement plan.“I don’t have to threaten that,” Trump said. “I do believe we’re above that.”In meeting with Trump, the Jordanian monarch was confronting a difficult task: How was he going to reiterate his country’s opposition to Trump’s Gaza plan without offending a president not known for his tolerance for dissent?In the end, Abdullah chose to avoid speaking too much in front of the media, and when he did, his language was careful, precise and designed to avoid offence.When asked whether Jordan would take in Palestinians displaced from Gaza, the Jordanian leader said he would do what was “best” for his country.In social media posts after the meeting, he said that Jordan was “steadfast” in its “position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank”.He added that Arab states would come up with their own plan for Gaza, which would be presented after it was finalised. He also flattered Trump, saying: “I finally see somebody that can take us across the finish line to bring stability, peace and prosperity to all of us in the region.”After the meeting, Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi also said that there is an Arab plan to rebuild Gaza without displacing its people.Some observers believe that Trump’s Gaza plan is a negotiating tactic and that Arab states will be able to come up with a counteroffer.The US president, of course, has his roots in the real estate business.Much of Trump’s money comes from the real estate empire he inherited from his father, and he has since leveraged his family name to license eponymous products, as well as host a reality TV show.Some of those real estate leanings, however, bled into the language he has used when describing his Gaza plan on Tuesday.“I’ve had a great career in real estate,” Trump said nostalgically. “When you’ve done what I’ve done, you can just do more good for people when you’re president.”Trump described Gaza as potentially becoming a “diamond” in the Middle East. However, when asked on Tuesday if he would consider purchasing Gaza as part of his takeover plan, Trump was dismissive.“We’re not going to buy. There’s nothing to buy,” Trump said. “We will have Gaza. No reason to buy. It’s Gaza. It’s a war-torn area.”Critics say his vision for Gaza — redeveloped with hotels, offices and a “riviera” atmosphere — seems divorced from the politics of the region. Palestinians have long withstood pressures to force them from their remaining land, despite decades of continued Israeli occupation.On Tuesday, Trump once again emphasised that Palestinians would not want to stay in Gaza, seemingly ignoring their attachment to their land.That nationalism was most recently seen when hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians used the ceasefire to return to northern Gaza, even if most of their homes had been destroyed by Israel.

In fact, any attempt at welcoming home the prisoners was explicitly banned by Israel.In an incident highlighting the tensions, Israeli army launched a retaliatory operation just one day after the release of Ashraf Zghair, a 46-year-old Palestinian who had been imprisoned since the age of 23 and was serving six life sentences.When neighbours and family members openly celebrated Zghair’s release on Saturday, January 25, authorities arrested his brother Amir, a father of four.Mounir Zghair, the official spokesperson for the Jerusalem Prisoners of War Association and Ashraf’s father, condemned the arrest in an interview.“The arrest of my son has no legal basis,” he said. “We were not officially informed about what rules we were supposedly violating.”This incident epitomises the broader pattern of restrictions imposed on Palestinian prisoners and their families. One family, speaking on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation, revealed the extent of these limitations“We are not allowed to host reception parties or distribute sweets,” the family told Al Jazeera. “The released detainees are also banned from speaking to any form of media under the threat of re-arrest. It’s the occupation’s way of restricting prisoners’ freedom even after their release.”Israel has framed the release of Palestinian prisoners as a necessary evil and brokered through an agreement with a “terrorist organisation”. It therefore considers any celebration of their release to be support for “terrorism”.“The consequences of celebrating are many, including the arrest of released prisoners’ family members for supporting a terror organisation, as in the case of Ashraf Zghair’s brother, who was arrested for welcoming his released brother with ‘green flags’,” said Mohamed Mahmoud, a lawyer who works on Palestinian prisoner cases. Hamas’s flag is green, but so are many other flags representing Palestinian groups or Islamic causes.The ceasefire’s future is currently uncertain. Hamas said on Monday that it would suspend the release of captives scheduled for Saturday because of Israeli violations of the agreement. Israel has responded by threatening to restart the bombing of Gaza if the captives are not released.Much of the focus in the days prior to Hamas’s announcement was on the condition the three Israeli captives released from Gaza on Saturday were in – all appearing emaciated. However, there has been little focus on the large number of Palestinian prisoners emerging from Israeli jails in similar states, many of whom have been taken to hospital.One of the Palestinians released in late January was 18-year-old Adam al-Hadra, who had been detained from the occupied West Bank in November 2023.“When I found out that I was included in the deal, I came back to life. It was an indescribable feeling. What hurt the most was being away from my family, not to mention the humiliation, hunger, and illness we suffered in occupation prisons,” he told Al Jazeera.However, al-Hadra’s freedom came with immediate restrictions. Within days of his release, he was prohibited from entering the Old City of Jerusalem – “one more way the occupation imposes its authority on Palestinians”, he noted. Al-Hadra’s lawyer told Al Jazeera that no reason was given by the Israeli authorities for the restrictions.Many of the Palestinians arrested are liable to be re-arrested by Israel, and many who were involved in previous exchanges have been.Legal expert Nadia Daqqa highlighted significant concerns about the release process.“The prisoners were released without providing any legal documents explaining the framework of their release,” she explained. “This poses a major problem because Israeli law now allows the government to re-arrest prisoners as soon as the political or security interest ends.”This keeps the prisoners in a “legal limbo”, Daqqa emphasised, adding that the lack of documentation may limit lawyers’ ability to protect and defend them in case they are re-arrested.While al-Hadra had been sentenced to three years in prison, thousands of Palestinians are also held by Israel in what is called “administrative detention”, a process by which Israel holds detainees without charge. Previously, a far smaller number of Israelis were also held in administrative detention, but the Israeli government has now openly stated that it will only be applied to Palestinians.Qassem Jaafra, another 18-year-old among those released in late January, was among those held in administrative detention.“I was only told half an hour before my release,” he said. “I was missing my family, friends, and school, but it also hurt to leave my close friends behind in prison.”According to the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem, more than 3,300 Palestinians are currently in administrative detention.A report by the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor published earlier this month provided a scathing critique of the detention system.It concluded that Israeli prisons and detention centres constitute a “systematic framework inherently aimed at torturing and mistreating Palestinian prisoners and detainees, while depriving them of their most basic human rights”.The report further argued that the systematic mistreatment of Palestinians is made possible by the long history of impunity Israel enjoys from the United States and European governments, representing a grave violation of international detention standards.But despite the overwhelming challenges, hope persists.As Al-Hadra concludes: “After hardship comes ease.”This article is published in collaboration with Egab.","Joy in Israel, restrictions in Palestine for released captives, prisoners","2025-06-28T10:44:14.676755Z"

It said it would limit attacks after Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire deal aimed at ending the war last month.But the fragile deal, still in the first of three phases, is looking increasingly shaky amid Israel’s repeated violations of its terms.The first phase of the deal involves captive swaps, a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops and a surge of aid into the enclave. The second phase, the details of which have not yet been agreed to, would bring about a complete end to the war. An eventual third phase is meant to address reconstruction in the devastated Palestinian enclave.On Monday, Hamas said that it would stop releasing Israeli captives over the violations, which include killings, restrictions on allowing wounded people to leave Gaza for treatment, and a failure to allow in sufficient aid. The group said it would continue to honour the terms of the agreement if Israel comes into compliance.The situation spiralled further, with US President Donald Trump saying that if Hamas did not release all Israeli captives by noon on Saturday, he would propose cancelling the truce and “let hell break out”.Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri responded to Trump’s comments, underlining that the ceasefire had to be respected by both parties. “The language of threats has no value and only complicates matters,” he said.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated Trump’s threat, saying in a video statement that the military would “return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated”.Speaking after a four-hour cabinet meeting, the Israeli leader also said he had ordered Israeli troops to gather “inside and around the Gaza Strip”.Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz had already instructed the military to be at the highest level of readiness in Gaza.To date, Gaza’s Health Ministry has said 48,219 Palestinians have been confirmed dead in the war, which has decimated the enclave’s infrastructure, displaced the vast majority of the population, and left hundreds of thousands on the brink of humanitarian catastrophe.","Yemen’s Houthis warn they are ready to attack Israel if Gaza war resumes","2025-06-28T09:59:35.456563Z"

Trump has emphasised that, to his mind, the Palestinians would not return, making his ideas ethnic cleansing.Jordan rejects the idea.Trump’s comments were condemned not only by Jordan but also Egypt, which Trump also said should “take” Palestinians from Gaza, as well as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.However, Trump said US financial support for Jordan and Egypt would force their hand.“If they don’t agree, I would conceivably withhold aid,” Trump said on Monday, the day before meeting King Abdullah.US financial backing for Jordan is important – the country was the fourth-highest recipient of US foreign aid in 2023, with $1.72bn. But accepting the uprooting of millions of Palestinians from Gaza would be a political non-starter for Amman, according to analysts.“Accepting another wave of Palestinians into the country remains a red line,” Dima Toukan, a non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute, told Al Jazeera. “The king will not budge on this matter.”King Abdullah, a longtime US ally, has been under pressure internationally and domestically since the beginning of Israel’s war on Gaza in October 2023.Jordan’s position as a key regional ally to the US and a trade partner with Israel has angered its overwhelmingly pro-Palestinian population, which also includes at least 2 million Palestinian refugees and Jordanians of Palestinian origin.Any acceptance of Trump’s ideas, which have been likened to the Nakba in which 750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed by Zionist gangs to declare the state of Israel in 1948, would be a recipe for domestic unrest and challenge the monarchy’s legitimacy.Protests against Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 61,700 Palestinians, have taken place in Amman for much of the last 16 months.While they have calmed since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Jordanians took to the streets again on Friday to protest against the idea of Trump displacing Palestinians from Gaza into Jordan.“Jordanians were clear with their messages during protests on Friday,” Toukan said.Anger can quickly lead to instability: An attack in September by a Jordanian killed three Israeli border guards.“My sense is that the king is conveying a very urgent message that Trump’s disastrous ‘plan’ is effectively going to destroy Jordan,” Sean Yom, an associate professor of political science at Temple University, said.“The displacement/relocation idea broaches the existential fear of all Jordanians – across the board, from monarchy to society – that Israel will annex all of Palestine, and that resource-poor, socially-restive Jordan will be left picking up the pieces.”But Jordan has to weigh up other considerations when it comes to Trump’s comments.Even before Israel’s war on Gaza, the monarchy was under pressure due to economic struggles that led to disenchantment among some of the country’s influential tribes.Jordan is already getting a taste of Trump’s potential to upend decades of financial assistance after he announced on the day of his inauguration that most of the US’s global aid commitments would be frozen for 90 days.Some Jordanians say they lost work or had their businesses impacted by Trump’s decision. It is also notable that while Egypt and Israel were given exceptions on the foreign aid freeze, Jordan’s position as a staunch regional ally did not protect it.“Jordan is directly dependent upon US aid and security assistance,” Yom said. “The kingdom is vulnerable to geopolitical blackmail.”Ever since Jordan and Israel signed the 1994 Wadi Araba peace agreement, the Hashemite Kingdom has been a key ally of the US with support for it often crossing administrations and party lines.But Trump’s pressure may force Jordan and other regional allies to start hedging their bets, analysts said.Jordan, Egypt and other Gulf states “are probably looking to Russia and China”, Geoffrey Hughes, author of the book Kinship, Islam and the Politics of Marriage in Jordan: Affection and Mercy, told Al Jazeera.“A lot will hinge on how much that scares the Trump administration and how credible any threat of defection or hedging seems in light of the signals coming out of Moscow and Beijing.”To continue operating as usual, Jordan would have to find enough funding from foreign powers to fill a billion-dollar gap. Analysts said the prospect of the full amount being covered was unlikely.But Jordan may have one more means of leverage.“The biggest thing to watch is the stationing of US forces in Jordan,” Hughes said.There are about 3,000 US troops in Jordan, largely focused on countering ISIL (ISIS) in recent years, part of a wider network of US troops ostensibly built up to counter ISIL over the last decade, with other troops stationed in Syria and Iraq.And yet, with Trump in power, even that leverage may not be as important as it once seemed.The US president has split from his predecessors, who placed importance on a US presence in the region, speaking about pulling US troops from Syria and Iraq.Trump reiterated the intention to pull US troops from Syria in late January, leaving some to wonder if a US presence in Jordan would be a priority.It could also alter the Jordan-Israel relationship, giving Israel an excuse to intervene directly with perceived “security threats” inside Jordanian territory.“Maybe Trump doesn’t even want [US troops in Jordan] … they also complicate any Israeli aggression that could be forthcoming,” said Hughes.","As Jordan’s King Abdullah meets Trump, can he resist US pressure on Gaza?","2025-06-28T10:57:45.441943Z"

United States President Donald Trump suggested the agreement should be ripped up unless all the Israeli captives are released by the weekend.Israel and Hamas are in the middle of a six-week ceasefire during which Hamas is releasing dozens of the captives taken during its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.However, Abu Obeida said that Israel had violated multiple parts of the truce, which was brokered between the two sides over many months.“Over the past three weeks, the resistance leadership monitored the enemy’s violations and their non-compliance with the terms of the agreement,” he said.“These violations include delaying the return of displaced persons to northern Gaza, targeting them with shelling and gunfire in various areas of the Gaza Strip, and failing to allow the entry of relief materials in all forms as agreed upon. Meanwhile, the resistance has fulfilled all its obligations.”The Qassam Brigades spokesperson reaffirmed the group’s “commitment to the terms of the agreement as long as the occupation adheres to them”.Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz swiftly responded to the Hamas move, saying that the decision was in “complete violation of the ceasefire agreement”.“I have instructed [the military] to prepare at the highest level of alert for any possible scenario in Gaza,” Katz said.The two sides have carried out five swaps since the truce went into effect last month, freeing 21 Israelis and more than 730 Palestinians.The next exchange was scheduled for Saturday, releasing three Israeli captives in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.Several Palestinian civilians have been shot and killed by Israeli forces as they returned to their homes.Meanwhile, the number of wounded Palestinian patients who were evacuated out of the Strip, as well as the humanitarian aid trucks that have entered Gaza, were fewer than what had been promised in the ceasefire agreement.The Qassam Brigades’ announcement also comes in light of the latest statements made by Trump, who has raised concerns about the sustainability of the ceasefire deal.Trump has repeatedly called for ethnically cleansing Gaza, saying that the United States would take “ownership” of the territory.Trump responded to the Hamas announcement by saying the ceasefire deal should be cancelled if all the Israeli captives are now not released by Saturday.Under the ceasefire deal, the captives are set to be released in phases.Speaking in a wide-ranging session with reporters, Trump said: “If all of the hostages aren’t returned by Saturday 12 o’clock – I think it’s an appropriate time – I would say cancel it and all bets are off and let hell break out.”The US president noted that he was expressing a personal opinion and that Israel must decide for itself what it will now do.The first stage of the deal expires on March 1. The second phase, which would see the release of all captives and a permanent ceasefire, has not been finalised. The third part of the agreement is supposed to usher in a multiyear plan to reconstruct the territory.Palestinian activist and politician Mustafa Barghouti said Israel has violated the agreement in three ways: obstructing temporary housing and humanitarian aid, shooting at people in Gaza and backing Trump’s plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza.“More than that, now Netanyahu is threatening to go back to the war, and he’s declaring that he will never stop the war,” Barghouti told Al Jazeera.“So what do they want – to get back all Israeli prisoners and then continue the massacres in Gaza? This is exactly the message that Palestinians were getting.”Netanyahu reiterated last week that he is committed to fulfilling the aims of the war, including destroying Hamas’s military and governing capabilities.Before Abu Obeida’s statement on Monday, Senior Hamas official Basem Naim told Al Jazeera that Israel has not been fulfilling its obligations under the agreement.“In the last three weeks after signing the deal we have been in very serious talks and negotiations with the mediators – the Egyptians, the Qataris, and the United States – about the daily violations by the Israelis, of the deal,” Naim said.He noted that 25 Palestinians had been killed and dozens wounded by Israeli forces after the ceasefire went into effect.","Fears for ceasefire after Hamas suspends release of Israeli captives","2025-06-28T10:01:54.385527Z"

I think I could make a deal with Egypt. You know, we give them billions and billions of dollars a year,” the US president said.He added that Palestinians would live in “beautiful communities” away from Gaza. “In the meantime, I would own this. Think of it as a real estate development for the future,” he said.The plan for the US to take over Gaza has raised eyebrows across the world. Washington has no legal claim to the territory, and the United Nations charter prohibits the acquisition of land by force.According to the Health Ministry in Gaza, Israel’s US-backed war on the enclave has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians. The Gaza Government Media Office puts the death toll at more than 61,700, including thousands of missing people who are presumed dead.The Israeli offensive has turned much of Gaza into rubble. But the territory’s residents have pledged to remain steadfast in their land.Local authorities have been pleading for tents and mobile homes to shelter people until reconstruction begins, accusing Israel of hindering the aid in violation of the ceasefire agreement.Last week, Amnesty International warned that systemic efforts to expel Palestinians in Gaza could constitute a crime against humanity.“Amnesty International also warns against the misuse of desperately needed humanitarian aid and reconstruction as a bargaining chip or as a means to coerce Palestinians in Gaza into leaving,” the group’s chief Agnes Callamard said in a statement.“No state is entitled to treat a protected population living under occupation as pawns in a geopolitical chess game.”In 1994, UN experts defined ethnic cleansing as “a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas”.","Trump says no right of return for Palestinians under his Gaza proposal","2025-07-15T20:41:48.944729Z"

There’s nothing to move back into. The place is a demolition site.”Trump also claimed that displaced Palestinians would prefer not to return to Gaza despite his proposal prompting backlash from Palestinian representatives and much of the international community.“If we could give them a home in a safer area – the only reason they’re talking about returning to Gaza is they don’t have an alternative. When they have an alternative, they don’t want to return to Gaza,” the US president said.Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, reiterated its opposition to Trump’s proposal on Sunday, calling his latest remarks “absurd”.“Gaza is not a property that can be bought and sold, and it is an integral part of our occupied Palestinian land,” Izzat al-Risheq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, said in a statement shared on Telegram.“Dealing with the Palestinian issue with the mentality of a real estate dealer is a recipe for failure,” al-Risheq added.“Our Palestinian people will thwart all displacement and deportation plans. Gaza belongs to its people.”Earlier on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump’s proposal as “revolutionary” and “creative” while addressing a cabinet meeting held hours after his return from Washington, DC, where he held talks with the US president.Trump stunned Palestinians and the international community on Tuesday by proposing that Washington take over Gaza as part of an audacious redevelopment plan that he claimed could transform the enclave into “the Riviera of the Middle East”.The US president doubled down on his suggestion the following day, after officials from his administration attempted to dampen blowback to the proposal by insisting that any resettlement of Palestinians would be temporary.Trump, a real estate developer before entering politics, has provided few details about how he would implement his proposal, which would face huge practical hurdles in addition to raising legal and ethical concerns.After initially saying he was open to the possibility of sending the US military into Gaza, Trump later said that no American soldiers would be needed to carry out the plan.Neighbouring states such as Egypt and Jordan have roundly rejected calls to take in displaced Palestinians despite Trump’s suggestion that they could be resettled in “other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts”.On Sunday, Saudi Arabia condemned a suggestion by Netanyahu that the kingdom’s land be used to establish a Palestinian state.“The kingdom affirms that the Palestinian people have a right to their land, and they are not intruders or immigrants to it who can be expelled whenever the brutal Israeli occupation wishes,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement, accusing the Israeli leader of attempting to “divert attention” from Israel’s ongoing “crimes” in Gaza.","US committed to ‘buying and owning’ Gaza, Trump says","2025-06-28T09:52:17.822444Z"

According to the ceasefire agreement, the deadline for withdrawal was February 9.The full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the corridor took place a day after Hamas and Israel conducted their fifth captive-prisoner swap, which saw the Palestinian group release three Israeli captives in exchange for 183 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.It also comes on the same day Israel sent a delegation to Qatar for talks ahead of the second phase of the ceasefire deal, according to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. The first phase of the ceasefire began on January 19 and is set to last for at least six weeks.But a source in Netanyahu’s office told Reuters that the delegation would only discuss technical issues, rather than more complicated issues such as Gaza’s post-war administration.In a statement, Hamas said Israel’s complete withdrawal from the Netzarim corridor signals a “continuation of the failure of the goals of the war of extermination against the Palestinian people”.It said the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes and the continuation of the exchange of captives and prisoners refutes Netanyahu’s “lie” about achieving victory in the 15-month war on the enclave.“Gaza will remain a land liberated by the hands of its people and its fighters, and forbidden to the occupying invaders and any external force,” it said.Israel created the corridor at the beginning of its war on Gaza. It is a closed-off military zone that stretches from Israel’s boundary with Gaza to the Mediterranean Sea and is about 6km (3.7 miles) wide.The corridor was named after Netzarim, the last Israeli settlement to be closed in Gaza in 2005, under the then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon’s plan for Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.Reporting from Doha, Qatar, Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker said the corridor was a strategic Israeli military move – giving it access, control and oversight.“For Palestinians, it was yet another land grab – a corridor of suffocation, attacks and death. The Israeli army has been accused of shooting and killing indiscriminately anyone who dared to come near,” she said.“Israeli media have quoted soldiers saying they feel that withdrawing is a failure – leaving behind the corridor that had become a symbol of their power, their control, and their victory,” she added.Reporting from northern Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said the Israeli military’s withdrawal from the corridor is a hope for more free movement for people in the enclave.“It will be very difficult for people who were displaced from this area to return to their homes. It’s hard to imagine where are they going to stay here other than just setting up tents here and there,” he said.“The hope is now that with the withdrawal of the Israeli military, there is more free movement, a flow of vehicles and aid trucks going all the way to the northern part of the Strip,” he added.Mouin Rabbani, a non-resident fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, told Al Jazeera the Netzarim Corridor “shouldn’t have a future” and “should disappear”.“Israel has not only occupied what they call the Netzarim Corridor, but placed numerous structures there that demonstrated their determination to maintain a permanent presence there, to have this capacity to bisect the Gaza Strip, to paralyse transportation and movement within it at will,” he said.“That has failed once again, and they are being compelled to withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor and hopefully never to return.”","Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza’s Netzarim Corridor","2025-06-24T20:31:15.926698Z"

Dozens of released Palestinians disembarked shortly afterwards in the town of Ramallah to scenes of jubilation from the waiting crowd.Seven Palestinians among those released were admitted to hospitals upon arriving in Ramallah, the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society said.Seven will be transferred to Egypt ahead of further deportation.Among the Palestinians set for release were senior Hamas figures. Iyad Abu Shakhdam, 49, was jailed for nearly 21 years over his involvement in Hamas attacks on Israel in the Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s.Jamal al-Tawil, a prominent Hamas politician in the occupied West Bank and former mayor of the village of el-Bireh, near Ramallah, spent nearly two decades in and out of Israeli detention, most recently without charge.Pictured as they were released, the trio of Israelis appeared gaunt and frail following their 16-month ordeal.“The disturbing images from the release of Ohad, Eli, and Or serve as yet another stark and painful evidence that leaves no room for doubt – there is no time to waste for the hostages! We must get them all out, down to the very last hostage. Now!” said the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in a statement.The three were swiftly handed to Israeli military and intelligence officers, according to a statement by the army, to be “escorted” to Israel by elite units.Sharabi and Ben Ami were taken from Kibbutz Be’eri, a farming community targeted by Hamas during its attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken captive. Levy was abducted from the Nova music festival.Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut said the first captive released, speaking on stage in Hebrew amid the armed Hamas fighters, called on the Israeli government to follow through with phases two and three of the deal. “The majority of the Israeli public wants this too,” she said.On Tel Aviv’s Hostage Square, Israelis waited “with bated breath”, she said. “This has become a symbolic place for family members of captives …  and for the greater Israeli public, who have been campaigning for their release and trying to put pressure on [Prime Minister] Benjamin Netanyahu … to adhere to this deal.”Overnight, the Israeli military is reported to have carried out raids across the West Bank on the family homes of some of the Palestinians set for release.The Palestinian Information Center said houses in the village of Deir Nidham, northwest of Ramallah were among the targets while “dozens” of people in the city of Qalqilya were arrested.The first 42-day phase of the ceasefire agreement, which calls for 33 Israeli captives and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners to be released, has so far held despite uproar over Trump’s proposal to clear Gaza of its inhabitants and take over the territory.So far, 18 Israeli captives and 550 Palestinian prisoners have been exchanged. But it is feared that Trump’s plan could complicate talks over the second and more difficult phase, when Hamas is to release the remaining captives in return for a lasting ceasefire.The armed group is thought to have little motivation to give up the leverage that the captives represent should there be a prospect that the US and Israel would then embark on an ethnic cleansing of the enclave.A third phase of the agreement calls for the reconstruction of Gaza, but US officials have also recently raised significant doubts over that.The first phase of the ceasefire also includes the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and an increase in humanitarian aid to the territory. Last week, wounded Palestinians were allowed to leave Gaza for Egypt for the first time since May.It is unclear whether Israel and Hamas have begun negotiating the second phase, and it is feared that the devastating war, which has killed more than 61,709 people in Gaza, a figure which now includes at least 14,222 missing and presumed dead, could resume in early March.More than 100 of the captives that Hamas took were released during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. More than 70 are still in Gaza, however, at least a third are believed to be dead.","Hamas and Israel carry out fifth prisoner swap under Gaza ceasefire deal","2025-07-15T20:41:42.605696Z"

Israeli soldiers fired stun grenades directly at the ambulance, damaging the vehicle as it was responding to an emergency, it said.For the 12th consecutive day, Israeli forces also continued their wide-scale military assault on Tulkarem city and its refugee camp in the western West Bank, causing extensive damage to infrastructure and civilian property.Over the past few days, the Israeli army has arrested dozens of Palestinians, forced hundreds of families to flee their homes and killed four Palestinians, including a child and a journalist.Israeli forces have also turned Palestinian homes in Tulkarem and its camp into military outposts after evicting their residents.Witnesses told Turkiye’s Anadolu news agency that the Israeli army carried out mass arrests in eastern Tulkarem city.Wafa reported that the Israeli army continues to besiege Thabet Thabet Governmental Hospital. It is also occupying the adjacent al-Adawiya commercial complex, having converted it into a military base and surveillance post.Tulkarem Governor Abdullah Kamil confirmed in a statement that 85 percent of the camp’s population had been displaced due to the Israeli military assault.In the northern West Bank for the sixth consecutive day, the Israeli army continued its offensive in Tammun and the Far’a refugee camp in Tubas governorate.Israeli forces have been conducting house-to-house searches in Tammun under the cover of air strikes with drone attacks targeting various locations in the town.While no casualties have been reported, residents are suffering from a severe shortage of supplies and a near-total power outage.The Israeli army has also made many arrests and conducted interrogations of Palestinians in the area.In the Far’a camp, sources reported that Israeli forces targeted infrastructure, cutting off electricity and water supplies to most residents.","Israeli army demolishes homes in Jenin, continues raids across West Bank","2025-07-15T20:36:22.726758Z"

Her eyes are red, and her voice is full of sadness.She had a husband, Abdullah, and two children, four-year-old Hamza, and two-year-old Raghad. But as she returned with hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians to northern Gaza after months of displacement in the south of the enclave, she was travelling alone.Abdullah, Hamza and Raghad were killed in an Israeli attack on August 9, as they prepared for a day trip to the beach, an attempt to escape the daily horrors of the war.Aya described a strong explosion, smoke, and then her children lying dead on the ground with blood pouring from their heads.Abdullah, who had earlier gone to buy ingredients for a cake and some snacks for the beach, was dead too.“Since that time, I have been trying to be strong. I am trying to endure the separation,” Aya said. “But everything around me reminds me of them.”Her journey back home to Gaza City’s as-Saftawi neighbourhood last week, as part of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, had many of those painful reminders. Abdullah had been desperate to go back home. He’d already set aside the clothes he would wear for the journey. She took her husband’s outfit with her on her long walk north, as well as those of her children. And she walked, alone.“Sadness was eating away at my heart,” Aya said. “Sometimes I cried. I looked at the families walking together, a mother, a father and their children. As for me, I was alone without any of them.”Aya arrived at her family’s home and reunited with her mother, but she is not sure how long the journey took. Her mind was preoccupied with the heartache of the losses that still haunt her.Soon after, she decided to go and see whatever was left of her house, which had been destroyed during the war. As she searched through the rubble for any of their old belongings to keep as memories, she found herself imagining searching for her lost loved ones, and finally finding them again.“What can I do? This is my fate.”So many of those returning to Gaza’s north have had to go through the same pain as Aya, returning home, but without their loved ones.Israel’s war on Gaza has killed more than 61,700 Palestinians, including more than 17,400 children.Jawaher Shabeer’s son, Walid, was one of those killed. They fled Gaza City together at the start of the war, moving to Rafah, in the far south of the Strip.Walid was Jawaher’s eldest son. He was 26 and “dutiful and affectionate”. It was that love for his mother and his family that led to Walid leaving the family’s tent in Rafah at the end of Ramadan in April last year, trying to find work to alleviate the famine-like conditions the family were living through.“He found work with one of his friends near Khan Younis,” Jawaher said. “He promised that he would return with okra to cook.”But Walid didn’t come back. Jawaher was told that he had been shot by the Israeli army in Khan Younis.The month passed heavily on Jawaher’s heart. She says she lost the ability to speak. Instead, in her mind, she pictured Walid, imagining his return.Jawaher made her own return to the north with the rest of her family. But before she left, she would make one last stop to visit Walid’s grave.“I cried over Walid,” Jawaher said. “How would I go back without him? How will I meet my daughters and granddaughters in Gaza City without Walid, that kind young man, that companion of mine.”","Palestinians return home in Gaza, but without their loved ones","2025-06-28T10:06:49.352645Z"

The US is also currently not an elected member of the council.On Thursday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar accused the UNHRC of anti-Semitism and said his country “joins the United States and will not participate in the UNHRC”.Saar added that the decision “was reached in light of the ongoing and unrelenting institutional bias against Israel in the Human Rights Council, which has been persistent since its inception in 2006”.Earlier, Israel’s UN ambassador, Danny Danon, accused the body of “moral failure”.Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, said Israel’s decision was “extremely serious” and “shows the hubris and the lack of realisation of what they [Israel] have done”.“They insist in self-righteousness that they have nothing to be held accountable for, and they are proving it to the entire international community,”  she added.The UNHRC conducts periodic reviews of the human rights records of UN member states and is also responsible for appointing human rights experts to serve as independent UN special rapporteurs.Israel has participated in periodic reviews that UN members must submit to the UNHRC.

The US, working with great development teams from all over the World, would slowly and carefully begin the construction of what would become one of the greatest and most spectacular developments of its kind on Earth,” Trump said on his platform, Truth Social.“No soldiers by the US would be needed! Stability for the region would reign!!!”Earlier on Thursday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz announced that he had ordered the military to draw up a plan to allow Gaza residents to leave the enclave if they wish to do so.Katz welcomed Trump’s “bold initiative” for Gaza, saying it could “create extensive opportunities for those in Gaza who wish to leave” and “support long-term reconstruction efforts in a demilitarized, threat-free Gaza after Hamas – an effort that will take many years”.Trump’s bombshell announcement on Tuesday that the US would “take over” and “own” Gaza stunned Palestinians and the international community, prompting widespread condemnation and casting the talks to extend the fragile truce between Israel and Hamas into doubt.“The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it, too. We’ll own it,” Trump said after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday sought to walk back Trump’s suggestion that Palestinians in Gaza would be “permanently” resettled in neighbouring countries, saying the idea was for them to leave the territory during an “interim” period of reconstruction and debris-clearing.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also attempted to clarify Trump’s comments, saying the administration expected Egypt, Jordan and other countries in the region to accept Palestinians “temporarily so that we can rebuild their home”.“It’s a demolition site right now. It’s not a livable place for any human being,” Leavitt said.The United Nations has warned that “any forced displacement of people would be tantamount to ethnic cleansing”.In a speech to a UN committee that deals with the rights of Palestinians, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday that “the exercise of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people is about the right of Palestinians to simply live as human beings in their own land”.Trump’s proposals have been rejected by Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, and numerous countries, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Turkiye, China, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Spain.“Gaza is the Gaza of Palestinians, an integral part of the Palestinian territory, not a political bargaining chip, let alone the target of a law of the jungle,” Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Thursday.Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Jordan’s King Abdullah II said the plan “would be a serious violation of international law, an obstacle to the two-state solution and a major destabilising force” for their countries.Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the kingdom rejected any attempts to remove Palestinians from their land in “a clear and explicit manner”.Residents in Gaza have also rejected the idea that they could be forced out of their land.Fathi Abu al-Saeed, a 72-year-old resident of Khan Younis, said he would remain right by his demolished home.“You see that pile of useless rubble?” he told Al Jazeera in an interview, raising his cane to point at a demolished house. “That’s more precious than the United States and everything in it.”More than 61,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s 15-month-long bombardment of the enclave, according to local health authorities.Negotiations are under way to extend a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel that took effect on January 19, following a deal brokered by officials from the Trump administration and that of former US President Joe Biden.","Trump doubles down on Gaza plan, says Palestinians could be ‘happy’","2025-07-14T21:31:42.611068Z"

In Trump’s comments, made as he stood next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – the man responsible for the decision to devastate Gaza in Israel’s war – the US president even said that Palestinians should move from the enclave permanently.Some of his officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, suggested on Wednesday that any departure would be temporary, although Trump’s language evoked both 19th-century colonialism and the spectre of ethnic cleansing.The 36-year-old Wasayef’s reaction is one of indifference.“I didn’t pay much attention,” she said as she made her way to check on her rain-soaked tent.“I don’t even own a mobile phone or any means of following the news,” she added indifferently, her tired face betraying her exhaustion.“What I do know is that my mother and I will never leave Gaza, no matter what happens. All we are waiting for now is a way to return to our destroyed home in the north.”Wasayef sees Trump’s statements as a form of pressure – on both the Palestinian people and armed groups in Gaza, including Hamas.“I can tell you that people here will never accept forced displacement,” she said. They can endure internal displacement, but forcing them out of their country, as Trump suggests, will never work.”Imad al-Qassas, a 60-year-old father of six, has been displaced from eastern Deir el-Balah to its centre, where he now lives in a tent after his home was destroyed.His response to Trump’s statements was clear: “That’s impossible.”“No matter how much destruction, devastation and killing we’ve endured during this war, this will never happen,” he added.“Where would we even go?” he asked. “Even if the border crossings were opened and voluntary migration was offered, I would never leave, no matter how difficult my situation is.”Imad believes that no matter the temptations of resettlement – whether houses, compensation, or host countries – a person’s ultimate refuge is their homeland.“I lived in Sudan for four years and in Libya for six years in the 1990s. I was born in the United Arab Emirates. But in the end, I returned home,” he said firmly. “No matter what calamities befall us in Gaza, this is our homeland, and we hold it sacred.”“Life outside Gaza, even under normal circumstances, is not as easy for all people around the world. Residency permits, renewals, documents – there’s always a distinction between refugees and residents,” he explained. “Now imagine our situation: displaced, rejected and forced out of Gaza. We would undoubtedly be humiliated and treated in the worst way possible.”“I would rather die where I stand. Even if they cut me and my children into pieces, I will not leave.”Tears streamed down Imad’s face as he questioned what the world wants from Palestinians in Gaza.“We are an educated and cultured people. We have the right to live on our land and see it rebuilt. We have merchants, doctors, journalists, engineers – we have lives. Why are we being forced to leave?”Like many displaced Palestinians, Imad sees Trump’s remarks as part of “a broader effort to pressure the population”, especially amid discussions on prisoner exchanges and reconstruction efforts.“I am willing to wait 100 years for the reconstruction if I have to. I will never leave, no matter what.”At the same time, Imad still blamed Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, and neighbouring countries for failing to end the war at any cost.“This was all planned long ago. The US and Israel have been plotting this for years. All parties should have shut this plan down from the start because it’s the people who are paying the price.”Unlike Imad, Khaled Maqbel, 63, and his wife Iman, 52, showed no reaction when asked about Trump’s statements.“God willing, he will be taken away,” 52-year-old Iman Maqbel muttered, turning her face away.“Since two of my daughters and two of my grandchildren were killed in an Israeli air strike during the war, I have stopped caring about anything,” she added, tears welling in her eyes.Iman fled from the as-Saftawi neighbourhood in northern Gaza to Deir el-Balah with her husband, 63-year-old Khaled, and their remaining children a year ago, enduring displacement five times since then.“We have no energy left to process anything – Trump or his statements,” said Khaled. “The people of Gaza are drowning in grief, sickness and hardship after the war. They don’t even have the capacity to think about what comes next.”The couple strongly rejected Trump’s displacement plan. “We already regret leaving the north, even though we were forced out at gunpoint. Do they really think we’ll obey Trump now?”Iman recalled how, during the war, many displaced people around her spoke of leaving Gaza if given the chance. “But that was only out of sheer desperation,” she said.“Despite everything, people in Gaza are still clinging to life on this land, even as the entire world fights against us for reasons we can’t understand,” she adds.“Even if they offered me mansions, millions, and luxurious homes, I wouldn’t leave Gaza – nor would my sons.”When asked about the timing of Trump’s statements, Khaled erupted in anger.“Timing? What timing? We are barely waking up from this war!” he said. “People are still pulling their loved ones’ bodies from the rubble. They are still cleaning their homes of debris, searching for any sign of life.”“This world has lost all sense of humanity.”In contrast, 23-year-old Mahmoud Abu Ouda, who runs a small coffee and tea stand in Deir el-Balah, says he wants to leave the Strip as soon as possible.“In the end, Trump will force us out of Gaza, just as people were forced from the north to the south during the war,” said Mahmoud.“If they open the Rafah crossing [with Egypt], a huge number of people will leave immediately. I’ll be the first to go.”For Mahmoud, the unbearable pressures of life in Gaza after the war make staying unthinkable. “This is not a life. There is no life here. After the war, there’s nothing left to keep us in this country.”Although Mahmoud wants to leave Gaza, he rejects the idea of being forced out – but he also sees no alternative.“We are always forced,” he said. “We were forced to flee from the north to the south. We endured the war against our will. We endured the bombings against our will. We have never had a choice.”“If leaving is the solution to our problems, then let’s go,” he continued.“If they prepare homes, jobs, and a real life for us, then let’s leave and put an end to the Gaza story.”Mahmoud told Al Jazeera that his views represent a significant portion of Gaza’s youth who have suffered immensely during the war.“Our future has been destroyed. I am responsible for six family members. I couldn’t finish my university degree. I work for a meagre wage all day long. Our house was bombed. We were displaced.”“Is this the life of a young man in his 20s or an old man in his 90s?” he asked desperately.“Gaza will never see peace. Gaza is dead,” he said, convinced that Trump is serious about his threats.Amir Taleb, a friend of Mahmoud’s, agreed that life in Gaza has become unbearable after the war, but opposed forced displacement or the idea of trading the right to stay in Gaza for promises of reconstruction and a better life.“Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric is pushing many of us who once considered leaving to change our minds – just to defy his plans,” the 24-year-old Amir said with a sharp smile.“No rational, self-respecting person would accept this. We are not subjugated to Trump or anyone else to be manipulated as they wish.”Amir told Al Jazeera that he had left Gaza four years ago, immigrating to Belgium with no intention of returning.“I couldn’t stay there for more than a year, despite having friends and family there,” he admitted.He returned to Gaza and opened a small clothing shop.“Living in exile is difficult, and for us in Gaza, returning is never guaranteed. We do not have the privilege of coming and going as we please. That’s why many choose to stay despite everything,” Amir added.“Arab and Islamic countries must take a stand against Trump’s schemes,” Amir said. “This is a psychological and moral war against us in every sense.”","Palestinians react with fury, resignation to Trump’s Gaza displacement plan","2025-07-15T20:38:14.881242Z"

We’ll own it,” Trump said.Netanyahu smiled as he heard Trump’s comments during their joint media conference.In recent months, Trump has also suggested that the US should take over the Panama Canal, Greenland and Canada.But his remarks on Gaza amid the immense suffering in the territory were especially jarring. It was met with rebuke from many rights campaigners.Here’s some of what Trump’s critics had to say:Abed Ayoub, executive director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), said Trump’s proposal is “terrifying”.Ayoub said the US president’s comments are “insane”, but they should not be taken lightly, stressing that it was Israel’s plan all along to ethnically cleanse Gaza.“It would go against all norms and international law. This isn’t something that would be permitted to happen,” Ayoub told Al Jazeera.“But at this point, you’ve got to ask yourself, if you look at the past year and a half: How much does the international community, including Israel, really care about international law and norms?”He warned that displacing Palestinians would ignite a major backlash in Arab countries and throw the entire region into further turmoil.Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based rights group DAWN, slammed Trump’s remarks on depopulating Gaza and the US taking over the enclave.“President Trump’s delusional comments about owning Gaza highlights the need for the international community to hold both Israeli and US leaders accountable,” Jarrar told Al Jazeera.“Doubling down on being Israel’s partner in genocide and ethnic cleansing is not just a threat to Palestine, it is a threat to world peace and international order.”Tariq Habash, who resigned from the Joe Biden administration over its unconditional support for Israel, said Trump’s plan is an “endorsement of ethnic cleansing” and a “blatant violation of international law”.“The US has no right to ‘own’ Gaza or dictate a future for the Palestinian people. This is not diplomacy and is not in America’s interest,” Habash, who recently co-founded the think tank A New Policy, told Al Jazeera.Nancy Okail, president of the Center for International Policy, said that Trump’s proposal echoes ideas from the “darkest chapters of history”.“President Trump’s comments proposing that the Gaza Strip’s population be permanently relocated and that the United States ‘take over’ the territory is nothing less than an open call for the commission of a crime against humanity,” Okail said in a statement.“It is unconscionable that a United States President would promote the forcible displacement of a population and acquisition of territory in the 21st century.”Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, called on her colleagues who say they support the two-state solution to speak up against Trump.“Palestinians aren’t going anywhere,” Tlaib wrote in a social media post.“This president can only spew this fanatical bull***t because of bipartisan support in Congress for funding genocide and ethnic cleansing.”The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) rejected Trump’s comments, saying that if the US president truly wants peace in the region he must work to end the oppression of Palestinians.“Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people, not the United States, and President Trump’s call to displace Palestinians from their land either temporarily or permanently is an absolute non-starter,” CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad said in a statement.“If the Palestinian people were ever somehow forcibly expelled from Gaza, this crime against humanity would complete the Israeli genocide of the Palestinians on their own land, spark widespread conflict, put the final nail in the coffin of international law, and permanently scar our nation’s international image.”The Arab American Institute said Trump hosted a “war criminal” at the White House for a “casual discussion” of genocide and ethnic cleansing.“This declaration will give ammunition to Iran and other adversaries while undermining our Arab partners in the region. It defies decades of bipartisan American support for a two-state solution – the only viable means to guaranteeing peace, stability, and security for both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples,” the group said in a series of social media posts.“Palestinians cannot be erased.”","‘Insane’: Rights advocates denounce Trump’s call for US to ‘own’ Gaza","2025-07-15T20:41:20.531147Z"

It is the most pressing need at this moment,” the office said in a statement.It urged the Jordan Hashemite Charity Organisation, which has been helping coordinate aid to Palestinians, to include tents alongside food and other humanitarian supplies in the coming assistance shipments.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have returned to the north of the territory after the truce reached between Israel and Hamas last month.But many found that their homes have been turned to rubble as Israel levelled entire neighbourhoods in Gaza City and northern towns like Jabalia and Beit Hanoon.The Government Media Office later accused Israel of restricting the flow of aid and shelters to the territory in violation of the ceasefire deal that went into effect on January 19.It said the agreement stipulates that 60,000 trailers and 200,000 tents must enter Gaza to help house Palestinians rendered homeless by Israeli bombing.According to the office, the deal also requires Israel to allow equipment to help clear the rubble to reach Gaza.“But the Israeli occupation is putting obstacles and delaying the execution of the agreement, escalating the humanitarian crisis and the suffering of civilians in the Gaza Strip,” it said. “This will have dangerous and unprecedented implications.”Later on Tuesday, World Food Programme official Antoine Renard said there had been a surge in aid to Gaza but suggested that some Israeli restrictions remained, including on items deemed to be “dual use” for civilian and military purposes.“This is a reminder to you that many of the items that are dual use need also to enter into Gaza like medical and also tents,” Renard was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency.United States President Donald Trump has been calling for displacing the entire population of Gaza, citing the widespread destruction in the territory.Trump’s proposal, which critics say would amount to ethnic cleansing, has been forcefully rejected by Arab states.The US president is set to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Tuesday. The meeting would come amid concerns over the durability of the ceasefire.The initial 42-day truce, which will see the release of 33 Israeli captives and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, expires on March 1.The second stage, which would see the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the freeing of all captives, has not been finalised.On Monday, Trump – who has repeatedly taken credit for helping broker the deal – said he has “no assurances” that the fighting will not resume.“I’ve seen people brutalised. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. No, I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,” he told reporters at the White House.Ofer Cassif, a member of the Israeli parliament and a vocal critic of Israel’s abuses against Palestinians, said it was “terrifying” that talks over the second stage have not begun.“I’ve been saying since day one that Netanyahu and the thugs around him in the coalition and the government are not really interested in a ceasefire or saving the Israeli hostages – let alone saving the lives of thousands of Palestinians,” he told Al Jazeera from West Jerusalem.Israel has killed nearly 62,000 Palestinians, including thousands who are missing and presumed dead, during the war that started in October 2023.","Gaza authorities plead for tents, accuse Israel of obstructing aid","2025-06-28T10:00:23.903459Z"

However, at least 14,222 people are still believed to be trapped under the rubble or in areas inaccessible to rescuers.Speaking at Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital, Salama Maarouf told reporters that among the death toll are 17,881 children, including 214 newborn infants.“More than 2 million people have been forcibly displaced, some more than 25 times, under dire conditions lacking basic services,” the official added, noting that 111,588 people have also been injured.The updated numbers come amid the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that last month halted, at least temporarily, 15 months of genocide in the enclave, which followed the assault by Hamas on southern Israel in October 2023 that saw the armed group kill about 1,200 and take 250 people back to Gaza as captives.The pause in fighting, set to continue until at least early March, has given room for Palestinian rescuers to reach parts of Gaza they could not reach before.“Humanitarian and medical teams have shifted from rescue to recovery missions,” said Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzom, reporting from Gaza’s al-Rashid Street, a route many Palestinians are taking to head back to their northern hometowns.“Hundreds of homes have become graveyards.”Maarouf also noted the heavy toll on health, humanitarian and media workers in the enclave. At least 1,155 medical personnel, 205 journalists and 194 civil defence workers are reported to have been killed during Israel’s onslaught.Negotiations are about to get under way, moving to the second stage of the three-phase ceasefire. That envisages an approach to a permanent end to the war.Mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States will open those talks today, but if they cannot bring Israel and Hamas to an agreement, fighting could resume in March.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is in Washington, DC and plans to meet President Donald Trump, is under pressure from far-right allies to cut the ceasefire short and continue fighting.Netanyahu, who alongside other Israeli officials and Hamas leaders is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, said he and Trump would discuss “victory over Hamas, achieving the release of all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian terror axis” in the Middle East.","Deaths from Israel’s attacks on Gaza close to 62,000 as missing added","2025-06-28T09:55:36.113837Z"

He cited statehood, self-determination, and the right of return for Palestinians who fled or were forced out of their homes after the Nakba in 1948 – when Israel was created on the majority of historic Palestine – or subsequent wars.This includes the Trump administration, Naim said. “If there is any chance to meet with any party, including the Trump administration, to discuss in detail how we can achieve such goals, I think there would be no veto within the movement and no objections.”“In politics, it is not about liking someone or not liking someone” Naim added, in reference to the US president. “It is about the interests of all parties.”Naim’s comments followed similar sentiments shared by Hamas’s senior official, Mousa Abu Marzouk, in an interview with The New York Times on January 20. Abu Marzouk said that the group was “prepared for a dialogue with America”, and praised Trump as “a serious president”, crediting him with ending the Israel-Hamas war.The comments appear to signal an overture by Hamas to a US administration, which they hope will deploy a more bullish approach to the conflict even as it remains staunchly pro-Israel.Naim welcomed Trump’s intervention in ceasefire talks that had languished under President Joe Biden, and expressed confidence that the agreement would hold. “We are committed to the deal and exerting maximum efforts to give this deal a chance to succeed,” he told Al Jazeera.He also noted that the strategic alliance between the US and Israel was “so strong that we haven’t witnessed any serious differences between Republicans and Democrats”.“Despite this, we still hope that the current administration can make a change and shift to a new American approach towards the Palestinian question,” he added. “If this happens, I’m sure we are ready to cooperate with any party who is ready to do it.”Naim may voice cautious optimism, but he is also concerned about Trump’s long-term plans, citing the comments about Israel’s “biblical right” to the occupied West Bank by Trump’s nominee to be US ambassador to the United Nations, Elise Stefanik, as “disappointing” and “dangerous”.He warned that the situation in the West Bank, where Israel has carried out deadly raids following the ceasefire in Gaza and settler violence has reached new levels of intensity, as extremely volatile.“We are talking about a very radical, extreme political group of people,” he said. “If nothing happens from above – and especially from the United States, from the Trump administration – on this group of people, I think it is a matter of time before we see the next explosion.”“When it comes to the current situation, change in the United States has helped in reaching a ceasefire agreement,” he added. “President Trump stated clearly that he wanted to see an end to this war before inauguration day and he exercised pressure on the situation to see an end to it.”But Trump’s apparent support for more Israeli land grabs in occupied territory and the prospect of a formal annexation of the West Bank were deeply troubling, Naim said.“When it comes to the long-term strategy… I think it is very dangerous if we are looking for stability and security and prosperity in the region.”“If Trump is planning to stand firmly behind the promises he made, that he wants to see an end to all these wars and that he is looking for peace and stability and normalisation, I’m sure he is aware and his team is aware that a war in the region does not serve these goals,” Naim added.“If he is really planning to achieve stability and security in the region and to concentrate on other issues, he has to exercise pressure on Netanyahu and his racist government and coalition to stop this madness, to stop behaving as a rogue state, or as a state above the law.”“Personally, I believe he will do it,” he added.Sultan Barakat, a political analyst and public policy professor at Qatar Foundation’s Hamad Bin Khalifa University, told Al Jazeera that Hamas emerged from the 15-month war proving its resilience despite Israel’s all-out military efforts to eradicate it.“They are not going anywhere,” Barakat said, adding that this has made the group an ongoing political reality Trump cannot avoid.Hamas, for its part, recognises Trump’s decisive role over his predecessor, while understanding that his administration does not necessarily signal an improvement.“It’s not about him being better for the Palestinians. But I think that they saw the difference he made when he entered the negotiations, the pressure he was able to exert,” said Barakat. “With Biden, for 15 months, they were fed lots of promises, and many red lines that Israel crossed with no consequences.”“They do see him as a serious person who said ‘Stop’,” he added. “But it doesn’t mean that he’s going to be on the side of the Palestinians.”Barakat stressed that there were other moments in the past in which Hamas felt optimistic about US policy towards Palestine, including in 2017, when the group amended its charter and removed language explicitly calling for Israel’s destruction.But the United States “failed them”, Barakat added. While the current ceasefire agreement was a first step, he added, the second and third phases of the deal, concerning reconstruction and governance in Gaza, remained vague.Still, Trump was able to break through a stalemate.“With Biden, they reached the very bottom of what is expected of a world leader. And not only the Palestinians, I think everybody involved in the process felt the same,” Barakat said. “He introduced many red lines and they were all crossed. He couldn’t do anything.”Barakat, who was involved in negotiations between the US and Afghanistan’s Taliban, under the first Trump administration, noted that a similar dynamic played out at the time.“When you have someone who comes in and says, ‘You do this, and we don’t know what he said to the others, but they did it,’ that on the surface is worthy of admiration,” he added. “They admire him. But they don’t trust him moving forward.”","Hamas leaders say they are ‘ready’ to talk with Trump. Do they trust him?","2025-06-24T20:38:08.507105Z"

The first comprised 72 prisoners arrested before the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel.A second list of inmates to be freed contained 111 names of people from Gaza detained after the attacks, which sparked the war in the Palestinian territory.In an earlier statement on Telegram on Friday, the armed wing of Hamas, the Qassam Brigades, named the three Israeli captives to be released as Israeli-French citizen Ofer Kalderon, Israeli citizen Yarden Bibas and Israeli-American Keith Siegel.Bibas, 34, is the father of Kfir, who was nine months old when the family was taken by Hamas in October 2023, and Ariel, who was four at the time.There has been no Israeli confirmation on the fates of Kfir, Ariel or their mother, Shiri.But Hamas said in late 2023 that the children and their mother were killed by an Israeli bombardment in the early months of the Gaza war.Siegel, currently in his 50s, was taken captive with his wife, Aviva, who was released by Hamas in the first captives-for-prisoners exchange in November 2023.Kalderon, also in his 50s, was abducted by Hamas with his two children, Erez and Sahar. The children were also released in that first exchange.Al Jazeera’s Laura Khan, reporting from Amman, Jordan, because Al Jazeera has been banned from operating in Israel, said the Israeli prime minister’s office said it has received and accepted the list.She said Bibas’s release is going to be viewed as particularly symbolic and important in Israel.“He’s interesting for two reasons. One is that there was a sticking point between Israel and Hamas in these negotiations, and that was whether to release men under 50. At first, Hamas didn’t want to do that. They wanted to release civilians, women and youth first, but then they decided to [yield] to that point,” she said.She said the second reason was that Israelis had expected Bibas as well as Siegel and Kalderon to be released earlier as part of the first phase of the ceasefire, which took effect on January 19.“However, they haven’t yet been released, and Israeli forces have said in the past that they are concerned about their wellbeing,” Khan said. Under the terms of the Gaza ceasefire, 33 captives held by Hamas in Gaza are to be freed in the first six weeks of the truce in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, many of whom have been serving life sentences in Israel.So far, 15 captives held in Gaza, including five Thai workers, and 400 Palestinian prisoners have been exchanged.On Thursday, Hamas released three Israelis and five Thai captives and Israel released 110 Palestinian prisoners after delaying the process after crowds swarmed one of the captive handover points.Reporting from al-Rashid Street in Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said that for many Palestinians in Gaza, the return of the Palestinian detainees is a “deeply symbolic victory” that represents resilience.But he said many people were shocked by the chaotic scenes around the release of Israeli captives on Thursday.“This includes the release of Arbel Yehud, which was criticised as completely disorganised and lacking the dignity expected during such sensitive moments,” he said. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has drawn criticism in his country for not having sealed a captive-prisoner deal earlier in the war after the security failure that enabled Hamas-led fighters to burst across the Gaza-Israel boundary and storm nearby Israeli communities.But there has also been opposition to the current deal, which some critics in Israel have said leaves the fate of most of the captives in the balance and Hamas still standing as Gaza’s dominant entity.At least 1,139 people were killed and more than 200 were abducted in the Hamas-led attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023. Israel’s military response has killed more than 47,000 Palestinian people in Gaza, according to the enclave’s Ministry of Health.About half the captives were released in November 2023 during the only previous truce, and others have been recovered dead or alive during Israel’s military campaign in Gaza.More talks on the implementation of the second stage of the current truce, due to begin on March 1, are meant to open the way to the release of more than 60 other captives, including men of military age, and a full Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza.If that succeeds, a formal end to Israel’s war in Gaza could follow along with talks on the mammoth challenge of reconstructing the Palestinian enclave.","Three Israelis and 183 Palestinians to be freed in next Gaza ceasefire swap","2025-06-28T10:47:43.740152Z"

It also accused UNRWA staff members of being part of the October 7 attack. Israel has not provided evidence for its claims and accusations.Subsequently, it passed legislation severing ties with the agency, which came into force on Thursday, a move likely to hamper its vital services after 15 months of war in Gaza.The agency is banned from operating on Israeli soil and contact between it and Israeli officials is also forbidden.“If UNRWA is not allowed to continue to bring and distribute supplies, then the fate of this very fragile ceasefire is going to be at risk and is going to be in jeopardy,” Juliette Touma, director of communications of UNRWA, told a Geneva press briefing on Friday.UNRWA issued the warning as the United Kingdom, France and Germany reiterated their “grave concern” over Israel’s ban.“We urge the government of Israel to work with international partners, including the UN, to ensure continuity of operations,” the joint statement from the three nations, published by the British government, said.In a statement, UNRWA spokesperson Jonathan Fowler admitted that the organisation is now operating in a “nightmare scenario”.Fowler said UNRWA has 5,000 staff still working in Gaza as the “backbone of the international aid operation” and their work may be compromised by the situation.“Our biggest fear is that there is no plan B,” he said.Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres, earlier insisted that despite the ban, “UNRWA clinics across the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, are open.”Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York, said while UNRWA’s work continues, Israel has not renewed visas for at least a dozen of the agency’s workers.After the law came into effect, Norway announced it would contribute $24m to the agency.“Gaza is in ruins, and UNRWA’s help is more necessary than ever,” Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said.Turkiye condemned the Israeli move as “a blatant violation of international law” and said it “marks a new phase in Israel’s policies of occupation and annexation aimed at forcibly displacing Palestinians from their own land”.On Wednesday, Israel’s Supreme Court rejected a petition by Palestinian human rights group Adalah contesting the ban, but noted the legislation only forbade UNRWA operations on “the sovereign territory of the State of Israel”, not in Gaza and the West Bank that it has occupied.The ban does apply, however, to Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, where UNRWA has field headquarters for its operations in the West Bank.In response, Adalah said the law would come into effect “disregarding the catastrophic humanitarian consequences”.","Gaza ‘ceasefire at risk’ if UNRWA forced to stop operations","2025-07-14T22:00:15.577001Z"

Meanwhile, the humanitarian operations in Gaza continues, including with UNRWA work there.”For more than 70 years, UNRWA has provided support for Palestinian refugees across the Middle East, but the organisation has often clashed with Israeli officials over its work.Israel has repeatedly accused UNRWA employees of involvement in the October 7 attack without providing proof.Ahead of the ban coming into effect, Israel’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein said that “humanitarian aid doesn’t equal UNRWA”, adding that “alternative” organisations exist that can facilitate aid into the Gaza Strip.On Wednesday, Israel’s Supreme Court rejected a petition by human rights group Adalah to contest the ban.However, the court noted that the legislation “prohibits UNRWA activity only on the sovereign territory of the State of Israel” but “does not prohibit such activity in the areas of Judea-Samaria [occupied West Bank] and the Gaza Strip”.On Tuesday, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini told the UN Security Council that his organisation has delivered “two-thirds of all food assistance, provided shelter to over a million displaced persons” since October 2023.“Since the ceasefire began, UNRWA has brought in 60 percent of the food entering Gaza, reaching more than half a million people. We conduct some 17,000 medical consultations every day,” he said.Lazzarini added that UNRWA had been victim to a “fierce disinformation campaign” to “portray the agency as a terrorist organisation”.In April 2024, former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna released a report for the UN investigating Israeli claims that UNRWA had staff that were Hamas members.The report found that while there were some “neutrality related issues”, Israel presented no evidence to support its allegations.Since its creation in 1949 to serve and handle the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians forcibly displaced by Israel’s creation a year earlier, UNRWA has symbolised the hope of refugees to return home.The organisation – employing 30,000 staff, primarily Palestinian refugees along with a small number of international employees – delivers emergency relief, education, healthcare and social services to at least 5.9 million Palestinians within Palestine and neighbouring countries.Sitting in front of the rubble of his destroyed home in Khan Younis, 74-year-old Abu Nael Hamouda described UNRWA as “a lifeline across generations” – one that has provided education, healthcare and food in times of peace and war alike.“UNRWA is the lung that Palestinian refugees breathe from,” says Hamouda, who himself originally hails from what was once the Palestinian town of Majdal.

The prison advocacy group also published a list of the names and ages of the prisoners to be released, which included at least 30 children.Among the names included on the list is Zakaria Zubeidi, 49, a prominent former Palestinian resistance fighter and theatre director whose dramatic jailbreak from an Israeli prison in 2021 thrilled Palestinians and stunned security officials in Israel.Zubeidi once led the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, which is affiliated with the Fatah party that controls the Palestinian Authority (PA), and was active during uprisings against Israeli occupation between 2000 and 2005, The Associated Press reports.In 2019, after Zubeidi had already served years in Israeli prisons, he was arrested again.But in 2021, he and five other prisoners tunnelled out of a maximum-security prison in northern Israel, an escape that helped solidify Zubeidi’s image among Palestinians as a folk hero.He and the five other escapees were recaptured later.In 2006, Zubeidi established The Freedom Theatre in the Jenin refugee camp – his home in the north of the occupied West Bank – to promote cultural resistance to Israel.The theatre, which has brought its original theatre productions on tour internationally, provides a creative outlet for local men, women and children to process their experiences living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank.Violent Israeli raids are common in the Jenin refugee camp, which is seen as a centre of Palestinian resistance within the occupied West Bank.Israeli forces are currently carrying out an intensive military operation in the camp, which has entered its second week and has killed at least 16 Palestinians and wounded dozens.Israel’s military said on Wednesday that it had killed 18 Palestinians and arrested 60 in Jenin and Tulkarem as part of its ongoing operation in the occupied territory.The 110 Palestinians due to be released will bring to a total of 400 Palestinians released from Israeli prisons as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas continues to hold.In that time, Israeli forces have arrested dozens more Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including 12 Palestinians arrested in occupied East Jerusalem for allegedly violating a ban on “expressions of joy” and “identification with Hamas” during the second release of prisoners last week.Prior to the current round of prisoner releases, 10,400 Palestinians were being held in Israeli custody, including more than 3,300 held in administrative detention without charge or trial.The records of Palestinian prisoners do not include Palestinians detained by Israeli forces during their war on the Gaza Strip, of which many are health workers, including Dr Hussam Abu Safia, the director of Gaza’s Kamal Adwan Hospital.Israeli soldiers detained Abu Safia on December 29 after violently attacking his hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip.Last week, the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights said Israeli authorities had extended a ban preventing Abu Safia from meeting with his lawyers until February 6 after Israel’s Ashkelon Magistrates Court extended his detention without charge until February 13.According to a joint statement from Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups, Palestinian residents of Gaza taken prisoner by Israeli forces have been held separately from other Palestinian prisoners, including in “ad hoc, army-administered detention camps, primarily situated in the Naqab desert in southern Israel”.“Testimonies from released prisoners indicate that the torture inflicted on Gaza detainees has reached unprecedented levels,” the rights groups Addameer, Al Mezan, Al-Haq, and the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR) said last year, following the news that Palestinian orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Adnan al-Bursh, had been killed in Israeli custody.</ p>","Israel to free 110 Palestinian prisoners in latest Gaza ceasefire exchange","2025-07-15T20:35:58.745626Z"

While Israel argues that UNRWA supports “terrorism” by providing aid to Hamas, the ruling has drawn criticism from much of the international community, including some of Israel’s closest allies.While the recent Israel-Hamas ceasefire has made aid shipments into Gaza of up to 600 trucks per day possible, the absence of UNRWA, the largest aid organisation working in the Strip, poses a significant risk for its inhabitants.For families like Hamouda’s, who have relied on the agency for generations, the absence of UNRWA is not just a logistical challenge; it represents “a death sentence for millions of Palestinian refugees, in Gaza and beyond”, he says.As the deadline for UNRWA’s closure approaches, refugees are left to wonder what will happen next, especially after United States President Donald Trump called for Palestinians in Gaza to move to Egypt and Jordan, a proposal rejected by Palestinian leaders, the UN, and Egypt and Jordan, and threatens to add more refugees to the 5.9 million who are dispersed in Palestine and around the world.In the southern Gaza refugee camp of Khan Younis, Abu Ahmed Hamad, a father of 10 who was forced to leave his home in Beit Hanoon in Gaza’s north to flee the violence, reflects on his family’s reliance on the agency during times of peace and war. He and his wife hold UNRWA ID cards too.“UNRWA is a lifesaver,” Hamad says. “It has been a safe haven for us – providing food, shelter and healthcare, and even recreational activities for our children during the war.”Despite the efforts of other humanitarian organisations, Hamad is sceptical about whether they can replace UNRWA’s comprehensive services. “The war proved that UNRWA is the most capable of handling the crisis. Other groups were operating, but they barely covered a fraction of the needs of the Palestinian people,” he says, citing the sheer number of UNRWA workers and expertise in numerous wars imposed on Palestinians.“Palestinians are the ones who know most the importance of UNRWA and why it’s being targeted, in particular by Israel and the US. Replacing it by any other organisation is futile for Palestinians, and a grave victory for the occupation,” he stresses. “It’s an erasure of the Palestinian refugee cause altogether.”The agency’s establishment in 1949 was directly linked to United Nations Resolution 194, which affirms the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and receive compensation for their losses.Many Palestinians view the agency as a key pillar in their fight for justice and recognition, and they regard its closure not only as a loss of vital services but also as an attack on this fundamental right.“This is bigger than aid,” says Ibrahim Abdel Qader, a refugee from the Khan Younis camp. “What they’re trying to do is erase the refugee issue and the right of return.”Sami Mshasha, an expert on Palestinian refugee issues and a former spokesman for UNRWA, asserts that the agency has been hit hard by Israel.“UNRWA is pivotal in many ways,” Mshasha says. “Israel’s actions against UNRWA bears massive political devastation for refugees in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, not to mention the symbolic significance in shutting down its 70-year-old headquarters in [occupied East] Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah.”Mshasha notes that more than 200 UNRWA facilities in Gaza have been destroyed, and hundreds of staff members were killed during the war. This is in addition to the massive financial cuts impacting the agency’s ability to fulfil its responsibilities. The agency launched a feeble emergency appeal for $464m, “but this amount falls far short of the $1.7bn it needs annually to sustain its operations in the five main locations it operates in”, he notes.The US, a key donor to UNRWA, has also been criticised for its support of Israel’s actions. In January 2024, the Biden administration cut funding to the agency following Israel’s allegations that 12 of its 13,000 staff members were involved in the October 7 attack on Israel carried out by Hamas, exacerbating the financial strain.Mshasha also criticises UNRWA’s leadership for its handling of the ban. “There’s no clear plan from the agency’s top management to navigate the crisis, despite 13,000 staff in Gaza ready to serve”, the expert adds.He questions why UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini has yet to visit Gaza. “He is one of the UN’s most senior officials in the Middle East. He should be on the ground, ensuring that UNRWA begins to recover instead of leaving Gaza to navigate this crisis alone,” Mshasha says.While Israel continues its efforts to undermine UNRWA, the agency must respond with decisive action. “Yes, the commissioner-general faces Israeli pressure, but the scale of Gaza’s catastrophe demands a stronger response and a clear recovery plan. Otherwise, the situation will only get worse,” Mshasha adds.Hamouda, the 74-year-old who has lived through multiple wars and displacement, fears for the future of his family as the ban comes into effect. He doesn’t want them to face these hardships without the agency that has sustained them for generations.“If UNRWA goes, we will have nothing left,” he says. “We can’t survive without it. It is the only thing that has kept us alive.”This piece was published in collaboration with Egab.","‘We will suffocate’: Palestinian refugees in Gaza fear UNRWA ban","2025-07-14T21:46:49.783175Z"

But speaking in one of his final appearances as Secretary of State on January 14, Blinken struck a different tone.“We assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost,” Blinken said. “That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war.”Hamas has undoubtedly been hit hard in the last 15 months, analysts and experts told Al Jazeera. It has likely lost thousands of fighters, including its military leader Yahya Sinwar, and, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), its weapons stockpile is depleted.But as the dust settles in Gaza, it is clear that Hamas has not been eradicated and still has a presence in the Gaza Strip.Hamas fighters have prominently featured in the handover of Israeli captives as part of the ceasefire deal with Israel. And members of the Hamas-run civil administration have resumed work. If there is any authority in Gaza, it still appears to be Hamas.“Hamas has an interest in creating an image of strength that is extremely orchestrated, and we should see that as a propaganda exercise,” Hugh Lovatt of the ECFR, told Al Jazeera.Lovatt added, however, that after “over a year of fighting, the [Hamas] fighters remain very much in control of Gaza”.“Hamas is trying to show Israel that it failed to destroy it but also that the movement will have a veto over Gaza’s future going forward because neither Israel, the PA [Palestinian Authority], or the international community will be able to impose a post-conflict governance or security arrangement,” Lovatt said.The scenes during the captive releases have caught many off guard, including Palestinians in Gaza.“I was very surprised to see the number of the Qassam [Hamas’s military wing] fighters during the release of the Israeli captives,” Fathi al-Ladawi, 67, displaced from Rafah to Nuseirat in central Gaza and a father of eight, told Al Jazeera. “The scale of the strikes and bombardment, especially in northern Gaza, made us think Hamas’s human and military resources had been significantly depleted. But what we saw proves they are still strong – perhaps even stronger than before.”“[Hamas] was able to hold on to its hostages, who looked to be in good condition, and was able to negotiate and sign a ceasefire agreement with the parties that swore to annihilate it,” Omar Rahman, a fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, told Al Jazeera.Hamas has also, according to Blinken’s statement, been able to recruit enough fighters to replace those it lost during the war.The actual number of Hamas fighters killed during the war is difficult to know for certain. Hamas claims it has lost between 6,000 and 7,000 members from its armed and civilian wings, according to an ECFR report, based on interviews with two senior Hamas members. But, the report says, most of Hamas’s estimated 25,000 fighters are likely still alive and in hiding.Netanyahu claimed that 20,000 “terrorists” had been killed as of November 2024, while Israel’s Military Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said approximately 3,000 had been killed between October 6, 2024, and the ceasefire. The UN’s Human Rights Office says that nearly 70 percent of the verified deaths during this period were women and children.“Only Hamas knows how many members of their military wing, the Qassam Brigades, were killed,” Hamze Attar, a Palestinian military analyst who is from Gaza, told Al Jazeera. “We’re seeing several posts mourning the relatives in a way that uses language indicating that they were fighting, but Hamas did not announce anything.”Among the few acknowledged losses are a handful of Hamas’s leaders.On the first day of the ceasefire on January 19, Hamas’s spokesperson, known only as Abu Obeida, delivered what he claimed was a “victory speech”. He paid tribute to some of Hamas’s fallen members, including Sinwar, whose death was recorded by an Israeli drone in October; political bloc leader Ismail Haniyeh, killed in Tehran in late July; and Saleh al-Arouri, killed in Lebanon in January 2024.Attar pointed out that Abu Obeida did not include the name of Mohammed Deif, the elusive figure who was one of the al-Qassam Brigades’ founders. Israel claimed to have killed Deif in late July, but the death was never officially acknowledged by Hamas.Among the living include the reported de facto head of Hamas in Gaza, Mohammed Sinwar, a figure Israel considers more hardline, well-trained and more of a mastermind than his late brother, Yahya, and Ezzedine Haddad, who oversees the Qassam Brigades in northern Gaza.Israel’s stated goals also included destroying Hamas’s infrastructure, most notably its vast network of tunnels. However, according to Israeli media, Hamas’s tunnel network is still largely operational, though estimates about how much of it is still intact vary significantly. Hamas members told ECFR that many of the tunnels have been restored or preserved and, in some cases, even expanded.Hamas’s rocket arsenal may have been significantly depleted by Israel. Still, the improvised and primitive rockets can be rebuilt with unexploded ordnance that remains around Gaza.Hamas recycles “unexploded Israeli rockets, bombs, and artillery shells to use as improvised explosive devices and produce new projectiles”, the ECFR report said.Hamas’s adaptability as a fighting force, developed over the years as a reaction to Israel’s tactics against it, means it has been built to take numerous blows and still be able to carry on as an organisation.Hamas is not only a military organisation but has run the Gazan government since 2006, when it beat Fatah in the elections.The movement’s popularity has grown in the West Bank, especially since it led an attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. In Gaza, some have expressed dissenting opinions towards the group, but there is still little evidence that its popularity has not been greatly impacted by the war.Some criticisms have attacked Hamas’s failure to predict Israel’s lengthy and brutal response to the attack. Others have claimed Hamas dragged them into a war the people of Gaza, nearly all of whom have lost family, friends and their homes, did not ask to be a part of.One of their critics was 45-year-old Wael Darwish, from northern Nuseirat.“This was a catastrophe, not a victory,” he said. “We’ve suffered the greatest disaster in history. If there’s any minor triumph, it’s because of the people’s resilience, not Hamas.”“While I don’t deny the sacrifices of the resistance, we’re tired,” Darwish said. “The resistance must also consider its people. We’ve shed enough blood.”“If Hamas remains in power, I’ll leave Gaza immediately,” he continued. “Many feel the same.”Even before October 7, Hamas faced domestic opposition – including protests against the group’s policies. Some Palestinians in Gaza, however, said the last 15 months had changed their opinion of the group.“I was happy to see the people, their numbers, and the safety of the Hamas fighters,” Fatima Shammali, 64, a mother of 11, told Al Jazeera. “Although I don’t usually support Hamas, my support for them grew during the war because they managed to counter, even slightly, the Israeli military arsenal.”Nihal Barakat, 43, a mother of eight who was displaced from the Shati refugee camp to Nuseirat, agreed. “I expect Hamas’s popularity has increased after this war,” she said. “As for its strength, it remains intact, and we hope it is channelled for the benefit of the people.”“It is clear that many Gazans are frustrated and angry at [Hamas],” Lovatt said. People were angry that Hamas didn’t think through the consequences of their October 7 attack and failed to plan for the “inevitable, disproportionate violent response against Gaza”, Lovatt added.Lovatt said that criticism of the group was “felt in Hamas itself”, especially among the moderate wing of the group. There were “a lot of criticisms of [late Hamas leader] Yahya Sinwar’s actions and that of a few others who took unilateral decisions”, the analyst said, based on his interviews for the ECFR report.But even disapproval should not be taken as an endorsement of Israel’s tactics or its occupation of Palestine, experts said.“During the genocidal war on Gaza, people did not collaborate [with Israel] because they are the enemy and an occupation,” Attar, the military analyst, said. “It is not about Hamas. It is about identity, the resilience and the continuity of Palestinian people. It is not because they love Hamas, but because they love Palestine.”“The occupation of our land must end. The world needs to stand with us to determine our fate,” al-Ladawi, the displaced father of eight, said. “Spare us from more war; we are exhausted. We should not be punished simply because among us are members of Hamas, Fatah, [Palestinian Islamic] Jihad or any other faction.”","Analysis: Hamas has been hit hard by Israel, but is not out in Gaza","2025-07-14T21:44:07.333496Z"

Newborn care has also been severely impacted, with one doctor at al-Helal al-Emirati Maternity Hospital in Rafah saying that the facility had so few incubators and so many preterm babies that doctors there were forced to put “four or five babies in one incubator”.“Most of them don’t survive,” the doctor added.Several babies have died from the lack of shelter amid freezing temperatures.In the 56-page report, HRW concluded that Israel — as the occupying power in Gaza — has violated the rights of pregnant women and girls, including the right to dignified care in pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period, as well as the right to newborn care.The group also stressed that two pieces of legislation passed by the Israeli Knesset last year and taking effect on Tuesday threaten to “further exacerbate the harm to maternal and newborn health”. The bills, which bar UNRWA from operating in Israel and occupied East Jerusalem and the Israeli government from contact with the agency, effectively make it impossible for UNRWA to get permits for its staff and to deliver much-needed aid to Gaza.Belkis Wille, HRW’s associate crisis, conflict and arms director, told Al Jazeera that “despite the fact that the ceasefire could provide an opportunity for the healthcare system in Gaza to begin to be restored, because of the laws coming into effect, banning the operations of UNRWA, the reality is that these coming weeks may lead to pregnant women and newborns suffering even more than they already have”.“The provisions of the ceasefire don’t really address any of the significant needs that are outlined in the report,” Wille added.According to the report, as of this month, emergency obstetric and newborn care is only available at seven out of 18 partially functioning hospitals across Gaza, four out of 11 field hospitals, and one community health centre.All medical facilities operating in Gaza face “unsanitary and overcrowded conditions” and serious shortages of essential healthcare supplies, including medicine and vaccines. And medical workers, “hungry, overworked and at times under military attack”, are scrambling to tend to victims of attacks while also addressing countless cases of waterborne and other communicable diseases, the report adds.HRW conducted interviews with women who were pregnant while living in Gaza during the war, medical workers from Gaza, and international medical staff working with international humanitarian organisations and agencies operating teams in Gaza.The interviews paint a horrific picture of the war’s impact on access to basic care during pregnancy and birth.Little information is available on the survival rate of newborns or the number of women experiencing serious complications or dying during pregnancy, birth, or postpartum, HRW notes. But the group points to testimony by maternity health experts who reported that the rate of miscarriage in Gaza had increased by up to 300 percent since war began on October 7, 2023. It also pointed to UN reports that at least eight infants and newborns have died from hypothermia due to lack of basic shelter.Israel’s war has led to an unprecedented displacement of some 90 percent of Gaza’s residents, many of whom were displaced multiple times. That has made it impossible for pregnant women to safely access health services, the report found, noting that mothers and newborns have had almost no access to postnatal care.Late last year, Human Rights Watch concluded in a different report that Israel was committing “acts of genocide” by denying clean water to Palestinians in Gaza. It also found that Israel’s use of “starvation as a method of warfare” led to severe food insecurity.Pregnant women have been particularly impacted by lack of access to food and water, with critical consequences for their own health and for fetal development. Many pregnant women have reported dehydration or being unable to wash themselves, the report added.“Israeli authorities’ blatant and repeated violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in Gaza have had a particular and acute impact on pregnant women and girls and newborns,” Wille said. “The ceasefire alone won’t end these horrific conditions. Governments should press Israel to urgently ensure that the needs of pregnant women and girls, newborns, and others requiring health care are met.”","‘Five babies in incubator’: HRW on danger to pregnant women, babies in Gaza","2025-07-15T20:46:20.013286Z"

Being a journalist who speaks up for Palestine and against Israel’s genocide and settler-colonial savagery and those who aid and abet it,” he wrote.Abunimah was arrested in Zurich on Saturday before he was set to deliver a speech in the city, sparking outrage from Palestinian rights advocates.The Swiss embassy in Washington, DC, did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.The Reuters news agency reported on Sunday that the Swiss police cited an entry ban and other measures under the country’s immigration law as the reason for Abunimah’s arrest.The Palestinian American journalist said that when he was questioned by police officers, they accused him of “offending against Swiss law” without providing specific charges.He said he was “cut off from communication with the outside world, in a cell 24 hours a day”, adding that he was unable to contact his family. He added that he was only given back his phone at the gate of the plane that flew him to Istanbul.Abunimah noted that during the period when he was taken to prison like a “dangerous criminal”, Switzerland welcomed Israeli President Isaac Herzog to the World Economic Forum in Davos.Herzog has sparked controversy for his stance on Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians. He previously said that there are no “uninvolved civilians” in Gaza.“This ordeal lasted three days but that taste of prison was more than enough to leave me in even greater awe of the Palestinian heroes who endure months and years in the prisons of the genocidal oppressor,” Abunimah said.“More than ever, I know that the debt we owe them is one we can never repay and all of them must be free and they must remain our focus.”United Nations experts had decried Abunimah’s detention as an assault on free speech.Irene Khan, a UN special rapporteur for freedom of opinion and expression, described Abunimah’s arrest as “shocking news” on Saturday and urged his release.Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, also called for an investigation into the incident.“The climate surrounding freedom of speech in Europe is becoming increasingly toxic, and we should all be concerned,” Albanese wrote in a social media post.Abunimah’s detention came amid an increased clampdown on pro-Palestine voices in Europe amid the war on Gaza, which UN experts have compared with genocide.In April, Germany shut down a conference for Palestinian rights advocates and denied entry to the British doctor Ghassan Abu Sittah, who had worked in Gaza.Activists have also accused German authorities of cracking down on protests throughout the war.In October 2024, British counterterrorism police raided the home of Abunimah’s Electronic Intifada colleague Asa Winstanley — an incident that the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said was part of a “disturbing pattern of weaponizing counter-terrorism laws against reporters”.Months earlier, British authorities held journalist Richard Medhurst, who is vocally critical of Israeli policies, for 24 hours as he arrived in London.Medhurst said on Saturday that the “terrorism” investigation against him was extended until May.In Gaza, Israel has killed 205 journalists since the start of the war in October 2023, according to local authorities.","Switzerland releases, deports Palestinian American journalist Ali Abunimah","2025-06-24T20:30:24.748473Z"

When the girls heard the gunfire, they started running inside. Her [al-Khatib’s] mother was feeding her [when] she got a bullet from the sniper in her head,” she said, adding that the girl was her mother’s only child.The Israeli army has in recent years carried out multiple raids and incursions in Jenin, long seen as a symbol of Palestinian resistance. Its latest operation began only a day after a ceasefire took effect in the Gaza Strip, where some 15 months of Israeli attacks have killed more than 47,000 Palestinians.Separately on Saturday, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that Ahmad Mahmoud Hashash, 42, also died of his wounds on Saturday after being shot by Israeli forces during a raid on Balata refugee camp in the central West Bank.The ongoing military operation in Jenin and its adjacent refugee camp has killed at least 14 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry. Dozens have been wounded while thousands have been forced from their homes.Before the latest Israeli attacks began on Monday, the security forces of the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, carried out a weeks-long operation to reassert control in Jenin.In addition to the loss of life, the Israeli army raids have caused widespread destruction, including the bulldozing of key roads and the demolition of houses.Breaking the Silence, a group of former Israeli soldiers calling for an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, said last week that Jenin faced being “Gazafied” by the Israeli military, “complete with air strikes and destruction of infrastructure”.Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation is aimed at eradicating “terrorism”.","Israeli forces kill 2-year-old Palestinian girl in occupied West Bank raid","2025-07-15T20:39:34.689250Z"

They will now be exchanged for 200 of the roughly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners waiting to be released from Israeli prisons during the first six-week phase of the Hamas-Israel ceasefire, which came into effect on Sunday.Under the terms of the agreement, Israel agreed to release 50 Palestinian prisoners for each Israeli soldier being held in Gaza and 30 for any of the other female captives during the first phase of the ceasefire. The remaining captives will be released during the second phase of the agreement, negotiations for which are due to commence on February 4.A third phase is intended to focus on the rebuilding and long-term governance of Gaza.Ariev, 20, was serving at the Nahal Oz army base, about 1km (0.6 miles) from the boundary with Gaza at the time of her abduction. In July – hoping to put pressure on the Israeli government, which many of the captives’ families felt was stalling on their release – her parents released an image provided to them by Hamas purporting to show Ariev during her first few days of captivity.In the undated image, Ariev can be seen sitting with her head bandaged alongside Albag, Agam Berger and Gilboa, who also had a bandage on her head.She was later identified by her parents from a video published on Telegram that day by Hamas. Her abduction was confirmed by the Israeli military about 48 hours laterGilboa, 20, was also at the Nahal Oz base. Gilboa featured in a video released by Hamas in July, appealing to the Israeli government to bring her and the other captives home.Levy, 19 at the time of her capture and now 20, had just begun her military service when Hamas attacked, the BBC quoted her mother as saying. Hours after her abduction, she appeared in a Hamas video that showed her being bundled into a Jeep.Albag, 19, was serving as an army lookout at the Nahal Oz base. She was believed by her family to have been hiding from a rocket barrage in a field shelter during the Hamas-led attack. Albag was later identified in a Telegram video of captives published by Hamas that day.Of the female soldiers taken, only 21-year-old Berger will remain in captivity if Saturday’s exchange goes as planned. Three other female soldiers were released in the initial exchange on Sunday.It was mixed.Many people in the occupied West Bank celebrated the release of 90 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons early on Monday – 69 women and 21 children. Many people showed their elation at being reunited with family members and friends. Crowds carried released prisoners over their heads while cheers and whistles accompanied them.Amanda Abu Sharkh, 23, had come just to see the arrival in Ramallah of the Red Cross buses carrying the prisoners. “We came here to witness it and feel the emotions, just like the families of the prisoners who are being released today,” Abu Sharkh told the AFP news agency.“All the prisoners being released today feel like family to us. They are part of us, even if they’re not blood relatives,” she said.In contrast, the intense relief of many Israelis over Sunday’s return of Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari was mixed with anger and resentment from a sizeable minority who saw the exchange as a defeat in Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed at least 47,283 Palestinians.In the West Bank, the Israeli military began a raid on Tuesday on the town and refugee camp of Jenin, and incensed Israeli settlers targeted six villages that they had identified as being where the released Palestinian women and children are from, attacking houses, shops, cars and buses with firebombs.They were worried about how that would look.There have been several reports of police visiting the homes of Palestinian prisoners, removing flags, signs and sweets and ejecting anyone, including journalists, who are not close family members. Scuffles between journalists covering the delight of Palestinians having family members returned have also been reported.Family members of released prisoners were also reported to have been summoned to police stations and warned against organising celebrations or marches to mark their releases. Family members also told Israel’s Haaretz newspaper that they had been instructed by police not to comment about the releases on social media or to grant media interviews.Israeli determination to avoid the exchange being framed as a defeat also extended to the prisoners themselves. Rula Hassanein, who was released on Monday, told of how the women had been forced to kneel on the ground for hours before they were freed and watch a looped 90-second video that told them: “This is not a victory for you. We have destroyed and killed in Gaza, in Yemen, in Syria, in Iran. We killed [your] leadership,” she recalled.“We were not allowed to look left or right, only at the screen,” she told CNN.According to the Israeli NGO HaMoked, being arrested by the Israeli authorities for any infraction, no matter how slight, is routine for Palestinians.According to a 2017 report by the prisoners rights association Adameer, 40 percent of all male Palestinians have at various points been arrested by Israeli forces.HaMoked said this month that 10,221 Palestinians were jailed by Israel, of whom 3,376 were being held under administrative detention. Administrative detention allows Israeli authorities to hold prisoners for indefinite periods without charge or, in some cases, without even explaining what they are being held for.Dania Hanatsheh was among the many released on Monday who had been held in administrative detention. “Palestinian families are prepared to be arrested at any moment,” Hanatsheh, who said she has never been told why she had been detained, told US-based ABC News. “You feel helpless, like you can’t do anything to protect yourself.”Dire ones.Shatha Jarabaa, 24, who was arrested in August for a social media post that Israeli authorities deemed “incitement” told the United Kingdom’s Guardian newspaper that she had lost 14kg (31lb) during five months of imprisonment.“The treatment in prison was so bad,” she told the newspaper. “Each prisoner had only one outfit. It was bitterly cold inside the detention centre. The rain would fall on us inside the cells. My arrest was illogical and unjustified. The charge was incitement and support for terrorist organisations due to posting Quranic verses on social media.“It was a way to imprison as many women as possible because of the prisoners inside Gaza and to exchange them for the Israeli hostages. We were hostages as well because we were imprisoned against our will without any credible charges.”The Israeli prison system and the conditions Palestinians are held in have been the focus of acute criticism by rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Israel’s B’Tselem.Several rapes have been reported over the course of the war. In August, many of Israel’s leading politicians took to the streets to defend soldiers who had been serving as prison guards against charges of having gang-raped a Palestinian detainee. A few months later, in November, UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese described prominent Palestinian surgeon Adnan Al-Bursh as likely having been “raped to death”.At the time of his death, Dr Al-Bursh was being held at Ofer Prison near Ramallah, the same facility where many of the women and children released this week had been held.In its August report on the Israeli prison system titled Welcome to Hell, B’Tselem documented the treatment meted out to Palestinians in more than a dozen prison facilities transformed since the outbreak of the war in October 2023 into what the NGO described as “a network of camps dedicated to the abuse of inmates as a matter of policy”.","Who are the female Israeli soldiers released by Hamas?","2025-07-14T21:37:17.733340Z"

Dozens have also been wounded and detained.On Friday, the situation at Jenin government hospital was “dire”, Saadi said, with medical staff struggling to provide care to patients amid power cuts and fuel shortages caused by the ongoing Israeli operation.Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut said many Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including in Jenin, fear Israel will do “just as it did in Gaza”.“In their thousands, Palestinians have been forced to leave their homes in the Jenin refugee camp,” said Salhut, who is reporting from Jordan because Al Jazeera has been banned by the Palestinian Authority (PA) from reporting in the occupied West Bank.“People there say Israeli forces want to raze these Palestinian towns to the ground just as they did in Gaza.”Sources told Al Jazeera that Palestinian fighters have also been fighting back against Israeli forces, targeting them with an explosive device while they were travelling along Jenin’s Nazareth Street. There were no immediate reports of casualties.In some of the ongoing raids, PA security forces were involved in going after Palestinian fighters, including in Tulkarem, Ramallah, Hebron and Qalqilya on Friday.Armed clashes have also broken out between Palestinian fighters and PA forces in the town of Yabad, west of Jenin.PA security forces have reportedly severely beaten up a number of Palestinian fighters after arresting them.Later on Friday, the United Nations voiced serious concerns over Israeli military’s use of force in West Bank, including methods “developed for war fighting”.“We are deeply concerned by the use of unlawful lethal force in Jenin, in the occupied West Bank,” UN human rights office spokesman Thameen al-Kheetan told a media briefing in Geneva.“The deadly Israeli operations in recent days raise serious concerns about unnecessary or disproportionate use of force, including methods and means developed for war fighting, in violation of international human rights law, norms and standards applicable to law enforcement operations.”Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst Marwan Bishara said the Israeli government is shifting its focus from Gaza to the occupied West Bank.He said the operations in Jenin and other parts of the occupied West Bank serve as a “deflection” from the Israeli government’s failures of October 7. Bishara added that the operation also creates an opportunity for Israel to advance annexation policies.Since the war on Gaza began in October 2023, Israeli forces have increased the size and frequency of their raids in the occupied West Bank, killing nearly 900 Palestinians and wounding thousands.Israel says eliminating armed Palestinian fighters in the occupied West Bank is part of its overarching goals for the war on Gaza.

Four of them had been killed by Israeli drone attacks and three were shot dead.Israeli forces arrested 22 Palestinians across the occupied territory between Wednesday evening and Thursday morning, according to the Commission of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society.The groups said in a joint statement on Telegram that the arrests took place in the governorates of Hebron, Nablus, Tulkarem, Ramallah and Jerusalem, and involved “abuse and destruction of infrastructure, and vandalism and destruction of citizens’ homes”.The Jenin refugee camp, set up in 1953 by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) to accommodate displaced Palestinians, is a hub for Palestinian resistance groups operating under the umbrella of the Jenin Brigades and has long been a focal point for Israeli military incursions.Israel’s army has defended its deadly incursion into the occupied West Bank. The raid in Jenin aims to counter “hundreds of terrorist attacks, both in [the occupied West Bank] and the rest of Israel”, military spokesman Nadav Shoshani said.Since the start of the Gaza war, Israel has seen “over 2,000 terror attack attempts” from the occupied West Bank, he said, adding the army “eliminated around 800 terrorists”.The Palestinian Authority’s Foreign Ministry accused Israel of “collective punishment” and said the raid was part of an Israeli plan aimed at “gradually annexing the occupied West Bank”.The attacks on Jenin are just one element of Israel’s intensified operations in the West Bank, which the Palestinian Authority (PA) says are aimed at “gradually annexing” the territory.Recent Israeli raids across the West Bank include:The sudden uptick in settler attacks and Israeli military operations has frightened Palestinians in the occupied territory, who believe they could now face the same fate as their compatriots in Gaza.Residents have also reported a significant increase in Israeli checkpoints and delays across the territory.Palestinian lawyer Mohammad Dahleh told Al Jazeera that the Israeli military’s ramped-up assault on the occupied West Bank has to do with the agreement about the ceasefire.“They want to continue the war in Gaza and the way to do that is escalation in the West Bank.”Speaking to Al Jazeera from Bethlehem, Palestinian researcher and activist Hamza Zubiedat said the situation in the occupied territory has become “catastrophic”.“By isolating and cutting the Palestinian villages and cities from each other, it means no more doctors, nurses, teachers, even transporting the goods and fruits and vegetables from one place to another.“It means more poverty and suffering for the Palestinian people,” he said.Zubiedat said Israel was carrying out “a continuous annexing process” with the support of the US administration of Donald Trump, with the new United States president having already lifted sanctions imposed on more than 30 Israeli settler groups and entities by his predecessor.Elise Stefanik, President Trump’s nominee for US ambassador to the United Nations, told US senators on Tuesday that Israel had a “biblical right” to the West Bank.In response, Farhan Haq, spokesman for the UN chief, told Al Jazeera, “The future of that of the West Bank, Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories as a whole needs to be dealt with through negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian authorities.”","Israeli army continues deadly raid in Jenin, two more killed in West Bank","2025-07-14T21:45:52.575624Z"

Israeli forces had also detained about 20 people from villages around Jenin since the operation began on Tuesday, he said.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for “maximum restraint” from Israeli forces in Jenin and expressed deep concern, according to his deputy spokesman, Farhan Haq.On Monday, Guterres told a UN Security Council meeting of his fears over “an existential threat to the integrity and contiguity” of Gaza and the occupied West Bank from Israel and amid the “unabated” expansion of illegal Israeli settlements.The UN chief said that “senior Israeli officials openly speak of formally annexing all or part of the West Bank in the coming months”.“Any such annexation would constitute a most serious violation of international law,” he said.","Minister says Israel applying ‘lessons’ from Gaza in West Bank operation","2025-06-28T10:56:23.937972Z"

Israel has killed more than 46,900 Palestinians in Gaza since its war started on the enclave in October 2023.“We watched a genocide unfold in Gaza for 14 months and nobody in the world did anything to stop it and some people here think we’ll suffer a similar fate,” said Shady Abdullah, a journalist and human rights activist from Tulkarem.“We all know we fear that the situation could get much worse here in the West Bank,”  he told Al Jazeera.Hours after the Gaza ceasefire began on January 19, Israel began erecting dozens of new checkpoints in the West Bank to prevent Palestinians from gathering and celebrating the release of political prisoners, who were let go in a swap for Israeli captives held by Hamas as part of the deal.The checkpoints also prohibited farmers from reaching their farmlands and sealed civilians in entire cities, such as in Hebron and Bethlehem.Israeli settlers then began expanding illegal outposts in the West Bank and attacking Palestinian villages. Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are illegal under international law, and many of the haphazardly constructed outposts are even illegal under Israeli law, although often little is done to remove them, and many later become formalised.“The implications of the violence is that it leads to direct or associated displacement and that falls in line with Israel’s objective of preventing any Palestinian state on their land,” said Tahani Mustafa, an expert on Israel-Palestine with International Crisis Group.In addition, the Israeli army announced plans to carry out major operations in the West Bank, which began on January 21 with a major incursion into Jenin camp, ostensibly to root out armed groups. Israeli raids on the West Bank predated the war on Gaza, but scaled up in violence and intensity with the onset of the war.“The settler violence and incursions we are seeing … is an indicator of where we are heading now,”  Mustafa told Al Jazeera.The uptick in violence has led some to believe that new United States President Donald Trump made a trade-off with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to pause the war on Gaza in exchange for stepping up aggression in the West Bank.“The ceasefire in Gaza – which looks more like a humanitarian pause and “trade of hostages and prisoners” – comes with a price. Israel never ever relinquishes anything without a price to be paid and I think we are seeing that in the West Bank, given the sort of [officials] the Trump administration is composed of,” Mustafa said.Trump has not indicated that there is any kind of deal with Netanyahu to allow him to increase violence in the West Bank, but he has also refused to commit to a two-state solution, and has nominated several figures who are opposed to Palestinian statehood to prominent positions in his administration.The potential for an increased crackdown on Palestinian fighters in the West Bank, as well as the growth of illegal settlements and even potential annexation, appears to have incentivised Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich to remain in Netanyahu’s frail coalition, rather than pull out and collapse the government as a way to protest the ceasefire in Gaza.Under Smotrich, Israel has quietly confiscated more land in the West Bank over the last year than it has in the last 20 years combined, according to Peace Now, an Israeli nonprofit monitoring land grabs.Both Smotrich and the broader settler movement have long viewed the occupied West Bank as an integral part of “greater Israel”, and refer to the territory as Judea and Samaria.Smotrich’s rapid annexation of the West Bank went largely unnoticed due to the much larger crisis in Gaza, where, in addition to the mass killing of Palestinians, nearly the entire pre-war population of 2.3 million people were uprooted and displaced.Palestinians across the occupied West Bank now say that settlers are stepping up attacks in coordination with the Israeli army to confiscate and seize more land.On January 20, settlers violently attacked two villages in the northern West Bank, Funduq and Jinasfut, as well as villages further south in Masafer Yatta and around Ramallah.The settlers set homes and cars ablaze and beat up Palestinians under the full protection and watchful eye of the Israeli army, according to local rights groups.However, the head of the Israeli army’s Central Command, General Avi Bluth, said in a statement that any “violent riot harms security and the army will not allow it”.The attacks came during Trump’s inauguration as US president – in one of his first actions as president he reversed sanctions on groups and individuals who the US had previously deemed part of the “extremist settler movement”.“The aim of the settlers is known,” said Abbas Milhem, the executive director of the Palestinian Farmers Union. “They want to transfer Palestinians outside of the West Bank and annex the land to Israel and impose Israeli law.”Ghassan Aleeyan, a Palestinian living in Bethlehem, expressed his frustration to Al Jazeera.“What these people are doing is illegal, but they don’t care about international law, or Palestinian law or Israeli law,” he told Al Jazeera. “They don’t even care about God’s law.”In early December, armed groups in Jenin began clashing with the Palestinian Authority (PA), an administration created as a result of the 1993 Oslo Accords.The accords jump-started a now-defunct peace process that ostensibly aimed to establish a Palestinian state across the occupied Palestinian territory, with East Jerusalem as its capital.A key element of the Oslo Accords was tasking the PA with rooting out and disarming armed groups as part of its security coordination with Israel.But as hopes for statehood faded and Israel entrenched its occupation, a number of neighbourhood armed groups loosely connected with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hamas and even Fatah – the faction in control of the PA – emerged in Palestinian camps across the West Bank.With the PA unable to crush the armed groups in Jenin camp, Israel launched a major operation on January 21, which has already killed at least 10 people.Local monitors told Al Jazeera that Israel is justifying its operation under the guise of buttressing Israel’s security and ensuring that another October 7-style assault does not occur, even though the armed groups in the West Bank are far less capable and organised than Hamas in Gaza.“We believe Israel’s plan is to attack the north of the West Bank in the same way it did during the second Intifada when it invaded Palestinian camps,” said Murad Jadallah, a human rights monitor with al-Haq, a Palestinian rights group.Israel previously occupied the Jenin camp for 10 days in 2002, destroying about 400 houses and displacing about a quarter of the residents during the second Intifada in 2002, according to the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA).Mustafa, from the ICG, believes Israel will conduct more incursions and major military operations across the West Bank in the coming days in an attempt to crush all forms of resistance.“The battlefield is about to shift from Gaza to the West Bank,” she said.","‘The battlefield is about to shift’: West Bank braces for rising violence","2025-07-14T21:32:31.847692Z"

Inside the morgue at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, he was hoping to find a trace of his missing son. Instead, he was met only with unidentified body parts and fragmented remains.The sight left him collapsed on the ground, overwhelmed by grief and exhaustion. Yet, he gathered his strength and continued searching for any trace of 17-year-old Muhammed, shifting his focus from bodies to personal items: a pair of sandals patched with yellow plastic or an orange sweater, a black jacket, tracksuit pants – anything that could belong to his son.“Has anyone seen a patched sandal with a yellow sole? Please, if you find it, let me know,” Abu Muhammed pleaded with others who, like him, had come to the morgue early on Tuesday to look for their loved ones among the remains of dozens of bodies that the Palestinian Civil Defence had salvaged from beneath the rubble in Rafah, south of Khan Younis on the Egyptian border. Tears streamed down his face as he sank to his knees and leaned against the wall. “I’m no longer looking for his body – just his sandal. You see what we’ve come to?” he muttered, a mix of sorrow and helplessness in his voice.A ceasefire that came into effect on Sunday between Israel and Hamas has enabled hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to their mostly-demolished homes in Rafah and elsewhere in the Strip. Relentless shelling for 15 months has driven nearly 2 million Palestinians in Gaza into displacement, many without the chance to properly reclaim the bodies of loved ones who perished beneath bombing and rubble.The devastated infrastructure and Israel’s targeting of ambulances and civil defence also hindered their ability to reach sites struck by bombs.Muhammed has been missing since November. He had left the family’s displacement camp in al-Mawasi for what he said would be a quick trip to retrieve belongings from their home in Rafah.He never returned.Abu Muhammed is certain his son was killed by Israeli fire or shelling while trying to return home. “He wanted to bring back some of our belongings and return to the camp. But he brought back nothing, and he didn’t come back either,” he told Al Jazeera.In the days since the Israeli military partially withdrew from Rafah, local rescue teams and medical staff have recovered dozens of remains and body parts, which were transported to the Nasser and European hospitals in Khan Younis for identification. With the news circulating, families with missing loved ones have flocked to these sites, hoping to find closure.For Abu Muhammed, it was the final hope he had to find his son.Since the day he went missing, Abu Muhammed spared no effort in searching for him. He contacted the Red Cross, the Ministry of Health and anyone who might help. He even returned to his destroyed home in Rafah, combing through its rubble. “I’ve looked everywhere. His mother is on the verge of losing her mind, and his sisters are desperate for answers,” he said.The war has killed about 47,000 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. However, the globally-renowned Lancet medical journal expects the actual number of deaths to be 41 percent higher than the announced toll.In May, the United Nations humanitarian arm, OCHA, said more than 10,000 people were believed to be buried under the rubble in Gaza, adding that it could take up to three years to retrieve those bodies, given then the very primitive tools in the territory.After hours of sifting through the rubble of his destroyed home in Rafah, a heartbroken Faraj Abu Mohsen found no trace of his son. On his way back to Khan Younis, where his family is displaced, the 42-year-old came across body parts and torn clothing about 200 metres (656 ft) from the ruins of his house – items he recognised as belonging to his son.“I had given up hope of finding him alive. While walking back to Khan Younis after searching all day, my foot struck some bones. I moved them aside and uncovered clothing that belonged to my son – his black shirt, blue pants, and sneakers. I knew it was him,” Faraj recalled, sorrowfully. He gathered the remains in a bag, buried what he could, and promised to return to search for more.“None of us imagined that all we’d have left of him would be a few bones,” he said, his voice heavy with grief.Inside and outside the morgue at Nasser Hospital, a heart-wrenching scene unfolded. Desperate families described physical features or clothing in the hope of identifying their loved ones.“My son recently had a tooth implant,” one mother said.Another father called out, “He was wearing blue jeans.”Others spoke of height, build, or unique items like a cowboy hat or a patched sandal.Adding to the pain were the stark labels written on the shrouds: “Skull without a lower jaw”, “Bone fragments”, “Rib cage”, or “Upper and lower limbs”. Instead of names and ages, medical teams documented the details left of Palestinians slain by Israeli artillery to help families identify the remains. Alongside these notes were descriptions of personal items found with the remains – rings, watches, shoes, or damaged ID cards.The lack of DNA testing capabilities in Gaza significantly hampers identification efforts, Dr Ahmed Dhahir, a forensic medicine consultant with Gaza’s Health Ministry, explained, adding that Israel has long restricted the entry of DNA testing equipment into the Strip. “Without this technology, many bodies remain unidentified, leaving families in perpetual anguish,” he said.Dr Dhahir outlined the identification process: remains are first retrieved by rescue teams, then examined and documented. Details such as the recovery location, date and any personal items are recorded. Given the state these bodies have been found in, forensic experts rely heavily on circumstantial evidence, such as clothing or belongings, to guide families.“We follow legal protocol by keeping the bodies for up to 48 hours to allow families an opportunity to identify them. After that, the remains are buried by the Ministry of Endowments and Civil Defence in a designated cemetery, with specific numbers and records maintained for potential future identification if testing equipment becomes available,” Dr Dharir said.He also noted that one-third of the remains recovered from Rafah so far – about 150 cases – remain unidentified.“The most challenging cases are those involving partial remains: a skull, leg bones or fragments of a ribcage. These are carefully numbered and catalogued, but without DNA testing, definitive identification is often impossible,” he added.Current forensic resources in Gaza are limited, with only three specialists available in the southern region and none in the north, Dr Dhahir explained, adding that this shortage strained an already overwhelmed system, especially with the sheer volume of remains recovered following Israeli attacks.For families like Abu Muhammed’s, the inability to locate or identify loved ones prolongs their grief. “We just want to know his fate,” Abu Muhammed said. “Even if all that’s left of my son is a bone, we want to bury him and say goodbye.”The forensic teams face mounting pressure, not just from families but also from the growing backlog of remains. Dr Dhahir emphasised the need for international assistance. “We urgently need DNA testing equipment and trained specialists to help identify victims. This is not just about closure for families – it’s a humanitarian necessity,” he said.As efforts continue, families cling to hope, no matter how faint. For Abu Muhammed, the search for his son has become a daily ritual, one he cannot abandon despite the emotional toll. “I’ve lost count of the shrouds I’ve opened. I don’t know if I’ll ever find him, but I’ll keep searching,” he said.The tragedy of unidentified remains underscores the broader human cost of the conflict. Beyond the staggering death toll lies an equally painful reality: families left in limbo, searching for answers amid the rubble of their lives.For many, closure feels like an unattainable dream – one stolen by war and the lack of resources to mend its wounds.This piece was published in collaboration with Egab.","‘Skull without a jaw’: Gaza survivors search for what remains of the dead","2025-07-15T20:47:59.775506Z"

Israel has severely restricted supplies of aid to the territory, leading to warnings of a humanitarian crisis.Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani was speaking at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday, two days after the ceasefire that Qatar helped broker came into effect in Gaza.The prime minister cautioned that Palestinians in Gaza – and not any other country – should dictate the way the enclave will be governed.“We hope to see the PA back in Gaza. We hope to see a government that will really address the issues of the people over there. And there is a long way to go with Gaza and the destruction,” he said.Sheikh Mohammed, who is also Qatar’s foreign minister, said that his country was sorry for the time wasted in the talks between Israel and Hamas.“When we look at and reflect on what we have achieved in the last few days, we felt really sorry for all the time … wasted in these negotiations,” he said.“We have seen that the framework that we have agreed on in December is the one that’s been realised a couple of days ago, and … I’m talking about December ’23, this means just a year of negotiating details” the prime minister said.He added that this included “some meaningless things compared to the lives of the people that they have lost”.How Gaza will be governed after the war was not directly addressed in the agreement between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian group that ran Gaza until the war.The ceasefire agreement between the sides was mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States and includes a truce, the exchange of Israeli captives for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, and a surge in humanitarian aid deliveries.Israel has rejected any governing role for Hamas, but it has also opposed rule by the Palestinian Authority, the body set up under the Oslo interim peace accords three decades ago that has limited governing power in parts of the occupied West Bank.The PA, dominated by the Fatah faction created by former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, faces opposition from rival faction Hamas, which prevailed in elections and then drove the PA out of Gaza in 2007 after a brief war.","Qatar PM hopes Palestinian Authority will return to Gaza when war ends","2025-07-15T20:33:19.786581Z"

The sanctions were imposed by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, via an executive order in February.Biden’s actions paved the way for the US Departments of State and the Treasury to sanction several far-right individuals and groups accused of perpetrating violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967 despite international law, freezing their US assets and barring US bodies and individuals from commercial relationships with them.As much of the world’s attention has focused on the war in Gaza, growing violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank and land grabs in the occupied territory have raised concerns among some of Israel’s Western allies.On Monday and Tuesday, settlers set vehicles and properties on fire under the protection of Israeli soldiers. At least 21 Palestinians were reported to have been injured.Since Israel’s war on Gaza began in October 2023, at least 860 Palestinians, including 175 children, have been killed and more than 6,700 wounded in attacks by the Israeli army and settlers across the West Bank, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.“Lifting sanctions on extremist settlers encourages them to commit more crimes against our people,” the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.Israeli officials welcomed Trump’s “historic decision” to reverse the sanctions.Yossi Dagan, head of the Northern West Bank Settlements Council, said the reversal of the “scandalous sanctions” was “a political message that the United States has returned to being our friend,” according to Israeli media.“This is a righting of an injustice of many years, in which distorted policies were pursued by the American administration and also by local elements who confused lovers with enemies,” Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right former national security minister said on X.His ally, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, said Trump’s stand shows his “deep connection to the Jewish people and our historic right to our land”.“These sanctions were a serious act of blatant foreign interference in the internal affairs of the state of Israel and harmed the principles of democracy and the mutual relationship between the two friendly countries,” he said.US sanctions on settlers landed after the Biden administration repeatedly urged the Israeli government to take action to hold settlers to account for actions that Washington believed set back hopes for a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians.Since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Israel has occupied the West Bank of the Jordan River, which Palestinians want as the core of an independent state. Israel has built settlements there, which are illegal under international law.Israel disputes this and cites historical and biblical ties to the land.","Trump lifts US sanctions on Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank","2025-06-24T20:02:22.697520Z"

Some attending the gathering carried the flags of Fatah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other armed resistance groups.Seven hours earlier, three Israeli women captives in their mid-20s to early 30s were released in Gaza.Bushra al-Tawil, a Palestinian journalist jailed in Israel in March 2024, was also among the prisoners released on Monday.Tawil said she began her journey at 3am on Sunday morning (01:00 GMT), when she was taken from another Israeli prison ahead of release. In the second prison, she was grouped with other Palestinians awaiting release.“The wait was extremely hard. But thank God, we were certain that at any moment we would be released,” she said.Tawil said her father, who is also in an Israeli jail, will be released soon, too.“I was worried about him. He is still a prisoner, but I just received good news that he will be released as part of this deal,” she added.Amanda Abu Sharkh, 23, from Ramallah, was among the crowd of hundreds who gathered to greet the freed prisoners.“We came here to witness it and feel the emotions, just like the families of the prisoners who are being released today,” Abu Sharkh said.“All the prisoners being released today feel like family to us. They are part of us, even if they’re not blood relatives,” she told the AFP news agency.Muhammad, 20, said he had come from Ramallah with his friends as soon as he heard the prisoners would be released.Recently freed from Israel’s Ofer Prison himself, he expressed “great joy” at the thought of families being reunited.“I know a lot of people in prison, there are innocent people, children and women,” he said.The prisoner exchange between Hamas and Israel marks the first of its kind since November 2023.The exact number of Palestinians due to be released as part of the ceasefire deal is still unknown, with reported estimates ranging from approximately 1,000 to nearly 2,000.In the first phase of the deal, Hamas is expected to return a total of 33 Israeli captives over the next 42 days – with the next release due on Saturday.The second phase of ceasefire negotiations is due to begin in two weeks.More than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began on October 7, and nearly 90 percent of Gaza’s population has been forcibly displaced by Israeli evacuation orders and attacks.","Tears, hugs greet 90 Palestinian women, children freed from Israeli prisons","2025-07-15T17:44:00.632221Z"

The al-Qidra family had endured 15 months of Israeli attacks. They had been displaced more than once. Their relatives had been among the more than 46,900 Palestinians killed by Israel.But the al-Qidras had survived. And they wanted to go home.Ahmed al-Qidra packed his seven children onto a donkey cart and headed to eastern Khan Younis. It was finally safe to travel – the bombing should have stopped.But the family did not know that the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas had been delayed. They did not know that, even in those additional few hours, Israeli aircraft were still flying over the skies of Gaza, ready to drop their bombs.The explosion was loud. Ahmed’s wife Hanan heard it. She had stayed behind at a relative’s home in the centre of the city, organising their belongings, planning on joining her husband and children a few hours later.“The blast felt like it hit my heart,” Hanan said. She instinctively knew that something had happened to her children, whom she had only just said goodbye to.“My children, my children!” she screamed.The cart had been hit. Hanan’s eldest son, 16-year-old Adly, was dead. So was her youngest, six-year-old Sama, the baby of the family.Yasmin, 12, explained that a four-wheel drive was in front of the cart carrying people celebrating the ceasefire. Perhaps that was the reason the missile hit.“I saw Sama and Adly lying on the ground, and my father bleeding and unconscious on the cart,” Yasmin said. She pulled her eight-year-old sister Aseel out before a second missile hit the spot where they had been. Eleven-year-old Mohammed also survived.But Ahmed, Hanan’s partner in life, was pronounced dead in the hospital.Sitting on the edge of her injured daughter Iman’s hospital bed in Khan Younis’s Nasser Hospital, Hanan was still shell-shocked.“Where was the ceasefire?” she asked. In their excitement to finally return to whatever was left of their home, the family had missed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declaring that the Palestinian group Hamas had not sent over the names of the three Israeli captives who would be released on Sunday as part of the ceasefire deal.They had not seen Hamas explain that there were technical reasons for the delay, and that the names would be provided, as they eventually were.They would not know that in the three-hour delay before the ceasefire eventually began, three members of their family would be killed. They were among the 19 Palestinians killed by Israel in those last few hours, according to Gaza’s Civil Defence.Hanan broke down in tears. She would now have to face life without her husband and without two of her children. The loss of Sama, “the last of the bunch” as she described her with the Arabic saying, was particularly hard.“Sama was my youngest and the most spoiled. She’d get angry whenever I talked about having another child.”Adly had been her “pillar of support”. Her children were her world.“We endured this entire war, facing the harshest conditions of displacement and bombardment,” Hanan said. “My children dealt with hunger, a lack of food and basic necessities.”“We survived more than a year of this war, only for them to be killed in its last minutes. How can this happen?”A day of joy had been turned into a nightmare. The family had celebrated the end of the war the night before.“Hasn’t the Israeli army had enough of our blood and the atrocities they committed for 15 months?” Hanan asked.Then, she thought of her future. With her husband and two of her children ripped away from her, and with tears coming down her face, she asked: “What’s left?”","‘My children, my children’: The Gaza family killed minutes before ceasefire","2025-06-28T10:32:57.236104Z"

My children are extremely happy to go and see our families, relatives and our lands,” she told Al Jazeera.“Here, we are always scared and worried, but back home we will be very happy, and joy will come back to our lives .”A young Palestinian man said, “Everyone is happy, particularly the children.”“Hopefully, the Israelis will not violate it [ceasefire] in the next few days,” he told Al Jazeera.He said all he wanted to do now was complete his education. “There have been loads of dreams destroyed during this genocide.”Gaza’s health workers and rescuers were also seen celebrating in the streets. Videos shared online, and verified by Al Jazeera, showed several civil defence teams chanting and raising victory signs.Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from outside Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir el-Balah, said there were “no violations reported since the ceasefire took effect”.“There have been no more bombs, no more fighter jets, and no more drones. The only sound of gunfire we hear is from celebrations in the streets – gunshots and fireworks have been frequent,” he said.Before the ceasefire came into effect, Israeli forces killed at least 19 more Palestinians and wounded dozens of others on Sunday, taking the total death toll in the 15-month genocide to nearly 47,000. Palestinian and rights groups say the actual number could be much higher.At least 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023, and about 250 were taken captive.Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Khan Younis, said Palestinians from the southern city of Rafah described the destruction caused by Israel there as “massive”.“They did not even realise where their neighbourhoods were,” she said.“Nevertheless, people are very happy. You see everyone smiling, you see everyone chanting, and most of the Palestinians are saying: ‘We made it alive out of this war.'”Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud reported that in the hospital courtyard where he was reporting from, Palestinian families had started to dismantle their tents and head back to their homes they were forced to evacuate due to relentless Israeli bombings.“What we are witnessing here is families excitedly gathering their belongings – whatever they managed to collect during their stay at the hospital. There is so much excitement on their faces as they leave the hospital gates,” he added.Anwar, a displaced Palestinian man living in Khan Younis who did not give his last name, said he hoped to return to Rafah despite reports that his home had been destroyed.“I will go there and I will see to find a place where I can set up a tent to live with my eight-member family,” he told Al Jazeera. “I need to go back to my city. I need to go back to where I was born.”Anwar said the months of war were like a “nightmare”. “It was literally a nightmare, as if we [were] dreaming and then we got up again,” Anwar said.He said he and his family lived in flimsy tents without enough food or water, and that prices for goods were “scarily high”.Other displaced people have reported returning home only to find the scale of destruction makes it hard to even put up a temporary shelter.Mahmoud Anwar Abu-Salem, a displaced Palestinian from northern Gaza, has spoken to Al Jazeera following his return to his area after spending three months in Gaza City’s Shati refugee camp.“The house, the whole thing, was reduced to rubble. Fifty members of my family will live in the streets,” he said, explaining that before the war, the five-floor building housed many of his relatives.“Schools have also been destroyed. There is no life at all,” Abu Salem said. “Even the mosque was targeted and destroyed. It is even difficult to set up a tent here.”Nour Saqqa, a displaced Palestinian woman from Gaza City, said she feels an “overwhelming mixture of emotions”.“We haven’t been able to feel completely relieved, not only because of how stressful these 15 months have been, but also due to the ceasefire itself – the fact that it has been fragmented rather than announced and implemented all at once,” Saqqa told Al Jazeera in Rafah.Saqqa said the fact she and other Palestinians from Gaza City are still not allowed to return to their homes in the first phase of the ceasefire is causing the population “even more psychological stress”.“We are constantly living through this uncertainty and anxiety that even this relief is not completely full.”","‘Joy beyond measure’: Celebrations in Gaza as long-awaited ceasefire begins","2025-06-28T10:42:05.255468Z"

Even the faintest glimmer of light triggers excruciating pain in the teenager’s sensitive, swollen eyes, leaving Abeer with no choice but to heed her daughter’s agonised pleas to be covered again.Beneath the blanket lies a face marked by the relentless toll of cancer. A red mass protrudes from her left eye, her head appears shrunken, and her frail arms barely move. Her weakened voice and constant cries tell of the pain she’s endured since her diagnosis three months ago.Abeer prays that the Rafah crossing, which Gaza shares with Egypt and has been sealed shut by Israel since its ground operation in the southernmost region of the enclave in May, opens as soon as the ceasefire comes into effect early Sunday. “I don’t know how much longer Hanaa will survive,” she said.For thousands of wounded Palestinians in Gaza and patients like Hanaa, the ceasefire agreed to by the Israeli cabinet on Saturday after much political tension, is more than a diplomatic milestone; it’s a matter of survival. The Rafah crossing is expected to open as part of the deal, allowing Palestinians in Gaza to leave for medical treatment.The territory’s healthcare sector has been ravaged by the war, depleting it of human resources, equipment and infrastructure, and medical staff who have braved Israeli attacks and are left with little to offer their patients.“There is nothing that Gaza’s healthcare sector could offer these critical conditions: no medication, no specialists, no operations or procedures, no proper equipment,” Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of al-Shifa Medical Complex and head of the Department of Treatment Abroad, told Al Jazeera, adding that for many the only chance of survival is treatment abroad.The ceasefire is set to ease the exit of Gaza Palestinians in need of medical treatment through the Rafah border crossing. “The details of where patients will go for treatment are still not clear. The 5,300 Gazans who left for treatment since October 2023 went to Arab and European nations, as well as the US. It is still not clear the countries to which these cases will go,” noted Abu Salmiya.For Abeer, who also has two sons, the Rafah crossing is their family’s only hope to hold onto her Hanaa. “Hanaa diagnosis’ felt like a death sentence for our family,” said Abeer, her voice breaking as tears streamed down her face. “But to watch her condition worsen daily, with nothing that we or anyone in Gaza can offer, is another level of torment.”The family’s ordeal began when Hanaa’s eyes swelled, prompting a visit to an eye doctor who referred her immediately to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. There, tests confirmed the devastating news: Hanaa had cancer, with multiple tumours in her head.Abeer recounted how her once-energetic daughter, despite being born with cerebral atrophy and having a speech impairment, had thrived with sharp hearing, clear vision, and a zest for life. But since her diagnosis, Hanaa has lost her sight completely, and her hearing is rapidly deteriorating. A massive tumour in her throat has also meant she’s unable to eat, and she now relies on a feeding tube connected to her stomach.For three months, Hanaa has received no cancer treatment due to the lack of medical supplies in Gaza. “All she gets are painkillers to help her sleep,” Abeer said. “If it weren’t for this war and the blockade, Hanaa could have started treatment and recovered. Instead, her condition has worsened, robbing her of her senses and leaving her motionless.”According to Abu Salmiya, there are 20,000 patients and wounded Palestinians in Gaza in need of treatment, of whom 12,000 are in dire conditions. “Nearly 6,000 people wounded by the war need urgent treatment in facilities abroad. These include roughly 4,000 amputees, and more than 2,000 cases sustaining serious injuries to their backbone and their spinal cord, resulting in crippling and paralysis,” he said.In a speech delivered at a United Nations Security Council meeting on January 3, Dr Rik Peeperkorn, World Health Organization (WHO) representative for the West Bank and Gaza, said more than a quarter of the 105,000 civilians injured during the 15-month Israeli pounding of Gaza face “life-changing injuries”. Describing hospitals as “battlegrounds”, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk quoted WHO figures of 654 attacks on healthcare facilities, leading to 886 deaths and 1,349 injuries.According to the organisation, more than 1,000 healthcare workers have been killed since October 2023, adding further strain to an overstretched healthcare system, in which only 16 out of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are partially operational, and as few as 1,800 beds are available.“We’re losing patients with conditions that we could’ve easily handled if not for the war. We’ve lost nearly 25 percent of our dialysis patients. Infants with heart conditions are dying on a daily basis in incubators because we cannot operate on them. As many as 20 patients of curable illnesses die every day in front of helpless staff,” noted Abu Salmiya.For those critical conditions, exiting the territory has been “a tedious and futile process”, especially since the closure of the Rafah crossing, added the official. “Israel’s restrictions at the Karem Abu Salem [Kerem Shalom] border crossing [between Gaza and Israel] meant many weren’t allowed to leave although they were given the green light to. For instance, infants would be given permission to go, but without their mothers,” he explained. Only 490 medical conditions were allowed to leave the territories since May. “Out of 12,000 critical conditions, 490 is nothing,” commented Abu Salmiya.According to Abu Salmiya, a ceasefire must be accompanied by an influx of resources and an ease of departure for patients going out. “We urgently need plastic and burn surgeons, bone restoration consultants, as well as consultants in neurosurgery, vascular surgery, pediatric surgery, thoracic surgery, maxillofacial surgery and cardiac surgery,” he said.He also called on the WHO, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt to “ensure the safe and timely departure of medical cases to be hospitalised around the world, bearing in mind that most have lost their travel documents amidst the war and displacement,” pleaded the official.At Khan Younis’s Nasser Hospital, 14-year-old Raghd al-Farra lies in a hospital bed, barely able to speak. Her dream of surviving her injuries and living a normal life depends on receiving treatment outside Gaza.Raghd was critically injured on July 22, 2024, when an Israeli air strike hit her family’s home. “The pain never ends,” she said, her words slow and strained. Raghd has spent most of the past six months in the hospital, moving between departments for nerve, bone, and abdominal care.Her mother, Shadia al-Farra, recounted the day their home was bombed. Shadia and three of her daughters, including Raghd, were on the upper floor, while her husband and their youngest child were downstairs. “The walls collapsed around us,” she said. The strike also destroyed a neighbouring home, killing its occupants.Raghd’s injuries were severe. Doctors diagnosed her with two spinal fractures, complex fractures in her right leg, and massive internal bleeding. She underwent emergency surgery to remove her spleen and parts of her lungs, but her condition remains critical. “She still has severe fibrosis and other abdominal complications that require treatment unavailable in Gaza,” her mother said.In late August, doctors at Nasser Hospital prepared a file for Raghd’s transfer abroad, submitting it to Israeli authorities through WHO in mid-September. However, no approval has been granted, and Raghd’s condition continues to decline. She struggles to breathe, move, or eat, and recently had her tonsils removed to address further complications.Shadia fears her daughter’s time is running out. “If Rafah doesn’t open soon, Raghd won’t survive. Her life depends on specialised care that Gaza cannot provide,” she said.The stakes are high for patients and their families, who have endured immense suffering during the 15-month war. “Our children are dying in front of our eyes,” Shadia said. “We are powerless because our medical system is overwhelmed. The ceasefire and Rafah’s reopening are our only hope.”This piece was published in collaboration with Egab.","Palestinians in Gaza desperate to travel abroad for life-saving treatment","2025-07-15T20:43:00.730832Z"

That’s the ambitious goal of a new pseudo-3D stealth adventure game called “Dreams on a Pillow”, launched by Palestinian game developers.The game is inspired by the events of the 1948 Nakba or “catastrophe”, referring to the ethnic cleansing of 750,000 Palestinians from their homes located in what is now the state of Israel.It is slated to be released in 2026.So what do we know about the game that is launched at a time when Palestinians are hoping this week’s ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel for Gaza, where more than 46,000 people have been killed in the 15-month-long Israeli bombardment of the strip, will actually hold?The game is the brainchild of Rasheed Abueideh, a developer based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.“We are trying to make this game a masterpiece,” Abueideh, the game’s director and designer, told Al Jazeera. His last game, Liyla and the Shadows of War, based on the 2014 Israeli offensive in Gaza, was a huge hit.“It’s a heavy story. And we want to inject all of these pieces of information through a gameplay that resonates with the players,” he said.Abueideh, who is based in Nablus in the West Bank, says he would like the world to understand that the Israeli war on Gaza is a direct result of previous events and decisions beyond the event of October 7, 2023.The game, he says, is also an attempt to highlight and share the rich history of Palestine.Despite his past success, he has struggled to get funding from conventional sources. So he crowdsourced on LaunchGood, a global crowdfunding platform focused on supporting Muslim communities worldwide. Dreams on a Pillow reached its funding goal of $194,800 on January 7. At the time of writing, the video game project has raised $218,272.The current funding for the game is enough to start development and should cover costs for the first year including salaries, outsourcing and asset creation.According to Abueideh, LaunchGood emerged as one of the few viable options for fundraising efforts, as many mainstream crowdfunding platforms refused to help.Palestine-related content often faces heightened scrutiny and, in some cases, outright prohibition. The censorship or even the shadow banning of pro-Palestine content has been well documented.In May 2023, a YouTube video made by Palestinian officials, which was meant to be presented at a United Nations Human Rights Council meeting, was removed from the platform. The platform has been accused of violating the digital rights of Palestinians.Investigations by rights organisations and media outlets have revealed the removal and suppression of pro-Palestinian content from social media platforms such Instagram and Facebook.Netflix removed nearly all 32 films about Palestine on its platform. The streaming giant attributed the removal of the films to the expiration of three-year licensing agreements. However, this sudden deletion prompted an outcry from human rights groups and individuals across social media platforms, according to broadcaster TRT World.The central theme of the game is based on Palestinian folklore around the legend of Omm, a young mother who flees the 1948 Israeli massacre in Tantura, a Palestinian town now part of Israel.While escaping through other Palestinian villages and refugee camps on her way to Lebanon, she witnessed events that unfolded in these communities and cities along the way.According to Abueideh, this journey serves as a lens through which we observe the broader historical context and personal experiences of displacement during this tumultuous period.Omm’s husband falls victim to Israeli invaders. Frantically, she rushes home to save her newborn child. In her haste and terror, she flees the town, only to discover later that she had mistakenly grabbed a pillow instead of her baby.The story’s conclusion varies significantly depending on the storyteller and audience. In most renditions, the mother descends into madness. Other versions depict either her murder or her successful evasion of Israeli patrols and military units, leading to her escape from her homeland – a place she might not see again.In a recent Ask Me Anything (AMA) live on Reddit, Abueideh states why Omm was chosen:“The young mother’s experiences highlight how devastating the Nakba was, particularly the psychological impact it had on her. This adds a deeper layer to understanding what happened, shedding light on the emotional and mental toll that is often overlooked when discussing the crimes committed,” explained Abueideh.Zionist militias committed more than 70 massacres that resulted in the killing of more than 15,000 Palestinians leading up to the creation of Israel in 1948.In 2016, Abueideh’s small team of developers in Palestine released Liyla and the Shadows of War for PC and mobile platforms, which was based on Israel’s 2014 Gaza offensive.The Israeli military operation, named Operation Protective Edge, resulted in the killing of 2,300 Palestinians and 73 Israelis.According to Abueideh, Liyla and the Shadows of War was quite successful receiving millions of downloads and was awarded first place for Excellence in Storyboarding for the International Mobile Gaming Awards for Middle East North Africa.The game was built around a Palestinian family’s harrowing experience during Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, as they fought to stay alive amid the conflict and destruction.“We followed a story of a young girl who lives in Gaza. During these attacks, we try to build an emotional story. We connect people with what’s happening in Gaza, and we show them the decisions that you have to take as a Palestinian during the war, and regardless of your decision that you are taking, it’s hard to survive,” Abueideh says.Apple initially rejected the Game but later reversed its decision after public pressure. Abueideh says Liyla and the Shadows of War faced rejection due to its potent political themes.“Players must deal with the stark realities of life amid conflict, challenging them to navigate through relentless bombings and gunfire in search of sanctuary. The game mechanics operate no different than other games, although it is set in the Gaza Strip,” he says.Although Dreams on a Pillow is based in Palestine like Liyla and the Shadows of War, the game dynamics are different.“For the gameplay element you are playing with this character [Omm] holding the pillow which limits her ability to do stuff in the environment, but this pillow gives her safety,” stated Abueideh.The psychological effects of the Nakba are vividly portrayed through the game’s narrative story-building and mechanics.Omm finds solace and safety when carrying the pillow, which symbolises her childhood. However, when she sets it down, her mental state deteriorates rapidly. She can become plagued by nightmares and hallucinations, a reflection of the constant danger and trauma she experiences.Her psychological fear manifests through the game’s mechanics. At each level, set during the Nakba, she enters a dream state. In this dream, which also takes the form of a game, we witness Omm’s life before the Nakba, providing a stark contrast with her current experience.“This is our opportunity to show the culture of Palestine, the nature of Palestine. The habits of people before the Nakba, and how beautiful nature was. There is a lie about Palestine that’s been said in the Western media, ‘land without a people, for a people without land’”, Abueideh says.“We need to show that Palestine was rich in history and culture, filled with its people and their habits before what happened in 1948.”According to Abueideh, the game will require two years of development with a planned release due in 2026. Due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter, it’s unclear from the development team which platforms will accept the game.On May 14, 1948, immediately following the expiry of the British Mandate, Zionist leaders proclaimed the establishment of the State of Israel. The announcement ignited the first Arab-Israeli war, after which the Zionist forces gained control of 78 percent of historic Palestine.The remaining 22 percent was split into two areas: the West Bank, which is now under occupation, and the Gaza Strip, which has been turned into rubble by more than 15 months of non-stop Israeli bombardment.Approximately 750,000 Palestinians were forcibly displaced from their homes and territories following the violence unleashed by Zionist militias.The continued Israeli military control over Palestinian territories for decades has a negative impact on the daily lives of Palestinians. The prolonged occupation and enlargement of Israeli settlements on Palestinian land have imperilled the viability of a two-state solution – Israeli and Palestinian states coexisting side by side.","What is ‘Dreams on a Pillow’, the Palestinian game about the Nakba?","2025-07-15T20:43:41.231432Z"

Khan said Israel could still demonstrate its willingness to investigate, even after warrants were issued.This seems unlikely since Israel has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based ICC, denying war crimes despite its apparent failure to investigate the claims.The United States, Israel’s main ally, is also not a member of the ICC. Last week, the US Congress voted to sanction the court in protest against the warrants, a move Khan described as “unwanted and unwelcome”.Khan said Israel had very good legal expertise, but had not used its judges, prosecutors and legal instruments “to properly scrutinise the allegations that we’ve seen in the occupied Palestinian territories”.Khan’s comments came a day after Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire deal in Gaza following more than 460 days of war.Under pressure from hardliners in his government, who say the war has not achieved its objective of wiping out Hamas, Netanyahu delayed key meetings of the security cabinet and the cabinet, which were supposed to vote on the deal on Thursday.The security cabinet approved the ceasefire on Friday, paving the way for government ministers to vote on the deal in a full cabinet meeting.It was not immediately clear when the full cabinet would convene for the vote. A report in The Times of Israel said the second meeting would only be held on Saturday night, with full ratification coming after a mandatory 24-hour grace period to raise objections, raising the possibility that the ceasefire will not come into effect on Sunday as initially planned.Mustafa Barghouti, the secretary-general of political party the Palestinian National Initiative, told Al Jazeera that Netanyahu ran out of options to stop a ceasefire from being implemented.“He manipulated and tried to postpone it and to procrastinate because his main goal is to keep his government together. But it is very clear now that he cannot manoeuvre any more,” he said.","ICC prosecutor sees ‘no real effort’ by Israel to probe alleged Gaza crimes","2025-06-24T20:39:45.519437Z"

And in the lead-up to his inauguration, Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas have agreed to pause hostilities in Gaza, where more than 46,700 Palestinians have been killed in the last 15 months.But Luqman says she doesn’t feel vindicated, even though Trump has claimed credit for pushing the ceasefire deal over the line.Instead, she’s outraged at outgoing United States President Joe Biden for failing to finalise the agreement months earlier.“I’m just even more angry because Trump, who is not even in office, did a little arm-twisting, and the ceasefire agreement was done right away,” Luqman told Al Jazeera. “This could have happened sooner. It’s so sad, all those extra lives lost.”She added that the way the agreement was reached “solidified Biden’s legacy as Genocide Joe”, a nickname that links the Democratic leader to the Israeli abuses in Gaza.After overwhelmingly backing Democrats in previous elections, many Arab American voters turned against the party and its candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, in November’s race because of their support for Israel’s war.While many Arab voters say it is too early to celebrate the fragile ceasefire agreement, they stress that Trump’s intervention shows that they were right to abandon Harris.The shift in Arab American voting preferences was especially apparent in the swing state of Michigan.In predominantly Arab neighbourhoods on the east side of the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, Harris received less than 20 percent of the votes. The majority of residents either cast their ballots for Trump or Green Party candidate Jill Stein.While Harris argued that she and Biden had been working “tirelessly” to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza, the vice president also pledged to continue arming Israel without any conditions.The Biden administration also vetoed four United Nations Security Council resolutions that would have called for a ceasefire in Gaza.Amer Ghalib, the Yemeni American mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan, was among those who endorsed Trump last year, even appearing at his rallies.He explained that negotiating a ceasefire in Gaza was the top demand of the former president’s Arab and Muslim supporters.“He knew that it was a fair and humane request,” Ghalib told Al Jazeera in a statement.“We supported him and asked for ceasefire, peace, fighting Islamophobia, fair representation for Muslims in his administration and promoting and protecting faith and family values and safe education for our kids. He has shown some signs of moving forward to deliver on every one of his promises.”Both Trump and Biden claimed credit for the ceasefire agreement on Wednesday, with the incoming president asserting that the “epic” deal would not have been reached had he not won the elections in November.It is difficult, however, to assess the extent of Trump’s role in behind-the-scenes diplomacy.But several Israeli media reports have indicated that Trump was decisive in getting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to the pact, which will lead to the release of Israeli captives in Gaza as well as hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.Trump sent his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with mediators in Qatar and Netanyahu in Israel last week.On Thursday, the US president-elect appeared to confirm Israeli accounts that Witkoff pushed Netanyahu to accept the agreement.He shared on social media a Times of Israel article quoting an unidentified Arab official as saying: “Trump envoy swayed Netanyahu more in one meeting than Biden did all year.”Notably, Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani thanked Witkoff by name when announcing the deal on Wednesday.Trump had warned earlier this month that “all hell will break out” if the Israeli captives are not released by the time he takes office on January 20.Some analysts saw the message as a threat to Hamas. But the Palestinian group had repeatedly said that it would accept the ceasefire deal laid out by Biden in May, which included a prisoner exchange and a permanent end to the war.It was Netanyahu who publicly stated on several occasions that his government intends to continue the war.Still, Biden administration officials — including Secretary of State Antony Blinken — have insisted that Hamas has been blocking the agreement.Hala Rharrit, a former US diplomat who resigned last year over the Biden administration’s handling of the war, said the deal announced on Wednesday is the same proposal that had been on the table since May.Rharrit told Al Jazeera that the Biden administration’s months-long failure to finalise the agreement was a “matter of political will”.“If there was not a change in administration, I think we would have kept on hearing the exact same rhetoric of ‘We’re working tirelessly to secure a ceasefire,'” Rharrit said.She added that there would have been no shift had Harris gotten elected, but Trump’s victory created the incentive to make the ceasefire deal happen.Although Wednesday’s announcement sparked jubilation in Gaza, Arab American advocates are cautious about celebrating just yet.It is not clear whether Israel will honour the deal, which does not take effect until Sunday. In neighbouring Lebanon, a US-brokered ceasefire agreement in November has failed to stop daily Israeli attacks.Israel has also killed dozens of people in Gaza, including at least 21 children, since the deal was announced.Suehaila Amen, an Arab American community advocate in Michigan, said she hopes the ceasefire will come to fruition, but stressed that it is difficult to take the word of US and Israeli politicians.Still, she said an agreement reached after Trump’s intervention is further indictment of Biden’s unwillingness to get Israel to end the war.“For many within the community, pushing back against the Biden administration for their continuous funding of a genocide — as well as turning a blind eye to the verified and documented human rights violations — continues to be something we stand by,” Amen told Al Jazeera.Amen said voters are “well aware” that Trump helped complete the ceasefire deal.“As Biden leaves with a bloody legacy of genocide to his name, our work continues to ensure our rights are protected and no further harm or harassment ensues towards the Arab and Muslim American community, from the White House and on down,” she said.The way Walid Fidama sees it, the former president made “concrete promises” to end the war in Gaza when he met with Arab and Muslim advocates before the elections. A lifelong Democrat, the Yemeni American ultimately cast his vote for Trump in November.“We are happy that he helped with the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, and we hope it will not just be temporary,” Fidama told Al Jazeera.“We want the agreement to take full effect and allow displaced people to return to their homes.”But some members of the Arab American community are sceptical that Trump will bring lasting peace to the Middle East, as he promised on the campaign trail. After all, Trump has filled his incoming cabinet with staunchly pro-Israel aides, including Senator Marco Rubio, his nominee for secretary of state.And during his first term, from 2017 to 2021, Trump made a series of policy shifts that bolstered the Netanyahu government, including by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem.Luqman said she is under no illusion that the Republican establishment will distance itself from Israel, but ending the atrocities in Gaza “immediately in order to save more lives” was her top concern.“I’m not going to support Marco Rubio. But at the same time, I’m really conscientious that there aren’t many good options,” Luqman said.","Trump’s role in Gaza ceasefire fuels Arab American anger with Biden","2025-06-24T20:21:44.560677Z"

But their memories of the war will not go away any time soon.In Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, many people are displaced from other areas of the enclave after fleeing their homes in the wake of Israeli attacks or Israeli orders to leave or face bombing.They have struggled to survive. Many have lost their nearest and dearest and feel lucky to be alive. But what comes next is still unknown. And with the devastation across Gaza so evident and Israel seemingly unwilling to leave the territory alone, many pitfalls lie ahead in the future.Al Jazeera spoke to people in Deir el-Balah the day after Wednesday’s announcement of the ceasefire as they await its implementation on Sunday. Here’s what they had to say:Nahed al-Wer is a psychiatrist displaced with his family from the Bureij refugee camp at the start of the war after his home was destroyed. He now works at the Deir el-Balah clinic and also volunteers in his own time to meet people seeking psychological help for the traumas they have gone through during the war. It feels very nice. We’re so happy. It feels like it’s Eid. We hope this feeling remains forever and that we don’t see any more bloodshed. We hope that we don’t see it again and that we won’t have to live through this experience again. We all lost people. I lost my brother, my nephew, my other nephew and another relative.I’m worried that in the coming days we will see more escalation. This is the nature of the Israeli politicians. Before signing a ceasefire or before a ceasefire comes into effect, they continuously try to escalate the killing more and more. The pace of the killing intensifies. In 2014, on the last day of the war, I lost my sister and her children.There is still a great concern that the Israeli leadership might backtrack on agreements, and the pace of the killings has increased in the last two or three days, so I pray to God that this does not happen.After the war, there will be a large number of people suffering from very difficult psychological conditions – from tensions and phobias and the fears they have lived through. It’s possible that these conditions and psychological fatigue could even get worse and develop beyond depression.There must be treatment for these people. Even a few days ago, I had a case of an elderly woman whose son passed away. She was suffering from severe mental health problems and began psychiatry sessions to aid her situation.Yasmeen al-Helo is a mother of one originally from Shujayea, a suburb of Gaza City. She was displaced to Deir el-Balah a year ago. Honestly, my feelings are indescribable. It was a great joy, I cried and was happy at the same time. I cried over the things that happened to us. It wasn’t easy, and there is a lot of sadness. People’s hearts are wounded. The experience was a heavy burden and very difficult.We lost people. Some are missing, some were taken by the [Israeli] occupation and some were martyred. Generally, I’m happy that the bloodshed and violence are going to stop, but at the same time, I’m sad because we’ve lost many dear and precious people. But it happened, and all you can do is pray to God.God willing, the ceasefire won’t collapse and will continue this time. Honestly, I would have preferred an immediate ceasefire because these two difficult days have been worse than the whole of the past year. They want to intensify the bombings and the madness that they are doing.Mohammed al-Mudawwi was receiving physical therapy for a spinal injury that had paralysed his legs at al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when he says he was taken by Israeli forces and accused of involvement in the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks in southern Israel, which he denies. He explains that he was held in detention in January 2024 for about a month, during which he was beaten.The treatment was very bad. As a result of the medical neglect, I developed ulcers. I wasn’t allowed to move. When they would lay me on my right side or my left side, they wouldn’t turn me, and I developed the ulcers because of that. My hands became blue as a result of the constant pressure from the handcuffs.My health deteriorated with the lack of nutrition. They didn’t feed us. We were blindfolded. We had no idea what they were making us drink. They even cut my feet to see if I could feel them or not. When I started to bleed, there was no care to bandage it. I hope that since I’m disabled, I can now be referred for treatment abroad.I’m now optimistic and hopeful because of the ceasefire. Yesterday was the first time I laughed since the war started. This moment is wonderful, especially for my children. God have mercy on the souls of the martyrs.Saleh Aljafarawi is a 27-year-old journalist who was displaced from northern Gaza during the war.

It was a bad experience, one of the worst I’ve lived through during my life. All the scenes and situations I went through during these 467 days will not be erased from my memory. All the situations we faced, we will never be able to forget them.But the feelings of joy today with the end of this war make us forget – even slightly – what we have lived through. May God maintain security and safety for us in the Gaza Strip. After the war ends, we will return to the northern Gaza Strip, even if our homes are destroyed and nothing is left of them. God willing, we will rebuild them.We paid a high price in this war. We lost our colleagues, we lost our families, we lost our friends. We were deprived of the simplest things you can imagine. We were deprived from being with our families for 467 days.Honestly, I lived in fear for every second, especially after hearing what the Israeli occupation was saying about me. I was living life second to second, not knowing what the next second would bring.There’s still two days left [until the ceasefire], and hopefully God will make it easy for us.","‘We lost so many’: Gaza cautiously waits for ceasefire as bombing continues","2025-06-28T09:57:18.701773Z"

He has been threatening to bolt the coalition if this deal came to a vote, saying this was a bad deal for Israel and that his party would need guarantees that Israel will go back to all-out fighting … after the initial phase [of the agreement].”Netanyahu has faced growing domestic pressure to bring home the scores of captives in Gaza, but his far-right coalition partners have threatened to quit his government if he makes too many concessions.Israeli centrist opposition leader Yair Lapid called on Netanyahu not to back out of the ceasefire deal, reiterating his commitment to supporting the agreement.The Israeli outlet Haaretz reported that the Israeli security cabinet will now “convene to approve the Gaza ceasefire deal on Friday morning”, citing a senior Israeli source.“After the security cabinet meeting, the cabinet is expected to vote on the deal. Israeli ministers have not yet been summoned to discuss the deal,” Haaretz reported.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday also expressed confidence that the agreement would go into effect on Sunday.“I am confident, and I fully expect that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday,” Blinken told a news conference in Washington, DC.Meanwhile, Israeli forces intensified their bombardment across the Gaza Strip, with at least 81 people killed in the past 24 hours, the Gaza Health Ministry said on Thursday.Another 200 were wounded, the ministry added.In one attack, two people were killed and six injured after Israeli forces targeted a school sheltering displaced people in the Zeitoun neighbourhood, south of Gaza City, the Palestinian Civil Defence said.One deadly Israeli attack following the announcement of the ceasefire deal killed 20 Palestinians in Jabalia, northern Gaza.Gaza’s Civil Defence said that in the an-Nazla area of Jabalia, the victims included two children and two women.“As we were celebrating the ceasefire announcement, the Israeli warplanes took us by surprise. I woke up to find myself lying in hospital with head injuries,” a boy with a bandaged head told Al Jazeera’s Ibrahim al-Khalili at the site of the attack.“All my brothers and my aunts were killed. I miraculously survived as a Civil Defence member pulled me from under the rubble.”Abdullah Khadr told Al Jazeera that his family had gathered to hear the ceasefire announcement.“As I was about to sleep, I heard a loud explosion. I ran out to find the whole building next to me levelled to the ground; nothing but rubble, dust and smoke rising to the dark skies,” he said.“I heard screams from under the concrete ruins. Some Civil Defence members rushed to our help, and with our bare hands managed to pull out the dead and a few survivors.”Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 46,788 people and wounded 110,453 since October 7, 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities.","Israel’s Netanyahu says no vote on Gaza truce until Hamas accepts terms","2025-06-24T20:04:47.827797Z"

in the dying days of his administration was overshadowed by his political nemesis, Donald Trump.Trump, who will be inaugurated as the 47th US president next week, revealed that a deal had been reached on his Truth Social platform hours before Biden confirmed the agreement in a statement from the White House on Wednesday evening.“This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,” Trump wrote, not hesitating to claim credit for the breakthrough after 15 months of devastating war.Speaking at the White House later, Biden said his diplomatic efforts had “never ceased”, but he acknowledged that his administration had worked with Trump’s team to ensure the US was “speaking with one voice”.Trump had dispatched his incoming Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the ceasefire negotiations in Qatar.Biden, who has been heavily criticised by the progressive flank of the Democratic Party over his unceasing support of Israel, said the deal was “developed and negotiated by my team” and he seemed perplexed that there could be any confusion over who was responsible for the breakthrough.Asked by a reporter if he or Trump deserved credit, Biden replied: “Is that a joke?”While Trump is known for his penchant for bluster and bravado, his involvement in breaking the ceasefire impasse has been widely acknowledged beyond the ranks of his most staunch allies.Mike Casey, a former US State Department official who resigned over Biden’s support for the war, said there was an argument to be made that Israel had timed the deal “as a gift to Trump”.“There’s domestic political considerations for Netanyahu, and it’s essentially not that much different than the deal they could have agreed to in May,” Casey told Al Jazeera.Casey said the Biden administration had “no real negotiations” with the Israelis because they knew the US would ultimately cave in to any of their demands.In Israel, some media coverage went as far as suggesting that Trump’s involvement had been the decisive factor in the breakthrough.The Times of Israel, citing two unnamed Arab officials, reported that the involvement of Trump’s envoy Witkoff in a single round of negotiations had done “more to sway” Netanyahu towards accepting a deal than Biden had done all year.Though not going as far as giving Trump the lion’s share of the credit, Biden officials speaking privately to US media acknowledged that his team had played a significant role.One Biden official told reporters that Witkoff had played a “very important role”, and his partnership with Biden negotiator Brett McGurk had proved “quite effective”, according to a recording of an off-record briefing posted on X by independent journalist, Ken KlippensteinNetanyahu and Witkoff’s offices did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment.Jean-Loup Samaan, a senior research fellow at the Middle East Institute at the National University of Singapore, said it was “highly likely” that the Trump team pressured Netanyahu to accept a deal.“Trump has been clear that he does not want the war to linger while he returns to the Oval Office, especially since the deal will truly begin under his watch,” Samaan told Al Jazeera.“At the same time, one could argue that publicising these pressures likely benefits Netanyahu in his political manoeuvres with his far-right partners in the government,” he said.“This might be a way for [Netanyahu] to convey the message that he had no choice but to show some goodwill to the Trump team to defuse the anger from ministers like Ben-Gvir and Smotrich,” Samaan said, referring to Israeli far-right cabinet members Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir.Alam Saleh, an expert on the Middle East at the Australian National University, said that it was plausible that Witkoff played a significant role in the breakthrough and also that his influence was overblown.“If he was able to leverage specific relationships or bring new ideas to the table, it’s not out of the question that Netanyahu could have been swayed by his position or the dynamics of the meeting,” Saleh told Al Jazeera.“It’s definitely possible that this story is partially true but could also be overblown in terms of its significance,” Saleh said.“Politically, the timing could be aimed at setting the stage for framing the Trump team as more effective on Middle East peace issues – something to keep in mind as this develops.”For Biden, the overshadowing of his role in the Gaza ceasefire recalls the political fortunes of the late US President Jimmy Carter, who served from 1977 to 1981 and died last month at the age of 100.In the dying days of his administration, Carter, a one-term president like Biden, worked with the incoming administration of Ronald Reagan to secure the release of 52 Americans who were being held captive at the US embassy in Iran.The crisis had dominated Carter’s final year in office and contributed to his low public approval before his landslide election defeat.After 444 days inside the embassy, the Americans were flown out of Iran just moments after Reagan was sworn in as president, delivering the new administration a major political victory.","Biden’s role in

He said the ceasefire would take effect on Sunday, January 19.Hamas had earlier told Al Jazeera Arabic that its delegation delivered its approval of a ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement to mediators.But the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that some aspects of the proposal were “unresolved”.“Several clauses in the framework remain unresolved, and we hope that the details will be finalised tonight,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement.Netanyahu is expected to convene his cabinet on Thursday, according to Israeli media reports.The agreement will be implemented over three stages, Sheikh Mohammed said. In an initial six-week phase, Israeli forces would gradually withdraw from central Gaza and Palestinians would be allowed to return to their homes in northern Gaza.Hamas would release 33 Israeli captives over those six weeks, including all female soldiers and civilians, children and the elderly, he said.Talks on the second phase would begin by the 16th day of the first phase, and are expected to include the release of the remaining captives and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the Reuters news agency reported, citing an official briefed on the negotiations.A third phase was expected to include the return of dead bodies and the start of reconstruction in Gaza, Reuters reported.Mediators the United States and Egypt also confirmed that an agreement had been reached, with US President Joe Biden saying the proposal followed “the precise contours” of a plan that he set out in late in May.“It is the result not only of the extreme pressure that Hamas has been under and the changed regional equation after a ceasefire in Lebanon and weakening of Iran – but also of dogged and painstaking American diplomacy,” Biden said.Ahead of the official announcement, US President-elect Donald Trump wrote on social media that the “EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November”.“I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones.”Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi wrote on X that he welcomed the Gaza ceasefire deal and stressed the importance of a fast delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza.The announcement came as the Israeli military continued its deadly attacks across the Gaza Strip.At least 59 people were killed in Israeli attacks on Wednesday, medical sources told Al Jazeera.The situation for the 2.3 million Palestinians living in Gaza remains dire with air and ground attacks continuing and most aid blocked by Israel.The Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Wednesday that Israeli attacks since the start of the war have killed at least 46,707 Palestinians, up by 62 from a day earlier. The number of people wounded has also risen to at least 110,265 people, it said.Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said attacks had been relentless in recent days.“Over the past 72 hours, more people have been targeted inside residential homes,” he said.They included a family targeted in an overnight attack in Deir el-Balah that killed at least 12 people, including children, and an air strike on the Bureij refugee camp, where Israeli bombs killed at least five people.The Israeli army also ordered new forced displacements, this time for Palestinians living in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza, where a siege lasting more than 100 days has so far left more than 5,000 people killed or missing.Israeli shelling on Wednesday cut off electricity to northern Gaza’s Indonesian Hospital as attacks on healthcare facilities are ongoing after the Israeli military torched Kamal Adwan Hospital last month and arrested its director.","Qatar announces Israel and Hamas agreement on Gaza truce, captive exchange","2025-07-15T20:29:56.122286Z"

As then-President Donald Trump downplayed the pandemic’s severity, Biden pledged to increase COVID-19 testing, vaccinate 50 million people in 100 days and get the virus under control.But his campaign promises extended beyond the pandemic. Biden also said he would raise taxes only for the wealthiest Americans, pursue calls for racial justice and adopt policies to mitigate climate change. He said he would forgive all undergraduate student loan debt, lower prescription drug costs and end online sales of firearms and ammunition.Over four years, PolitiFact monitored the progress of 99 campaign promises on the Biden Promise Tracker. PolitiFact reporters tracked each issue and measured outcomes – not intentions or efforts – with final ratings of promise kept, compromise and promise broken.It’s the same system used with the Obameter, which tracked more than 500 of Barack Obama’s promises, and the 2017-2020 iteration of the Trump-O-Meter, which tracked 102 promises from the president-elect’s first term.Our analysis of Biden’s performance on 99 promises found:Biden kept 33 promises.Biden compromised on 32.Biden broke 34 promises.Trump kept about 24 of his promises, compromised on 23 and broke 55. (Obama’s promise meter is not easily compared with Biden and Trump’s trackers because we tracked five times as many promises, and Obama had two terms to work on them.)Our promise meters help voters gauge whether presidents kept their word to the American public. But a higher percentage of promises kept and a smaller percentage of promises broken does not automatically translate into a successful presidency, for several reasons.One is that the issues that dominate in the year before presidents take office may not be the most salient years later. For instance, in 2020, addressing COVID-19 was unavoidable. But by 2024, voters were more interested in inflation and border security.Another caveat is that our promise meters track single, verifiable promises, not the broad goals underlying them. This means a president can get credit on our promise meter for specific pledges but fail to achieve the larger goal underpinning those promises.For instance, Biden pledged to expand affordable housing access, which earned a compromise rating. Although his administration pulled levers to increase access, congressional gridlock stymied Biden’s efforts to pass far-reaching housing assistance. The lack of affordable housing has worsened since Biden took office, largely because of longstanding challenges including low inventory and high demand.Another example is Biden’s promise to end wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East, which also earned a compromise rating. Biden pulled US troops from Afghanistan, but he has not ended wars in the Middle East, especially after Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel and Israel’s military response. Biden’s removal of US troops from Afghanistan was also chaotic and deadly, killing 13 American service members, which significantly damaged his public support.However, promise ratings do reflect a president’s ability to enact an agenda. Here’s a rundown of what Biden did and didn’t accomplish.A president can enact some promises unilaterally with executive orders. Other promises require changing laws, meaning Congress must cooperate – making those promises harder to achieve in today’s highly polarised political environment.Promises Biden kept by signing an executive order include rescinding Trump’s “Muslim bans”, reversing Trump’s family separation policies, rejoining the World Health Organization and reversing the transgender military ban.Biden acted on his own to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court – the Senate confirmed Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to the court in 2022. He also created a bipartisan commission to consider reforms to the court.Biden used executive branch agencies to issue regulations that kept his promises of restoring federal funding for Planned Parenthood and establishing new fuel economy standards.One action that Biden was able to take on his own – the pardon of his son, Hunter Biden – ended up torpedoing one of his own promises. Because of the pardon, we rated his pledge to prevent the White House from interfering in federal investigations and prosecutions, as a promise broken.Sometimes, even a presidential promise that doesn’t require Congress to act can be tricky to keep.For instance, the Biden administration moved to allow the import of prescription drugs from other countries. But Florida, the first state to receive that right from the US Food and Drug Administration, hasn’t exercised it yet. So, that promise rating is a compromise.Obstacles sometimes emerge in foreign policy, too. Biden earned compromises for his promise to join allies to negotiate with North Korea on denuclearisation (which didn’t accomplish much, given North Korean intransigence) and to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal (which foundered amid rising tensions between Iran and the US).The tradeoff with setting policies by executive order is that a future administration can easily overturn them. Biden relied on executive orders when he earned some of his earliest promise-kept ratings, such as those overturning Trump’s controversial immigration policies. Trump has already said that when he returns to office he will reverse policies such as the military transgender ban and fuel economy standards.Biden, a 36-year veteran of the US Senate, secured passage of major legislation during his first two years in office, when Democrats controlled both the House and Senate. But during his final two years, with a divided government, Biden got little done.In 2022, he signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which helped fulfil his promise to reauthorise the Violence Against Women Act; it also earned him a compromise on requiring background checks for all gun sales.Other times, passage required a special Senate procedure called reconciliation that allows a simple majority to pass legislation, rather than requiring 60 votes to move to a final vote. This meant Biden had to negotiate with two centrists in his own Senate caucus – then-Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona – to eke out a majority.Biden signed two laws passed this way: the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.The American Rescue Plan Act was a sweeping package for pandemic relief – it was later criticised for exacerbating pandemic-induced inflation. It also enacted Biden’s promise to help state and local governments prevent budget shortfalls.The Inflation Reduction Act, which passed after inflation had peaked, included provisions on climate change, corporate taxes and healthcare. One provision achieved his pledge to repeal the law barring Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices.Parts of these two laws also enabled Biden to earn some compromise ratings. These include Biden’s promise to offer up to $8,000 tax credit for childcare (it lasted only a year), expand broadband to every American (networks are still being built out) and raise the corporate tax rate to 28 percent. (Biden didn’t secure an across-the-board tax hike for corporations but enacted additional taxes on some of the biggest companies.)Often, however, Biden simply couldn’t get Congress to support his agenda. On day one of Biden’s presidency, he proposed a bill to create a pathway to citizenship for nearly 11 million people. It went nowhere. Biden also failed to get lawmakers’ support for his promises to ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and codify provisions of Roe v Wade, the now-overturned 1973 US Supreme Court case that protected abortion access nationwide.Sometimes, Biden used executive orders to work around Congress, but the courts often stopped those efforts. He pursued forgiving student loan debt in an across-the-board way through executive order, but the US Supreme Court blocked it. Biden then turned to his executive authority to reduce student debt in a more piecemeal way for certain groups.After the Senate failed to follow the House in passing the labour-backed 2021 PRO Act, Biden used his appointment power to name pro-labour members of the National Labor Relations Board, who have since voted to make union organising easier for workers in certain cases.Sometimes, Biden simply backed off his promises. Late in his term, he signed bipartisan legislation to boost the social security benefits of certain state and local workers whose pension payments had been deducted from their monthly payouts. This meant Biden secured a compromise on his promise to expand and increase Social Security benefits, while breaking his pledge to put Social Security on a path to long-run solvency. The bill accelerated Social Security’s insolvency date by six months.With any president, there is a disconnect between what the public thinks a president can do and what can be done.This has been popularised as the “Green Lantern” theory, a term Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan coined. The term comes from a corps of characters in the DC Comics universe who possess rings that create “green energy projections” of enormous power, and if the ring isn’t working, it’s because the users don’t believe in themselves.According to the theory, the public believes “the president can achieve any political or policy objective if only he tries hard enough or uses the right tactics”, either through public communication or legislative acumen. Nyhan considers this misguided.Most voters don’t know about some of the major projects that will eventually benefit them, John J Pitney Jr, an American politics professor at Claremont McKenna College, told us. He pointed to infrastructure spending in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act, which allocated billions in federal funding for projects such as broadband access and roads and bridges.“It takes years or decades to build a project,” Pitney said. “By the time people are actually benefitting from the projects, his presidency will be a difficult question on the (Advanced Placement) government exam.”Biden earned a compromise rating for his pledge to require background checks for all gun sales, and his promise to decriminalise marijuana. But on both issues, he achieved policy results that hadn’t been seen in decades.Frances Lee, a Princeton University political scientist, said Biden was not necessarily the primary factor in the gun bill victories. He harnessed the power of the national shock that followed mass shootings in a Buffalo, New York, supermarket and a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school, which left Republicans “on the wrong side of public opinion”, Lee said. Public opinion had also changed with marijuana, she said, with even Republican states voting to expand its use.Candidates also have incentives to overshoot on promises.“Presidential candidates almost always exaggerate what it’s possible for them to accomplish in office using the powers of the presidency, which are quite weak in formal terms,” Pitney said.Regardless, candidates aim for lofty goals because voters wouldn’t pay much attention if they didn’t, said James M Curry, a University of Utah political scientist.“You can’t excite voters by running on a campaign platform of not trying to accomplish anything big,” Curry said. “This leads to a cycle of over-promising and under-delivering, which absolutely leaves at least some voters perpetually disappointed in presidents, the parties and the Congress.”","Fact check: Did Joe Biden keep these 99 promises?","2025-07-14T21:55:09.540845Z"

It doesn’t matter where you are – if you’re in a school, a shelter, a makeshift camp or even a hospital,” she said.Kamal Adwan Hospital, the most prominent healthcare facility in the north, was torched and destroyed by Israeli forces in late December as part of the siege, and the fate of its arrested director Hussam Abu Safia remains unknown.As Israeli politicians and settler groups openly discuss prospects of building settlements in north Gaza, the siege shows no signs of stopping.Israeli forces killed two Palestinians in the Mukhabarat area in northern Gaza City, witnesses said on Sunday afternoon. Israeli drone fire later killed a young man in the Shati refugee camp.Overnight, there were heavy Israeli attacks on the northwestern areas of Gaza City. At least eight Palestinians were killed on Saturday when the Israeli military directly hit yet another school-turned-shelter in north Gaza’s Jabalia, calling it a Hamas “command and control centre”.Unrelenting attacks are also targeting other areas across the enclave many times each day, with some of the latest hitting the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.The Israeli military on Sunday issued another forced evacuation order, targeting people living in residential blocks in the northern part of Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. Residents were told they would risk being killed if they did not abandon the area.The Gaza Civil Defence announced on Sunday that the Israeli army has killed at least 70 children across the enclave in the past five days alone.The ramp-up of Israeli attacks comes as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu authorised the heads of spy and security agencies Mossad and Shin Bet to travel to Qatar along with other top representatives to advance negotiations on the release of captives held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners.US President Joe Biden spoke with Netanyahu on Sunday, the White House said, as US officials try to reach a Gaza captive and ceasefire deal before Biden leaves office on January 20.Biden “stressed the immediate need for a ceasefire in Gaza and return of the hostages with a surge in humanitarian aid enabled by a stoppage in the fighting under the deal,” it said.Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN’s State of the Union programmde earlier on Sunday that the parties were “very, very close” to reaching a deal, but still had to get it across the finish line.But Israeli leaders have emphasised that the war will not end even if an agreement is reached, and that they will maintain military control of the enclave, even as they continue to occupy the West Bank, large parts of Syria, and areas in southern Lebanon.Despite another large-scale demonstration against the Israeli government and in favour of a deal in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, far-right ministers in the administration remain opposed.Netanyahu was scrambling on Sunday to ensure Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir do not threaten the stability of his ruling coalition by abandoning it in case of a deal.The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire, meanwhile, as the Israeli military continues to block most aid from entering while creating an unsafe situation that has enabled the armed looting of aid convoys.Thousands of families are forced to brave the open or hunker in dilapidated tents amid famine-like conditions across Gaza as Israeli forces keep attacking hospitals and ordering them to evacuate.According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), nearly all of Gaza’s 1.1 million children need mental health and psychosocial support amid the ongoing Israeli bombardment, repeated displacement, and catastrophic living conditions in the winter cold.The UN estimates that at least 19,000 Palestinian children have been orphaned since the start of the war on Gaza that is now in its 16th month.At least 203 journalists have been killed by the Israeli military since the start of the war, including several in the new year.Israel has killed at least 46,565 Palestinians and injured 109,660 so far, with 28 killed in the past day, the Gaza Health Ministry said on Sunday.","‘Ghost area’: 5,000 killed or missing due to Israel’s siege of north Gaza","2025-07-15T20:36:19.765575Z"

I don’t know where our children are. I don’t know anything about them, whether they’re wounded or killed.”Al Jazeera’s Moath al-Kahlout described the scenes at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, where dozens of the wounded were taken, as “bloody” and “dire”, noting the dearth of medical supplies under Israel’s ongoing siege of northern Gaza, which has been in place for more than 80 days.Later on Saturday, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported strikes on various locations across Gaza, including an attack on a house in the Daraj neighbourhood in Gaza City, which killed four Palestinians and wounded several others.Israeli fighter jets also bombed a tent sheltering displaced families in Deir el-Balah, located in the centre of the enclave, killing three people, Wafa reported.Additional strikes reportedly killed one person near the Bureij refugee camp, also in central Gaza, and another in the southern town of Khan Younis.The intensified attacks came as Egypt, Qatar and the United States made renewed efforts to reach a deal to halt fighting in Gaza and free remaining Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.On Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, who had travelled to Qatar earlier in the week.Witkoff had reassured Egyptian and Qatari mediators that the US would continue to work towards a fair deal to end the war soon, said Egyptian security sources cited by news agency Reuters.After the meeting, Netanyahu dispatched a high-level delegation, including the head of the Israeli Mossad intelligence agency, to Qatar in order to “advance” talks, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office.“There are a lot of moving parts here,” said Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from the Jordanian capital, Amman.“Donald Trump said that he would be quite aggressive in trying to get a ceasefire if it didn’t happen before he took office … But you have to remember that there are tough sticking points on each side,” she said.“The Israelis say that they’re not going to end the war, and Hamas says that they want to see a comprehensive ceasefire that sees an end to the war and a withdrawal of Israeli troops.“And you also have the Israeli public, which is constantly demonstrating against Benjamin Netanyahu, against the Israeli government, saying that he’s neither capable nor willing to make a deal fifteen months into this war,” she said.Families of Israeli captives welcomed Netanyahu’s decision to dispatch the officials, with the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters describing it as an “historic opportunity”.As mediators prepare for more ceasefire talks, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said that Palestinians under attack in Gaza were also contending with severe food shortages, with Israel continuing to ignore United Nations demands on lifting its restrictions on supplies entering the Strip.“We’re seeing children with empty pots every single day searching for community kitchens, talking with families saying they are barely able to feed their children one meal per day,” said Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah.“It’s not only the continuous air strikes, but also malnutrition is killing Palestinians in the Gaza Strip,” she said.Vibe Klarup, head of Amnesty Denmark, said that Israel was committing “genocide”.“When we say Israel is committing genocide, it is not an opinion, it’s a conclusion on the basis of a legal, thorough analysis,” she told The European Palestinian Network conference in Copenhagen.“It is increasingly impossible to stay alive in the Gaza Strip … Our role as people is to stop the genocide,” she added.At least 46,537 people have been killed in Israel’s war on Gaza since October 7, 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities.","Israel steps up Gaza attacks amid renewed ceasefire push","2025-06-28T10:49:39.319370Z"

It did not provide an estimate of Palestinian fighters among the dead.That toll represented 2.9 percent of Gaza’s pre-war population, “or approximately one in 35 inhabitants,” the study said.The toll was only for deaths from traumatic injuries, so did not include deaths from a lack of healthcare or food, or the thousands of missing believed to be buried under rubble.Israel’s war in Gaza has killed at least 46,006 Palestinians and wounded 109,378 since October 7, 2023, the territory’s Health Ministry says.The war began on October 7 2023, after Hamas-led attacks across the border with Israel killed at least 1,139 people and led to more than 200 people being taken captive.In the first months of the war, the official Health Ministry death count was based entirely on bodies that arrived in hospitals.It later came to include other methods, including distributing an online survey to Palestinian people inside and outside the Gaza Strip, who were asked to provide data on their ID numbers, names, age at death, sex, location of death, and reporting source.The Lancet study noted that the Palestinian Health Ministry’s capacity for maintaining electronic death records had previously proven reliable, but has currently deteriorated under Israel’s military campaign, which has included raids on hospitals and other healthcare facilities and disruptions to digital communications.On Thursday, Gaza health officials said the Al-Aqsa, Nasser and European hospitals are at risk of imminent closure, after repeated Israeli attacks and blockades of supplies. The Kamal Adwan, Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals have already been forced to close.Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, said that many deaths were going unreported in the north of the Gaza Strip, with bodies being buried in the yards of homes or in the streets, as victims from a renewed Israeli offensive in the area cannot be brought to besieged hospitals.“The entire healthcare system in the northern part of the Strip is out of service, without any proper mechanism for recording the number of casualties in the area,” he said.“It is increasingly difficult to keep track of mass killings during Israel’s relentless attacks.”He said the Al-Aqsa Hospital was now being overwhelmed by a recent influx of injured civilians, many of them women and children.“Doctors are reporting an acute shortage of basic supplies, including surgical tools, antibiotics and painkillers,” he said.Reporting from Deir-el Balah on Friday, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said the Israeli military is escalating its attacks on residential areas.“Medical teams in al-Awda Hospital continue to report that the Israeli army is going on with bulldozing all residential homes in the vicinity of the hospital amid more deterioration taking place among medical cases left there, and it could be a sign of further Israeli escalation taking place within the coming days,” he said.Israel has repeatedly said it goes to great lengths to avoid civilians deaths and accuses Hamas of using hospitals as cover for its operations, which the group has denied.","Deaths from Israeli attacks in Gaza undercounted by 41 percent, study finds","2025-06-24T20:37:18.297974Z"

Aid groups have repeatedly accused Israel of stifling aid access.The IFRC said that dire winter weather conditions were “exacerbating the unbearable conditions” in Gaza, with many families left “clinging on to survival in makeshift camps, without even the most basic necessities, such as blankets”.The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), meanwhile, reported that at least 74 children had been killed in Gaza in the first week of 2025, “suffering from attacks, deprivation, and increasing exposure to the cold”.The figure included eight infants and newborns who have died from hypothermia in recent days.More than a million children are among Gaza’s displaced, with many living in makeshift tents with little protection from the elements, the agency said.As the fighting rages in Gaza, Israeli raids have continued across the occupied West Bank.On Wednesday, the Commission of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society (PPS) said 45 Palestinians have been arrested since Tuesday night across the governorates of Hebron, Nablus, Tubas, Tulkarem, Ramallah, and Jerusalem.In Bethlehem, several teachers and students suffered injuries after inhaling tear gas that Israeli soldiers launched at the Kisan School east of Bethlehem, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.The tear gas was reportedly a response to some students throwing stones at Israeli military vehicles.Meanwhile, three Palestinians, including two children, were killed by an Israeli air strike on the town of Tammun on Wednesday in Tubas governorate.The killed children were identified as nine-year-old Rida Bisharat and 10-year-old Hamza Bisharat by the Palestinian Foreign Ministry. It described the strike as a “heinous crime”.The ministry further said Israel’s “application of its aggressive policies in the West Bank” was “in flagrant violation of international law and the Geneva Conventions”.As the fighting continued, mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and the United States were pushing forward with efforts to broker an agreement between Israel and Hamas that would see a ceasefire and exchange of Israeli captives held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Speaking from Paris, France on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken maintained that an agreement was “very close”.However, past efforts to secure a trace have repeatedly failed, with both Hamas and Israel accusing each other of changing the terms.Washington has also been criticised for not imposing more leverage on its “ironclad” ally Israel, to which it provides billions of dollars in military aid.Meanwhile, US President-elect Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy appointee, Steve Witkoff, on Tuesday said he would travel to Doha, Qatar to join the negotiations. He expressed hope that an agreement would be reached before Trump takes office on January 20.For his part, speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Trump told reporters that “all hell will break out” if a deal is not reached by the time he takes office.

Casualties, including children, were also reported in the al-Mawasi area near Khan Younis.The Palestinian Civil Defence said that it retrieved the bodies of three people who were killed in Israeli bombing in Nuseirat and another person in Khirbet al-Adas, north of Rafah.The Gaza Health Ministry had said earlier on Monday that at least 49 people were killed over the previous 24 hours, bringing the Palestinian death toll from the war to 45,854.Israel has been killing dozens of Palestinians in Gaza daily since the war broke out in October 2023. It has also imposed a suffocating blockade on the territory and displaced nearly its entire population.Harsh winter conditions have added to the woes of Palestinians sheltering in makeshift tents, already contending with hunger and lack of medical care.The Gaza Government Media Office said on Monday that eight displaced Palestinians have died due to severe cold in recent weeks, warning that the number could rise amid dire conditions in the territory.“We hold the Israeli occupation fully responsible for the deterioration of humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip as well as the American administration and countries that have supported and participated in the genocide,” the office said in a statement.It called on international organisations and Arab and Muslim countries to urgently intervene to save civilians in Gaza.The World Food Programme (WFP) on Monday accused Israeli forces of firing at one of its convoys a day earlier.It described the shooting, which did not result in casualties, as “unacceptable”.“The World Food Programme strongly condemns the horrifying incident on January 5, when a clearly marked WFP convoy was shot at by Israeli forces near the Wadi Gaza checkpoint, putting the lives of our staff at tremendous risk and leaving the vehicles immobilised,” WFP said in a statement.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant are facing arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court (ICC) over alleged war crimes in Gaza, including using “starvation as a method of warfare”.Against the backdrop of the violence and humanitarian crisis in Gaza, diplomatic efforts have continued to reach a ceasefire deal that would lead to the release of Israeli captives held by Hamas and other Palestinian groups.Hamas officials told several media outlets on Monday that the group is willing to free 34 Israeli captives in the first stage of the deal that would also see the release of an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.It is unclear how many of the Israeli captives on the initial list are still alive. Hamas has said that Israeli bombardment has killed several captives since the start of the war.Israeli media outlets reported on Monday that Mossad chief David Barnea postponed a trip to Doha to finalise the deal while Israel awaits Hamas’s response to a proposal.Incoming United States President Donald Trump reiterated on Monday that “there would be hell to pay” if the captives are not released by the time he returns to the White House for a second term on January 20.","Israeli attacks target Palestinians across Gaza amid ceasefire talks","2025-07-15T20:45:57.022706Z"

United Nations experts and several rights groups have also said that Israel is carrying out a genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.“The terrorism in [the West Bank] and the terrorism from Gaza and Iran is the same terrorism – and it must be defeated,” Smotrich added on Monday, according to the Times of Israel.Since the start of the war on Gaza in October 2023, Israel has intensified its crackdown on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, killing hundreds of people. The past year has also seen an uptick in settler attacks.Palestinian gunmen – some associated with Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad – have also carried out attacks against Israeli soldiers and settlers in the occupied territory in recent months.Abu Obeida, the spokesperson of Hamas’s Qassam Brigades, hailed Monday’s shooting, saying that efforts by Israel and its agents to stop the “heroes of the West Bank” from backing Gaza are “destined to fail”.“The enemy must know that it will never enjoy security until our people have security,” Abu Obeida said in a statement.Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut said that a manhunt for the suspects in Monday’s attack is under way across the occupied West Bank.Reporting from Amman, Jordan because the Palestinian Authority has suspended Al Jazeera’s operations in the occupied West Bank, Salhut said Israeli authorities have closed several roads and blocked off many areas in their search.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israeli forces will capture the attackers.“We will reach the despicable murderers and bring them to justice and everyone who helped them,” he wrote in a post on X. “No one will be spared.”The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled in an advisory opinion in July that Israel’s presence in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is unlawful and must end “as rapidly as possible”.Alon Liel, the former director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said that amid the escalating violence in the region, many Israelis are accepting that there is “no alternative” to fighting, particularly among younger people.“It’s a very dangerous attitude that is developing here,” Liel told Al Jazeera on Monday.“We need a very fundamental change in the thinking of Israel and maybe a fundamental change in the attitude of the international community [towards] the conflict, too.”","Three Israelis killed in shooting attack in occupied West Bank","2025-06-28T10:04:45.625901Z"

Israel has prevented even aid groups from supplying basic food items to the area.“I don’t know if I will write to you again. I keep what I have written and am writing. Maybe it will come to light one day. I refuse a cheap death. I curse the murderer,” Hijazi wrote on Facebook in August last year.“Let us in this bottom that we have finally reached, arm ourselves with patience and prayer, and count the days we have lived as a historic achievement, while awaiting what is coming with a broken heart, an extinguished eye, a head held high, and a spirit that fights until the end of the road.”It was not immediately clear whether Hijazi was working for a specific media organisation when he died.Since the beginning of its war on Gaza on October 7, 2023, Israel has killed at least 220 journalists and media workers, including Hijazi.The Health Ministry reported on Sunday that at least 88 Palestinians had been killed and 208 others injured in Gaza in the past 24 hours.Meanwhile, another baby died from the cold in Gaza, as displaced Palestinians lack warm clothes and are forced to live in tents that provide little protection from the weather.The child’s mother told Al Jazeera that her baby, Yousef, was born healthy, but he became the eighth infant to die in Gaza in recent days due to the cold.“They didn’t give a single moment to feel happy with my baby,” she said. “He slept next to me and in the morning I found him frozen and dead. I don’t know what to say. No one can feel my misery. No one in the world can understand our catastrophic situation.”The latest fatalities bring the death toll of Palestinians killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza to at least 45,805 since October 2023, while an estimated 109,064 have been injured.Among those slain in Israeli strikes across Gaza on Sunday were three Palestinians who were living in a tent in Deir el-Balah, according to Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from central Gaza.A family of 15 people was also buried under the rubble in the northwest of Gaza City, following a separate strike, Mahmoud reported.“The Palestinian Civil Defence is doing its best to remove bodies from under the rubble, but has only removed four of the family members,” he said.“It’s estimated there are at least 15 family members under the three-storey building that was flattened to the ground.“These repeated attacks – deliberate against families – continue to unfold, causing more tragedies among Palestinians.”In the last three days, Israeli forces have killed more than 200 people in Gaza, Mahmoud noted.The last few remaining hospitals across Gaza are now overwhelmed, he added.At the emergency department at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir el-Balah, many people were left on the floor and others were waiting to be admitted into the operating theatre, Mahmoud said.“By the time it’s their turn, it’s too late – they have already bled to death. [Many] burns are quite severe, and no pain medication is available at the hospital,” he said.“There’s a silent death going on. In the past weeks, due to the ongoing attacks, people are dying quietly because of the lack of medical supplies.”On Sunday, the Israeli military claimed that it had struck more than 100 “terror targets” in the Gaza Strip over the past two days. Several of the strikes targeted sites from which Palestinian fighters had been firing projectiles into Israel in recent days, the military said.The latest violence in Gaza comes as indirect negotiations for a captive release deal resumed in Qatar.Mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been engaged for months in efforts to strike a deal to end the war and secure the release of dozens of captives still held in Gaza.Israel has detained more than 10,000 Palestinians since launching its devastating war, which has brought it global condemnation. Rights groups have termed Israel’s military offensive as a genocide, while the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the top United Nations court, said in March 2024 that the Israeli operation “plausibly” amounted to genocide.Seperately, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.","‘I refuse a cheap death’: Israel kills Palestinian journalist in Gaza","2025-06-28T10:49:14.271653Z"

Among them were three children who died when their home was struck in the vicinity of al-Shamaa mosque in Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighbourhood.In southern Gaza, the Civil Defence said its teams recovered the bodies of two Palestinians who were killed in an attack on the Khirbet al-Adas area, near Rafah, while two others were injured and taken to the nearby Nasser Hospital.Medical sources in the enclave told Al Jazeera at least 52 Palestinians were killed across the Gaza Strip on Friday.Israeli jets destroyed buildings in the centre of the Strip, killing journalist Omar al-Diraoui in his home in az-Zawayda – the second journalist to be killed in 24 hours.On Thursday, it was confirmed that photographer Hassan al-Qishaoui had been killed in an Israeli attack.Following the deaths, Gaza’s Government Media Office revised the number of journalists killed in the enclave since the beginning of the nearly 15-month war to 202.Meanwhile, Israel pressed on with a renewed military offensive in the north of Gaza, with Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reporting that Israeli forces ordered the immediate evacuation of the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahiya.At least 25 patients were trapped inside the hospital, along with medical staff, according to people inside who spoke to Al Jazeera. Israeli soldiers have surrounded the facility and are firing at it, they said.Hamas slammed Israel’s attack on the hospital in a statement, calling it a “war crime” and part of Israel’s ongoing “genocide” in Gaza.Meanwhile, Israelis also woke up to an attack early on Friday morning, with the army intercepting a missile reportedly fired from Yemen, which had set off air raid sirens in Jerusalem and central Israel.As the attacks continued, a new round of indirect talks on a ceasefire in Gaza resumed in Qatar’s capital, Doha, a senior Hamas official said.Basem Naim stressed the group’s seriousness in seeking to reach a deal as soon as possible.The new talks will focus on agreeing on a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, he said, as well as ensuring the return of displaced families to their homes.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said earlier that he had authorised a delegation from the Mossad intelligence agency, the Shin Bet internal security agency and the military to continue negotiations in Qatar.Sami al-Arian, director of the Centre for Islam and Global Affairs at Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University, said Hamas could be willing to walk back one of its key demands – the immediate withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza.“There has been a lot of pressure from the mediators – particularly the Qataris and Egyptians – to be flexible on these terms,” he told Al Jazeera.“They have assured the resistance, Hamas and other groups, that eventually Israel will withdraw,” he said.But Ori Goldberg, a Tel Aviv-based political analyst, told Al Jazeera he does not see any grounds for optimism that a ceasefire will be agreed upon at the talks, amid a lack of significant international pressure being applied on either side.“To the best of my knowledge, Hamas is interested in a deal but not excessively, because its recruitment rates are rising the longer Israel continues its genocide in Gaza,” he said.“Certainly, the Israeli public is interested in a deal. [But] the Israeli government? Not so much – the war serves its interests,” he said.Key mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been attempting to secure a lasting deal in indirect talks for months.So far, 45,658 Palestinians have been killed and 108,583 wounded in Gaza since Israel began its war on the enclave on October 7, 2023.The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90 percent of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times.Hamas-led forces killed some 1,139 people in Israel in attacks on October 7, 2023, and took about 250 captives.About 100 captives are still in Gaza, although at least a third of them are believed to be dead.","Israeli attacks kill dozens in Gaza as ceasefire talks resume in Qatar","2025-07-15T20:37:59.075569Z"

At least 10 other Palestinians were missing and believed to be under the rubble.“Fifteen people were martyred and more than 20 were injured in a massacre after midnight in a house where displaced people were living in the town of Jabalia,” Gaza civil defence agency’s spokesperson Mahmoud Basal said.A relative of some of the victims said the first responders were still searching for survivors. “The house has turned into a pile of debris,” said Jibri Abu Warda.“It was a massacre with body parts of children and women scattered everywhere. They were sleeping when the house was bombed,” Abu Warda said. “No one knows why they targeted the house. They were all civilians.”An attack overnight in Bureij refugee camp killed a woman and a child, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies.In Gaza City’s Shujaiya neighbourhood, a strike on a residential home that belonged to the al-Suweirki family killed six people, including two children and a woman, the civil defence said in a statement.Another strike in Khan Younis killed three people, according to the Nasser Hospital and the European Hospital, which received the bodies.The civil defence agency said it has been finding it hard to respond to distress calls from families because of intense Israeli bombardment over the past few days.“Those besieged in the areas of incursion suffer from a complete lack of livelihood. The suspension of our services has completely affected the lives of citizens who are exposed to Israeli bombardment,” a civil defence member told Al Jazeera.“The New Year arrives in Gaza, not with joy or hope, but with the boom of fighter jets, drones, and eardrum-shattering explosion sounds,” said Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza.Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 45,553 Palestinians and wounded 108,379 since October 7, 2023, Gaza’s Health Ministry said on Wednesday.“It’s not just Israeli bombs and the forced displacement that are overwhelming Palestinians, but also the severe cold weather. Many of them are in tents, lacking warm winter clothing, and they are trying to cope with it all by resorting to primitive means of heating,” Abu Azzoum said.Days of heavy rain have flooded hundreds of makeshift shelters across the enclave, piling more misery on forcibly displaced Palestinians as Israel continues to restrict entry of humanitarian aid. At least six infants have died from the cold in recent days.“For three days, we haven’t slept out of fear that our children would fall sick because of the winter, as well as fear of missiles falling on us,” said Samah Darabieh, a woman displaced from central Gaza’s Deir el-Balah and now living in Beit Lahiya.Throughout their 15-month assault on Gaza, Israeli forces have routinely besieged and attacked medical facilities housing both patients and displaced families.“Two days ago, they bombed Al-Wafaa hospital, which is behind us, and the shrapnel dropped here,” Darabieh said.Last week, Israeli forces raided north Gaza’s Kamal Adwan Hospital, forcibly evacuating medical staff and patients from the facility and arresting the hospital’s director, Dr Hussam Abu Safia, whose whereabouts remain unknown.Kamal Adwan Hospital is “suffering from a stifling siege, as the operating and surgery departments, laboratory, maintenance, ambulance units and warehouses have been completely burned”, the Gaza Health Ministry said.The United Nations has said Israel’s attacks on Gaza’s hospitals have pushed its healthcare system to “the brink of total collapse”, and Israeli justifications that Palestinian armed groups use health facilities are “vague, broad” and “contradicted by publicly available information”.Israel’s continuing assault on Gaza has drawn growing international condemnation, with officials and rights groups labelling the attacks and blocking of aid deliveries as acts of genocide.In November, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its deadly war on Gaza.","Israeli attacks kill at least 26 Palestinians across Gaza on New Year’s Day","2025-07-15T20:38:23.018993Z"

It’s also very expensive to afford any nylon or any equipment or tools to cover your tent and even winter clothes [and] blankets.”In parallel, Israel has attacked two hospitals – al-Wafaa and al-Ahli – in Gaza City. The bombing of al-Wafaa on Sunday killed seven people and critically wounded others, according to the Palestinian Civil Defence.A witness at the scene of the al-Wafaa bombing described seeing bodies “ripped to pieces”.

Among them was its director, Dr Hussam Abu Safia.The military has not disclosed Abu Safia’s whereabouts. However, CNN reported on Monday that he was being kept at the Sde Teiman army base, which is also a detention facility in the Negev desert in southern Israel. It quoted two recently released Palestinian prisoners who had seen him and heard his name being read out.On Monday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, called for Abu Safia’s immediate release.Tedros, who last week escaped an Israeli strike on Yemen’s main airport that he said hit metres away from him, said in a post on X that hospitals in Gaza had become “battlegrounds” and the health system was “under severe threat”.“We repeat: stop attacks on hospitals. People in Gaza need access to health care. Humanitarians need access to provide health aid. Ceasefire!” he said.Meanwhile, Israeli media released a video of the moments before Abu Safia was detained by Israeli forces. The footage captured his efforts to move hundreds of patients and medical staff to safety after the Israeli military issued a 15-minute warning to leave the hospital.Reporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said the military had released the footage in a bid to depict their operations as “incredibly targeted, precise and humane”.“But later on, we have heard from eyewitnesses … quite the opposite in terms of the humiliation [and] bad treatment that they received at the hands of the Israeli soldiers [and] the brutal beatings that they have witnessed during the military operations,” he added.Since Israel’s war began in October 2023, Gaza’s residents have endured severe shortages of electricity, drinking water, food and medical services as the vast majority of them have been forced out of their homes and displaced – many repeatedly.The Israeli genocide in Gaza has killed at least 45,541 Palestinians and wounded 108,338.

It arrested more than 240 people from the hospital premises.Since October 6, Israel’s operations in Gaza have focused on the north, where the military says its land and air offensive aims to prevent Hamas from regrouping.Zaher Sahloul, the president of MedGlobal, said in a statement that Abu Safia’s arrest was “unjust and a violation of international humanitarian law”.“His arrest is not only unjust – it is a violation of international humanitarian law, which upholds the protection of medical personnel in conflict zones. MedGlobal urgently calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Dr Abu [Safia].”Agnes Callamard, the secretary-general of Amnesty International, said Abu Safia is considered a human rights defender by Front Line Defenders, an Irish-based organisation that works to protect people who are “at risk for their peaceful and legitimate human rights work”.The raid was also the latest on a hospital during the war, in which Israel targeted healthcare complexes.“The systematic dismantling of the health system and a siege for over 80 days on north Gaza puts the lives of the 75,000 Palestinians remaining in the area at risk,” the UN health agency said in a statement.Dr Ali Elaydi, an orthopaedic surgeon originally from Gaza, says Israel’s raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital and the arrest of Dr Abu Safia are aimed at emptying the north of the enclave of its residents.“It essentially robs the entire population of northern Gaza of any sustainable medical care. I believe this is truly intentional to force the people out of northern Gaza,” Elaydi told Al Jazeera from the US city of Dallas.“It is systematic. [The Israelis] have decided that without medical care, they [the Palestinians in north Gaza] would have to evacuate.”“It is a warning to every other physician to not speak out for their patients.”On Friday, Hamas dismissed Israel’s assertion that its fighters had operated from the hospital throughout the 15-month Gaza war, saying no fighters had been in the hospital.WHO said the Kamal Adwan Hospital’s remaining 15 critical patients, 50 caregivers and 20 health workers were transferred on Friday to the nearby Indonesian Hospital, which it described as “destroyed and non-functional”.It said WHO would undertake an urgent mission to the Indonesian Hospital on Sunday, partly to move the critical patients to Gaza City.On Sunday, an Israeli attack on the upper floor of al-Wafaa Hospital in Gaza City killed at least seven people and wounded others, some critically, according to Gaza’s civil defence.“The seven Palestinians who were killed in al-Wafaa Hospital are obviously patients because the hospital treats the elderly,” Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza.“And after the war started, it started admitting people with chronic diseases and functioned as a rehabilitation centre.”The Israeli military claimed the attack on the hospital targeted a Hamas “command and control centre”.Abu Safia, who is a paediatrician by training, has refused multiple Israeli orders to evacuate Kamal Adwan Hospital.He was briefly arrested and released when Israeli forces stormed Kamal Adwan in late October.During that same operation, Israeli forces killed Abu Safia’s son, Ibrahim, in a drone attack on the gate of the hospital.Abu Safia was wounded by shrapnel from another Israeli attack on the hospital on November 23, but he continued his work, keeping the world informed on the developments in the hospital.This is not the first time the Israeli forces have attacked a hospital and medical professionals. Adnan al-Bursh, a prominent Palestinian orthopaedic surgeon and the head of orthopaedics at al-Shifa, Gaza’s largest medical facility before it was destroyed, was killed reportedly due to torture in an Israeli prison.He was working at the al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza in December when he and other medics were arrested by the Israeli army.","Calls for the release of Gaza hospital director detained by Israel","2025-06-28T10:06:05.998117Z"

We cannot allow a generation of children to become collateral damage to the world’s unchecked wars,” the director said. The proportion of children living in areas of conflict has doubled – from about 10 percent in the 1990s to almost 19 percent today, UNICEF said.According to the report, 47.2 million children were displaced due to conflict and violence by the end of 2023.The trends for 2024 indicate a further increase in displacement because various conflicts have intensified, including in Haiti, Lebanon, Myanmar, the Palestinian territories and Sudan.Additionally, in the latest available data, from 2023, the UN verified a record 32,990 grave violations against 22,557 children – the highest number since UN Security Council-mandated monitoring began, UNICEF said.There is an overall upward trend in the number of grave violations, with this year likely to see another increase, as “thousands of children have been killed and injured in Gaza, and in Ukraine”, the agency said.Sexual violence against children has surged, their education has been affected, children’s malnutrition rates have risen and armed conflicts have taken a larger toll on children’s mental health, UNICEF also reported.“The world is failing these children. As we look towards 2025, we must do more to turn the tide and save and improve the lives of children,” Russell said.In Gaza – where the Israeli military has killed more women and children in the past year than in any recent conflict over a single year, Oxfam reported in September – the ongoing war is a “nightmare” for children, UNICEF Communication Specialist Rosalia Bollen said last week at a media briefing.“Children in Gaza are cold, sick and traumatised,” Bollen said last Friday.About 96 percent of women and children in Gaza cannot meet their basic nutritional needs, she said, lamenting the lack of aid able to reach children in the Strip.“Gaza must be one of the most heartbreaking places on Earth for humanitarians. Every small effort to save a child’s life is undone by fierce devastation,” said Bollen.“For over 14 months, children have been at the sharp edge of this nightmare.”Bollen said that many children in the besieged enclave don’t have winter clothes, have to resort to searching through rubbish for provisions and are plagued with diseases.She urged the use of political capital and diplomatic leverage to push for the evacuation of injured children and their parents to leave Gaza and seek medical care in East Jerusalem or elsewhere.“This war should haunt every one of us. Gaza’s children cannot wait,” she pressed.","One in six children live in conflict zones this year: UNICEF","2025-06-28T10:38:06.692996Z"

He said contact with the hospital had been lost.Israel’s war in Gaza has killed at least 45,436 Palestinians and wounded 108,038 since October 7, 2023, according to figures released on Friday by Gaza’s Health Ministry.An estimated 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks that day and more than 200 were taken captive.","Health worker displaced by Israeli attacks in Gaza dies of ‘extreme cold’","2025-07-14T21:45:07.671998Z"

May there be a ceasefire, may the hostages be released and aid be given to the people worn out by hunger and by war,” he said.Israel has killed at least 45,361 Palestinians in its war on Gaza and wounded 107,803 since October 7, 2023, the day a Hamas-led operation was launched into Israel during which 1,139 people were killed and about 200 were taken captive.Israel’s purported “retaliation” has displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza and left much of the enclave in ruins.The 88-year-old, celebrating the 12th Christmas of his pontificate, called for an end to conflicts, political, social or military, in places including Lebanon, Mali, Mozambique, Haiti, Venezuela and Nicaragua.“I invite every individual, and all people of all nations … to become pilgrims of hope, to silence the sounds of arms and overcome divisions,” the pope said.Speaking from the central balcony of Saint Peter’s Basilica to thousands of people in the square below, the pope said: “May the sound of arms be silenced in war-torn Ukraine.”He also called for “gestures of dialogue and encounter, in order to achieve a just and lasting peace”.Francis was criticised by Ukrainian officials this year when he said the country should have the courage of the “white flag” to negotiate an end to the war with Russia.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously ruled out engaging in peace talks without the restoration of Ukraine’s pre-war borders. But Zelenskyy has shown an increasing willingness to enter negotiations in the weeks since Donald Trump’s re-election as US president.Earlier in December, Zelenskyy raised the idea of a diplomatic settlement that would involve a “freezing” of the current battle lines and the deployment of foreign troops in Ukraine. Russia has demanded that Ukraine abandon its ambitions to join the NATO military alliance.The head of the Catholic Church also extended his call for a silencing of arms in Sudan, which has been ravaged by 20 months of brutal civil war where millions are under the threat of famine.“May the Son of the Most High sustain the efforts of the international community to facilitate access to humanitarian aid for the civilian population of Sudan and to initiate new negotiations for a ceasefire,” he said.Earlier this week, a United Nations-backed global hunger-monitoring group said famine was spreading in Sudan.The war began in April 2023 when long-simmering tensions between the military and paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, before spreading to the rest of the country.The conflict has been marked by atrocities, including ethnically motivated killings and rapes, according to the UN and human rights groups.The International Criminal Court is investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.","At Christmas, Pope calls for ‘silence of arms’, says Gaza situation ‘grave’","2025-06-28T10:38:16.719046Z"

Some called me, happy about the eclipse of the Syrian regime, and others were sad over such a scenario. We’re a highly divided society,” said Saleh.Al-Assad’s defeat feels personal to Houthi supporters who see themselves as part of a broader, Iran-led, “axis of resistance” to Israel and the United States.Under al-Assad, Syria was considered a key part of the axis and a route for the transfer of weapons between Iran, Iraq and Lebanon.Abdulrahman Ali, a 40-year-old in Sanaa, says the demise of the former Syrian regime is a “massive loss”.“When I watched the news on the fall of Damascus to Turkey-backed Syrian militant groups, I cried. Personally, I don’t care about Bashar. What matters is the continued strength of the axis of resistance,” Ali told Al Jazeera.The Houthis, who held an armed takeover of Sanaa in September 2014 and then, in 2015, forced out the internationally-recognised government, are part of Iran’s ‘axis of resistance’, which includes the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, the Popular Mobilisation Forces in Iraq, and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. The former Syrian government was also considered part of the axis.The Houthi takeover prompted a war as the ousted government and regional allies – led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – tried to wrest back control of Yemen.In April 2022, a United Nations-sponsored ceasefire halted the fighting, but control remains divided among various groups, including the Houthis, and the Yemeni government and the Southern Transitional Council in the south and east.Today, pro-Houthi Yemenis like Ali say the war may well start up again in Yemen.“The current scenario in Syria may entice anti-Ansar Allah groups to launch a war,” he said, using the official name for the Houthis. “This will throw us into a new cycle of violence.”The Houthi leadership is not scared of a renewal of fighting, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a senior member of the Houthi Supreme Political Council in Sanaa, said in a televised interview on December 12.He added that the Houthis were ready should the “aggression” on Yemen resume, using a term the Houthis employ for attacks by the forces pitted against them.“The Yemeni people do not care about threats,” al-Houthi added. “Any foolishness committed by the Israeli enemy against Yemen will trigger the [military] operations of the Yemeni armed forces.”On the other side of the Yemeni divide are millions opposed to the Houthis who see al-Assad’s fall as a victory for freedom and a defeat for tyranny.“Finally, the Syrian people have justice,” said Faisal Mohammed, a 39-year-old teacher in Taiz, a city largely held by anti-Houthi forces that suffered for years as a result of a siege imposed by the rebel group. “Assad’s fall gives us hope that the Arab world can rise above oppression.”Faisal Mohammed sees events in Syria as a message to the Houthis.“The Assads’ dynastic rule has crumbled after 54 years… no matter how long the Houthis continue, they will meet the same destiny.”With Iranian support over the past decade, including weapons and experts, the Houthis have fought numerous battles against pro-government forces in Yemen and tightened their grip in large swaths of Yemen.The group has appeared secure, militarily and politically, and Saudi Arabia has for years been looking for a way out of its involvement in Yemen, appearing close to a deal with the Houthis at times. The anti-Houthi camp, on the other hand, has often appeared weak and divided, with many anti-Houthi Yemenis disappointed with the failures of their representatives.In fact, it had appeared that the Yemeni government would have to acquiesce to some form of deal with the Houthis or be frozen out by Saudi Arabia.However, events in the wider region, including the general weakness of Iran and its allies as a result of their conflict with Israel, have given many in the anti-Houthi camp hope that things have changed.“Hezbollah has suffered huge losses at the hands of Israel, and Assad’s regime is eliminated. Iran could do nothing,” Faisal Mohammed said. “Therefore, the Houthis will likely meet a similar destiny, and this means the Iranian presence in Yemen will be uprooted.”Mohammed Abdu, a Taiz-based Yemeni journalist with a focus on politics and war, told Al Jazeera that a fight to dislodge the Houthis would be “challenging”.“Houthi military force and prowess is huge. They have thousands of fighters and weapon arsenals,” he said.“However, a collective effort by the Yemeni government and its regional and international allies can quicken the Houthi collapse.”For some Yemenis, however, al-Assad’s fall serves as a warning more than anything else.“Syria shows us that removing a dictator is not the end of the story,” said Yunis Saleh, a shopkeeper in Sanaa. “What matters is what comes next. If Syria does not find peace, we will face the same endless cycle of violence.”Yemenis weary of war echo this sentiment, regardless of their political affiliations. For them, al-Assad’s fall is a reminder of the need for a comprehensive solution to Yemen’s decade-long crisis.The war between the Saudi Arabian-backed Yemeni government and the Iran-aligned Houthis has caused a humanitarian catastrophe.The World Health Organization (WHO) said in March this year that as the conflict in Yemen enters its 10th year, more than half of the country’s population is in desperate need of aid.An estimated 17.8 million people require health assistance, 50 percent of them children; 4.5 million people are displaced; and more than 3,700 schools have been damaged or repurposed, the UN said.Abdulsalam Mohammed, the head of the Yemeni Abaad Studies and Research Center, told Al Jazeera that the Houthis’ actions in the waterways around Yemen, where the group has attacked ships ostensibly in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza under attack by Israel, had led to international isolation, and a campaign of air attacks led by the United States and the United Kingdom.The Houthis have also conducted missile and drone attacks on Israel, leading to Israeli attacks on Yemen.Having been removed by the US from its terrorist designation list in 2021, the Houthis were re-added to it last January.“There is a national, regional and international decision to end the rule of the Houthis in Yemen, whether by peace or by force,” Abdulsalam Mohammed said. “Time will tell how this will materialise.”Abdulsalam Mohammed also believes that this turn away from the Houthis extends to the Gulf.“The Houthi drones and missiles have constantly threatened the oil-producing Gulf states,” Abdulsalam Mohammed said. “Therefore, when the opportunity comes to weaken the Houthis, the Gulf will capitalise on it. Similarly, Houthi opponents in Yemen will prioritise a military solution as the group’s fall becomes possible.”The defeat of the “axis of resistance” in Syria and its losses in Lebanon could also pave the way for the fall of the Houthis in Yemen, according to Abdulsalam Mohammed.“The Houthis have been looking for new allies, such as Russia,” he said. “However, this does not prevent the scenario of Hezbollah’s collapse or the fall of al-Assad’s rule from being repeated in Yemen.”“This is a golden opportunity for the Yemeni government to regain control of provinces it lost to the Houthis over the past years of war.”But that might be easier said than done. There have been few indications that anti-Houthi forces are gearing up for a major offensive.The Houthis control some of the most populated parts of Yemen, but the territory is also largely mountainous and easier to defend than the more flat terrain of the former Syrian opposition’s advance towards Damascus before it fell. The Houthis also still have the support of many of Yemen’s influential tribes, in particular, the tribes that surround Sanaa, which are vital to any chance of taking back control of the capital.Saleh, the history graduate in Sanaa, described the atmosphere in Yemen as calm for now, but added that it could “explode at any moment”.“The Houthis wait for a life-and-death battle, and their opponents remain hesitant to begin a war,” Saleh said. “It may begin at any time, but its end will be indefinite.”","Could the Houthis be next?

Samar is also a victim of domestic violence and has no way to escape her abuser in the cramped conditions of this camp.Two days ago, her husband beat her around the face leaving her with a swollen cheek and a blood spot in her eye. Her eldest daughter clung to her all night following that attack, which happened in front of the children.Samar does not want to break up her family – they have already been forced to move from Gaza City, to the Shati camp in Rafah and now to Khan Younis – and the children are young. Her eldest, Laila, is just 15. She also has 12-year-old Zain, 10-year-old Dana, Lana, seven, and Adi, five, to think about.On the day that Al Jazeera visits her, she is trying to keep her two younger girls occupied with schoolwork. Sitting together in the small tent, which is made from rags, the three have spread out some notebooks around them. Little Dana is huddled up close to her mother, seemingly wanting to give her support. Her younger sister is crying from hunger and Samar seems at a loss as to how to help them both.As a displaced family, the loss of privacy has added a whole new layer of pressure.“I lost my privacy as a woman and a wife in this place. I don’t want to say that my life was perfect before the war, but I was able to express what was inside me in conversation with my husband. I could scream without anyone hearing me,” Samar says. “I could control my children more in my home. Here, I live in the street and the cover of concealment has been removed from my life.”A loud argument between a husband and wife drifts through from the tent next door. Samar’s face turns red with embarrassment and sadness as bad language fills the air. She does not want her children to hear this.Her instinct is to tell the children to go out and play, but Laila is washing dishes in a small bowl of water and the argument next door brings her own problems back into sharp focus.“Every day, I suffer from anxiety because of the disagreements with my husband. Two days ago, it was a great shock for me that he hit me in this way in front of my children. All our neighbours heard my screams and crying and came to calm the situation between us.“I felt broken,” Samar says, worried the neighbours will think she is to blame – that her husband shouts so much because she is a bad wife.“Sometimes, when he screams and curses, I stay quiet so that those around us think he’s screaming at someone else. I try to preserve my dignity a little,” she says.Samar tries to preempt her husband’s anger by attempting to solve the problems facing the family herself. She visits the aid workers every day to ask for food. She believes it is the pressures of the war that have made her husband this way.Before the war, he worked in a small carpentry shop with a friend and this kept him busy. There were fewer arguments.Now, she says: “Because of the severity of the disagreements between me and my husband, I wanted a divorce. But I hesitated for the sake of my children.”Samar goes to psychological support sessions with other women, to try to release some of the negative energy and anxiety building inside her. It helps her to hear that she is not alone. “I hear the stories of many women and I try to console myself with what I am going through, through their experiences.”As she talks, Samar gets up to start preparing food. She is fretting about when her husband will return and whether there will be enough to eat. A plate of beans with cold bread is all she can rustle up right now. She cannot light the fire because there is no gas.Suddenly, Samar goes silent, fearful that a voice outside belongs to her husband. It does not.She asks her daughters to sit down and look at their maths problems. She whispers: “He went out shouting at Adi. I hope he is in a good mood.”Later on, Samar’s husband, Karim Badwan, 42, sits beside his daughters, crammed inside the small tent they are living in.He is despairing. “This is not a life. I can’t comprehend what I’m living. I’m trying to adapt to these difficult circumstances, but I cannot. I’ve turned from a practical and professional man into a man who gets so angry all the time.”Karim says he is deeply ashamed that he has hit his wife on several occasions since the war began.“I hope the war ends before my wife’s energy runs out and she leaves me,” he says. “My wife is a good woman, so she tolerates what I say.”A tear rolls down Samar’s bruised face as she listens.Karim says he knows what he is doing is wrong. Before the war, he never dreamed he would be capable of harming her.“I had friends who used to beat their wives. I used to say: ‘How does he sleep at night?’ Unfortunately, now I do it.“I did it more than once, but the hardest time was when I left a mark on her face and eye. I admit that this is a huge failure in terms of self-control,” Karim says, his voice trembling.“The pressures of war are great. I left my home, my work and my future and I am sitting here in a tent, helpless in front of my children. I can’t find a job and when I leave the tent, I feel that if I talk to anyone I will lose my temper.”Karim knows his wife and children have endured a great deal. “I apologise to them for my behaviour, but I keep doing it. Maybe I need medication, but my wife does not deserve all this from me. I am trying to stop so that she doesn’t have to leave me.”Samar’s despair is compounded by the loss of her own family who she left in the north to flee the bombing there with her husband and his family. Now, she is desperately lonely.Her greatest fear is that she will completely burn out and become unable to care for her family, as she worries her husband already has.The responsibility for finding water and food, caring for the children, and thinking about their future, has all taken its toll and she lives in a constant state of fear.As the eldest child, Laila is developing severe anxiety from the fighting between her father and mother and she fears for her mother.She says: “My father and mother quarrel every day. My mother suffers from a strange nervous state. Sometimes she shouts at me for no reason. I try to bear it and understand her condition so that I don’t lose her. I do not like seeing her in this state, but the war did all of this to us.”Laila still sees Karim as a good father and blames the world for allowing this brutal war to go on for so long. “My father shouts at me a lot. Sometimes he hits my sisters. My mother cries all night and wakes up with swollen eyes from sadness over what we are living.”She sits in her bed for long hours thinking about their lives before the war and her plans to study English.“I try to be strong for my mother.”The family is not alone. In Gaza, there has been a marked rise in domestic violence with many women attending psychological support sessions offered by aid workers in clinics.Kholoud Abu Hajir, a psychologist, has met many victims since the start of the war at clinics in the displacement camps. However, she fears there are far more who are too ashamed to talk about it.“There is a great secrecy and fear among the women about talking about it,” she says. “I have received many cases of violence away from group sessions – women who want to talk about what they are suffering and ask for help.”Living in a constant state of instability and insecurity, enduring repeated displacement and being forced to live in tents crowded very closely together have deprived women of privacy, leaving them with nowhere to turn.“There is no comprehensive psychological treatment system,” Abu Hajir tells Al Jazeera. “We only work in emergency situations. The cases we deal with really require multiple sessions, and some of them are difficult cases where women need protection.“There are very severe cases of violence that have reached sexual assault, and this is a dangerous thing.”The number of divorces has risen – many between spouses who have been separated by the Israeli armed corridor between the north and the south.The war has taken a terrible toll on women and children, particularly, Abu Hajir says.Nevin al-Barbari, 35, a psychologist, says it is impossible to give children in Gaza the support they need in these conditions.“Unfortunately, what children are experiencing during the war cannot be described. They need very long psychological support sessions. Hundreds of thousands of children have lost their homes, lost a family member, and many of them have lost their entire family.”Being forced to live in difficult – and sometimes violent – family circumstances has made life immeasurably worse for many.“There is very clear and widespread family violence among the displaced in particular … Children’s psychological and behavioural states have been affected very negatively. Some children have become very violent and hit other children violently.”Recently, al-Barbari came across the case of a 10-year-old child who had hit another with a stick, causing severe injury and bleeding.“When I met this child, he kept crying,” she says. “He thought that I would punish him. When I asked him about his family, he told me that his mother and father have a big fight every day and his mother goes to her family’s tent for days.“He said he missed his home, his room and the way his family used to be. This child is a very common example of thousands of children.”It will be a long road to recovery for these children, al-Barbari says. “There are no schools to occupy them. Children are forced to bear great responsibilities, filling water and waiting in long lines for food aid. There are no recreational areas for them.“There are so many stories that we do not know about, that these children are living every day.”","‘Broken’: Domestic violence impacts women, children in Gaza","2025-06-28T10:41:04.385917Z"

He was born in the Gaza Strip and grew up in a war zone, his lawyer told the court, while Abushabab sat sobbing as his case was being heard.A further six suspects are set to appear at a later stage. Three of these suspects are minors and their cases will be heard behind closed doors.Police said they were investigating at least 45 people over the violence, including that carried out by fans of the Israeli club.At an emotionally charged news conference the morning after the riots, Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema said the city had been “deeply damaged” by “hateful anti-Semitic rioters”.However, Halsema later said she regretted the parallel she had drawn between the violence and “memories of pogroms”, saying this word had been used as propaganda.","Five convicted over Amsterdam clashes with Israeli football fans","2025-07-15T20:35:25.732999Z"

This is a serious and extremely horrifying situation,” Abu Safia said.Outside the hospital in Beit Lahiya, Israeli forces have placed what is thought to be explosives at the gates. Witnesses said an automated guided vehicle delivered boxes with the word “danger” written on them.Al Jazeera’s Gaza correspondent Tareq Abu Azzoum said the Israeli military has deployed automated remote vehicles called “explosive robots” around the hospital.“[The robots] are loaded with tonnes of explosives that can lead to the destruction of the neighbourhood,” Abu Azzoum said.“We’ve seen videos released by some of the medical workers inside Kamal Adwan Hospital showing how the Israeli military has been using these in the vicinity of the hospital,” he added, saying it could be a sign that further escalation might take place in the coming days.“The Israeli military is systematically trying to exert ultimate pressure on the medical teams by causing severe destruction to the surroundings [of the hospital],” Abu Azzoum said.Abu Safia said: “The world must understand that our hospital is being targeted with the intent to kill and forcibly displace us,” adding that the Israeli bombing did not stop throughout Sunday night, destroying homes and surrounding buildings.“We urge the international community to intervene quickly and stop this fierce assault on us to protect the healthcare system, the workers and the patients within it,” the hospital director said.Since Monday morning, the hospital has been targeted with bombs in its courtyards and on its rooftop dropped by quadcopters, once again threatening the hospital’s fuel and oxygen supplies, he said.“The situation remains extremely dangerous and requires urgent international intervention before it is too late,” the doctor said.Abu Safia made a similar appeal on Sunday, accusing Israel of directly bombing the hospital’s intensive care unit.More than 14 months of Israeli attacks have devastated Gaza and displaced almost all of its 2.3 million people.

The article has been updated to reflect the views they shared. The article now elaborates on Deutsche Welle’s position on the use of the word Palestine, adds details about a planning document obtained by Al Jazeera regarding the anniversary of October 7, and notes that anti-Semitism workshops have been taking place at Deutsche Welle since before October 7. It also includes a statement the spokesperson sent regarding its commitment to anti-Muslim racism as well as anti-Semitism.Names marked with an asterisk* have been changed to protect identities.Berlin, Germany – Senior newsroom figures at Germany’s international broadcaster Deutsche Welle are cultivating a culture of fear among journalists who are tasked with reporting on Israel’s war on Gaza, 13 staff members and freelancers currently working for the network – plus a former long-term correspondent – have told Al Jazeera.They accuse Deutsche Welle of pro-Israel and anti-Palestinian bias, allege that they have heard colleagues make Islamophobic and dehumanising remarks about Palestinians and protesters in the Berlin office with impunity, and have shared with Al Jazeera several internal documents – one of which lists “possible comebacks” for anchors to use during live interviews with “pro-Palestinian voices” who make “controversial statements”, such as accusing Israel of war crimes.Other documents include a separate style guide specifically for covering Israel and the Palestinian territory, which informs staff that the word “for territory, we refer specifically to the West Bank or Gaza, or the Palestinian territories” rather than Palestine as it has not yet gained the status of a state.A handout from an anti-Semitism awareness training event suggests that “hatred of Jews is expressed using codes such as the ‘Zionists’ or the ‘Israelis’ … Therefore, criticism of Israel can also be a form of Israel-related anti-Semitism.”A planning document for the war’s anniversary, at a time when at least 42,000 Palestinians have been killed, including 17,000 children, included the sentence: “The focus should be on the terrorist attack on Israel, but stories dealing with the war in Gaza can also be published on this day.”Stories that spoke of Israeli and Palestinian suffering were planned.The introduction to the document offers a brief summary, stating that the October 7 assault in Israel was “the worst terrorist attack in its history”. On the toll in Gaza, it says: “According to the UN, more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed to date.”“The sense of pressure was constant,” Martin Gak, who has since left the network, told Al Jazeera.“There is a constant sense of fear with (senior staff) looking at the things you were writing with enormous care, almost paranoia.”Gak worked for 10 years at Deutsche Welle as a religious affairs correspondent and senior producer for the political interview show Conflict Zone, which often covers Israel-Palestine.“From a journalistic point of view, Deutsche Welle fills its mouth with grand concepts like freedom of the press, freedom of expression, freedom of conscience. And it’s clear that this is just being used as mouthwash,” said Gak, who is Argentinean and Jewish.All interviewees except Gak requested anonymity, fearing reprisals.While the style guide states that “we do not tolerate the use of racist language towards Palestinians which aim to disparage the Palestinian people”, several sources said staff openly used Islamophobic and anti-Arab slurs in the newsroom.In one instance, a manager referred to pro-Palestine protesters as “looking Allahu Akbar” – a derogatory use of the Arabic phrase meaning “God is great”, alleged Kate*, a current freelancer with the network.In another example, an executive producer questioned whether a Palestinian child could have been faking his suffering for the cameras, Andrew* claimed.“I was doing a report and there’d been a strike,” said Andrew, who is also currently working for Deutsche Welle. A 10-year-old was seen in video footage “crying and saying, ‘The bombs fell and my father and I had to carry my uncle’s body, and half his head was exploded.’”Andrew wanted to have a conversation about the ethics of using traumatic clips of children.“It did create debate in the newsroom that we had in the end. I kept it in, but this particular [executive] produced his argument: ‘How do we know if this kid is acting?’”To most people in the Berlin newsroom, it was clear the child was not acting, Andrew said.“The real question was whether or not we include the suffering of a child.”When asked about these allegations, a Deutsche Welle spokesperson told Al Jazeera via email that the network does not accept “Islamophobic, racist, dehumanising or discriminatory remarks”, adding that it employs an “anti-discrimination officer who is available for everyone”.They did not directly answer Al Jazeera’s question on the alleged comment about child crisis actors, but pointed to a previous example of a fact-checking article.“The team has proven that claims that Palestinian children in Gaza are ‘acting’ are false,” they said.Since October 7, when Hamas launched an incursion into southern Israel during which 1,139 people were killed and more than 200 were taken captive, Israel’s war on Gaza, which is governed by Hamas, has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, the majority of them children and women.“From the senior management I have heard a lot of anti-Muslim and anti-Arab sentiment and a strong bias towards Israel,” said Karen*, who works in the Berlin office.“From a journalistic perspective, it’s ridiculous. I’ve heard someone saying, ‘We always hear that there is no safe place to go in Gaza, but why don’t they [Palestinian civilians] go in the tunnels of Hamas?’ This shows the dehumanisation of Palestinian lives in the eyes of leading figures at Deutsche Welle.”German support for Israel is seen as a historic duty and part of its raison d’etat to atone for the Holocaust.A few days after the Hamas attack, Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare that Germany had “only one place – and it is alongside Israel”. Germany is Israel’s second-largest arms supplier after the United States.Scholz’s government has been accused by lawyers at the International Court of Justice of aiding genocide and, in a separate case, of complicity, claims it denies. It is also regularly accused by activists of cracking down on pro-Palestinian voices.Deutsche Welle, which receives state funds, was founded by the German federal government in 1953.The outlet’s style guide states that Germany’s special responsibility towards Israel “does not mean there cannot be criticism of Israeli policy” and “in all cases, we continue to follow our obligations to report stories impartially.” One email from a manager says, “We want to show the full extent of this war, the human cost on all sides.” Another email says, “Critical coverage of Israeli policy is part of our job as journalists.”But several workers Al Jazeera interviewed fear the channel’s funding model imperils journalistic credibility.“Most of us on the actual newsroom floor see what’s happening and want to do our piece to reveal the realities of what’s happening on the ground [in Gaza],” said Andrew. “There’s a nervousness from the top down which does permeate across the floor and I would say that has guided editorial policy.”Andrew also accused the network of double standards.Regarding the measures on using the word “Palestine”, he said: “I find that inconsistent because we can say Taiwan, we can say Kosovo and the Western Sahara, there’s a list of other things we can say that also fall into that category. There does seem to be some Palestine exceptionalism on that front.”Deutsche Welle refuted claims that it prohibits the word Palestine, explaining that it “uses international standards of journalist wording”.“Palestine is used in the context of Palestine’s activities in international bodies and the actions of the Palestinian Authority: the Palestinian flag, Palestinian prime minister, Palestinian representation. However, we do not refer to the territory itself as Palestine, as it has not yet gained the status of a state,” a spokesperson said.Regarding allegations of pro-Israel bias and newsroom tensions, Deutsche Welle said it promotes “constructive exchange” and repeatedly holds “feedback conferences about our coverage – also about the coverage of the war in Gaza”.“At DW we are committed to impartiality in all of our journalistic work.”Live interviews appear to be a particular concern for management.On October 16 last year, a senior newsroom leader sent an email to guest bookers explaining that because the network does not want “unchallenged” anti-Semitic remarks on air, “we rather pre-record interviews with Palestinian voices right now”.The email read: “If we don’t know a guest’s position and/or fear the voice could be extreme (pro-Hamas, antisemitic, anti-zionist…), we should stick to pre-recordings to check before broadcasting.”If a voice was considered “rather moderate”, as in a guest who “condemns terror” attacks, and an executive producer or anchor believes they can “handle it and challenge problematic remarks, we can go live”, the email concluded.In the document touted as a “quick guide for people preparing for potentially challenging live situations”, Deutsche Welle recommends anchors to respond to guests who accuse Israel of war crimes with something along the lines of, “You are not the only (person) to allege this – but Israel says it’s acting in accordance with international humanitarian law. ‘War crime’ is a legal term – a conclusive answer to this can only be given by the International Court of Justice.”If a guest compares Gaza to a concentration camp or says Israel’s war is akin to a second Holocaust, the document says a presenter could reply: “These terms are incredibly sensitive, especially here in Germany, where they’re seen as trivialising the Holocaust. There are other assessments, too – can you please be more specific in what you are criticising?”On May 22, as more Western countries backed Palestinian statehood, Deutsche Welle cut Palestinian-American legal scholar Noura Erakat short after she referred to the “apartheid” and “genocide” being committed by Israel.The presenter interrupted Erakat once to say that those terms are “highly disputed and of course, rejected by Israel”. The presenter then ultimately ended the exchange abruptly when Erakat called for a boycott against Israel in order to end the “livestreamed genocide”.“We’re just going to have to leave it there,” the presenter said, as Erakat continued speaking, her words inaudible to the audience.Deutsche Welle denied cutting Erekat off.“The presenter added some context to the terms” such as genocide, the spokesperson said. “The interview was terminated when … the time for the interview in a news programme was up.”Newsroom clashes over the years have led to multiple processes, such as compulsory anti-Semitism workshops led by the network’s anti-Semitism expertise team.Amid the trove of internal documents, Deutsche Welle states that there is a distinction between criticism of the Israeli state’s actions and “Israel-related anti-Semitism” and underscores its commitment to impartiality.But Gak, who participated in a workshop, said advice can often seem confusing.He said an instructor of Jewish background spoke for an “entire 15 minutes concerning Jewish noses in the context of Jewish stereotypes that were described and debated”.At one point, the instructor referred to her own nose and asked attendees whether it could be identified as a Jewish nose.Gak said it was the “most incredible moment in 30 years of devoting myself to religion and 45 years of Jewish education and engagement with questions of Judaism”.He added that while he was working on footage of an interview with Palestine’s ambassador to the UK, Husam Zomlot, a member of the anti-Semitism team entered the editing suite to oversee the process.“It was extremely unusual to have someone standing over my shoulder, directly behind us basically saying what was to be cut out,” he said.Zomlot had referred to Palestinians being under oppression for 110 years. The external observer claimed the comment could be construed as anti-Semitic, Gak said.Deutsche Welle told Al Jazeera that it is committed to raising awareness about “anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, anti-Palestinian racism just like awareness about anti-Semitism”.The German broadcaster is the latest major Western media outlet to be accused of pro-Israel bias as tensions flare across newsrooms. Similar concerns have been raised at The New York Times, BBC and CNN.“Reporters who seek to show the suffering of Palestinians or shed light on Israeli warfare, as well as journalists who cover topics about Jewish communities in Germany currently experience a very tense and hostile working climate,” Reporters Without Borders said in a statement sent to Al Jazeera.“They experience hate and incitement online and feel the effects of increasingly narrow corridors of opinion. In recent months, many media professionals, especially with a migrant background, have also contacted the organisation with accusations that a climate of fear and self-censorship prevails in German media outlets.”It said it was investigating these allegations.According to German journalist and media critic Fabian Goldmann, free expression in Germany is marred by “effective smear campaigns” against those who condemn Israel.“If you work for public broadcasters, you are attacked frequently,” he said.Publications like Bild, the right-wing German tabloid, “put you on their cover … there are many instances of German media personnel who have lost their job, following those smear campaigns”, Goldmann said.Kai Hafez, a professor in comparative international media and communication research at the University of Erfurt, said the decontextualisation of the Israel-Palestine conflict is commonplace in the Western media but especially stark in Germany.“We have a tendency to view Israelis as victims only, rather than, you know, clarifying that they are also an occupying territory. That they are exerting what I would call state terrorism in a lot of respects,” he told Al Jazeera.Islamophobia and “Arabphobia” in Western media “all blends to some type of dehumanisation,” he said. “Obviously, Arab victims are not as important as other types of victims here.”Jad Salfiti previously freelanced at Deutsche Welle from 2016 until 2018, but none of the investigative work for this piece was carried out during that time.","As Gaza war rages, Deutsche Welle insiders accuse outlet of pro-Israel bias","2025-07-14T21:45:23.500787Z"

Following the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Israel has also furthered its expansion into Syria, with plans to increase settlements there.Israel has also emerged from a 14-month war with Hezbollah with seemingly the upper hand after a ceasefire agreement required Hezbollah to withdraw its fighters from Lebanon’s south.Hezbollah has long been considered the spearhead in a network of allies, known as the “axis of resistance”, that Iran helped build in the Middle East.But the Lebanese group emerged badly wounded from the conflict, which culminated in 62 days of all-out war.While Hezbollah managed to inflict damages on invading Israeli troops in southern Lebanon, Israel assassinated the group’s top military and political leaders, including its chief Hassan Nasrallah.Moreover, Israeli officials have said that they wiped out a large part of Hezbollah’s rocket arsenal.The ceasefire that came into effect on November 27 was supposed to end the hostilities, but the Israeli military has been conducting near-daily strikes in Lebanon, signalling that it intends to use force to prevent Hezbollah from rebuilding its military power.Hezbollah, meanwhile, has claimed victory, arguing that it thwarted Israel’s project to completely eliminate it from Lebanon.Nonetheless, analysts say a beleaguered Hezbollah means a weakened Tehran. The group may no longer be in a position to act as an effective force against Israel should a regional war involving Iran erupt.Tehran’s regional influence was dealt another blow with the fall of President al-Assad, another ally. His government was toppled earlier this month after opposition fighters captured Damascus.Still, Iranian leaders have projected defiance, rejecting claims that the “axis of resistance” has been defeated.“With the developments in Syria and the crimes the Zionist regime is committing and the crimes that America is committing, and the help that some others are giving to them, they thought that the resistance was over,” Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said in a speech on Tuesday.“They are completely wrong.”On Wednesday, Iranian media outlets cited a top military official as saying that Iran will respond militarily to the Israeli attack in October.Iran fired nearly 200 missiles at Israeli military bases on October 1 in retaliation for the killing of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and the assassination of Nasrallah in Beirut earlier this year.But Israel’s increasing reach in the Middle East has sparked concerns that Iran may build a nuclear bomb to restore deterrence and protect itself from potential Israeli attacks.Iranian leaders, however, have said repeatedly that the country is not seeking nuclear weapons.Blinken said on Wednesday that an Iranian effort to get a nuclear bomb is “not inevitable”.“This is something that may be more a question now because they’ve lost different tools. They’ve lost different lines of defence,” he said.“Sure, you’re going to see more thinking about that, but the costs and consequences for them for pursuing that route, I think, would be severe.”Blinken praised the 2015 nuclear deal that saw Iran curb its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting international sanctions against its economy.Former President Donald Trump, who was re-elected to a second term in November, ultimately nixed the accord, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in 2018.As the US reapplied sanctions on the Iranian economy and imposed more penalties, Iran began enriching uranium at higher levels, shortening the time to needed acquire the material for a nuclear weapon from months to weeks.The outgoing administration of President Joe Biden engaged in indirect talks with Iran, but negotiations ultimately failed to revive the agreement.With Trump coming into office next month, the US is expected to ramp up economic pressure on Iran even further.Although the president-elect portrays himself as an antiwar politician, he has appointed several foreign policy hawks to key positions in his administration.On Wednesday, Blinken said diplomacy with Iran is still possible.“There is the prospect of negotiations. Of course, it depends on what Iran chooses to do and whether it chooses to engage,” he said.“And of course, the incoming administration will have to make a decision. President Trump last time around in pulling out of the deal, he said that he wanted so-called a ‘better, stronger deal’. So let’s see. I think that would be a better way to approach it.”Blinken added that, no matter what US party is in power, Washington will always be committed to ensuring that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.Israel, the top US ally in the region, is widely believed to have an undeclared nuclear arsenal. Washington has provided billions of dollars in military aid to Israel, which has been accused by United Nations experts and leading human rights groups of committing genocide in Gaza.Still, the US portrays itself as a defender of freedom and human rights in the Middle East.While dealing with external threats, the Iranian government has had to contend with domestic antigovernment protests in recent years, which it met with a harsh security crackdown, according to rights groups.When asked about the possibility of the US supporting Iranian opposition forces to oust the government in Tehran, Blinken urged caution.“I think if we look at the last 20 years, our experiments in regime change have not exactly been resounding successes,” he said. “So, I think we have to have an appropriate degree of humility in focusing in that way on a problem.”","Blinken says Iran had bad year, but nuclear negotiations possible","2025-07-14T21:34:29.211800Z"

Yet the EU continues to partner with Israeli institutions under its “Horizon” scheme, a programme that funds research and innovation.Data collected by the European Commission and analysed by Al Jazeera shows that since October 7, the EU has awarded Israeli institutions more than 238 million euros ($250m), including 640,000 euros ($674,000) to Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), a top aerospace and aviation manufacturer supplying the Israeli army.While guidelines regulating the Horizon framework require funded projects to be “exclusively focused on civil applications”, they acknowledge that a “considerable number of technologies and products are generic and can address the needs of both civil and military users”.Technology that can serve both civil and military uses – so-called “dual use” – may qualify for EU funding as long as the stated objective is civil.But in July, when about 40,000 people had been killed in Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, more than 2,000 European academics and 45 organisations petitioned the EU to end all funding to Israeli institutions, saying the Horizon framework had played “a critical role in the advancement of Israeli military technology” by transferring knowledge to the defence industry.“These funding schemes directly support projects developing Israeli military and weapons capabilities,” the petition said. “Given the scale, duration and nature of human rights violations by the Israeli government, Israeli institutions’ participation in European research and education programs must be suspended.”That call went unanswered.The EU’s support for Israel has been a fixture of its foreign policy since long before the Hamas attack, during which 1,139 people were killed and more than 200 Israelis were taken captive.The bloc has channelled vast sums of public money since 1996 to Israel through research and innovation programmes. Israel is not an EU member, but participates as an associated country in funding initiatives.Under the Horizon 2020 framework programme that ran between 2014 and 2020, Israeli organisations received a total EU contribution of 1.28bn euros ($1.35bn). Since Horizon Europe was launched in 2021, it has so far been granted over 747 million euros ($786m).IAI, which exports weapons systems worldwide, received 2.7 million euros ($2.8m) under Horizon Europe and over 10.7 million euros ($11.2m) under Horizon 2020, European Commission data shows.Elbit Systems, the Israel-based military company whose biggest single customer is the Israeli Ministry of Defence, was awarded grants for five projects under Horizon 2020 for a total 2.2 million euros ($2.3m).All funded projects have a stated “civilian” theme – such as border protection, disaster control and maritime surveillance – and are subject to ethics assessments to review their compliance with EU values.But there is no EU mechanism that forbids the use of cutting-edge technology acquired with the funds for military applications in parallel or at a later stage.IAI was granted 1.4 million euros ($1.47m) under the ResponDrone project launched in 2019 to develop 3D mapping for drone technology to “provide accurate location information to first responders”.Under a scheme named COPAC, launched in 2017, Elbit Systems and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem received over one million euros ($1.05m) for work on engineered quantum dots, technology that centres around ultrafast computers performing tasks such as breaking, disrupting or eavesdropping on present-day security systems.Al Jazeera filed a freedom of information request seeking the results of ethics assessments of projects involving Israel. The European Commission denied the request, saying their disclosure would “seriously undermine the Commission’s functioning and internal decision-making process”.In March, the Commission responded to The Left group in the European Parliament, which asked why the grants were signed off for IAI amid the war in Gaza.The bloc maintained that it “does not fund actions for the development of products and technologies prohibited by applicable international law”.The office of Iliana Ivanova, the European Commissioner for Innovation responsible for the implementation of the Horizon programme, did not respond to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment.Al Jazeera approached a dozen researchers who worked with Israeli institutions under Horizon. Most declined to be interviewed but underscored the civil intent of their projects.Fabrizio Calderoni, professor at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, Italy, participated in the ROXANNE project that concluded in 2022. It aimed to develop “new speech technologies, face recognition and network analysis to facilitate the identification of criminals”.Israel’s Ministry of Public Security – which oversees bodies including the police and prison service – was among the participants with a grant of nearly 135,000 euros ($142,145).Calderoni said research involving law enforcement – as opposed to the military – is considered “civil” in nature under EU parameters.He added that the project focused “on a network of anonymous people who had committed burglaries, with the aim of finding patterns to identify the perpetrators of these crimes”.Asked if the results could have been used to inform Israel’s military action in Gaza or the occupied West Bank, he told Al Jazeera, “We do not have any proof that these tools have been used for a purpose other than that stated in the project.”While it may be impossible to establish how the expertise gained through EU-funded projects is used by Israeli partners, critics argue that the possibility of it enabling systematic human rights violations should be sufficient to call off collaboration.Fabrizio Sebastiani, director of research at the National Council for Research in Italy (CNR), has been using machine learning – a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) – to establish the authorship of unattributed medieval texts.“While this topic might seem innocuous, I was horrified to learn that the very same machine learning techniques are also at the basis of the recently documented Lavender system” employed by the Israeli military for use in Gaza, he told Al Jazeera.Several media outlets have reported on Israel’s use of “Lavender”, an AI-driven system that generates kill lists by analysing surveillance data.Similarly employed in Gaza is a tool reportedly called “Where’s Daddy?”, which tracks and links individuals to specific locations and sends an alert when they return, and “The Gospel”, which Israel’s army boasts can “produce targets at a fast pace”.United Nations human rights experts say Israel’s use of AI in Gaza has taken an “unprecedented toll” on civilians. Human Rights Watch has warned that the tools risk violating international humanitarian law.“These are technologies that need to maximise an objective, and the objective can be changed,” Sebastiani said. An algorithm devised to analyse the recurring use of punctuation and terminology in an unattributed text, for instance, can be tweaked to pick up cues deemed indicators of a potential threat and flag it as a military target, he explained.Sebastiani was recently approached by an Israeli institution to collaborate on a project outside of Horizon. He refused.Al Jazeera has found that Horizon Europe is funding Israeli institutions to take part in AI-based research similar to Sebastiani’s work.In January, Reichman University, in Israel’s coastal city of Herzliya, was awarded nearly 3 million euros ($3.16m) as part of a project studying Sanskrit and Tibetan Buddhist texts to develop “cutting-edge computational tools to revolutionise the study of this material”.Israeli institutions also partnered in schemes to develop “surveillance and security tools” for “counterterrorism”.Under Horizon 2020, Bar-Ilan University and the Israeli Ministry of Public Security received 1.3 million euros ($1.37m) and 267,000 euros ($281,000) respectively to develop an interrogation training simulator.Since January, Israel’s International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) and its home institution, Reichman University, have participated in the EU-GLOCTER project to promote “scientific excellence and technological innovation in counter-terrorism”. The project’s description offers few details, but its website features an image of soldiers in camouflage raiding a dishevelled brick house.Dublin City University, which coordinates the project, told Al Jazeera the funds initially allocated to the Israeli partners were suspended earlier this year. It did not elaborate on the reasons behind the decision, but the move followed a student-led campaign in Ireland against Israel’s involvement in the project.The European Commission’s database still lists Reichman and ICT as partners in EU-GLOCTER.The largest share of EU Horizon funds awarded to Israeli entities is allocated to academic institutions.While universities are often seen as bastions of civil freedoms, Israeli scholar Maya Wind said the Israeli academia was the backbone of the country’s military industry.“Israeli universities are pillars of Israeli racial rule, they are central to the infrastructure of Israeli settler colonialism and of apartheid and now they are also actively servicing this genocide and making it possible to sustain [the war in Gaza] for over 13 months,” Wind said.In her book, Towers of Ivory and Steel: How Israeli Universities Deny Palestinian Freedom, she describes how Hebrew University was the first to be established by the Zionist movement in 1918, followed by the Technion Israel Institute of Technology in 1925 and the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1934.These institutions became central in the development and manufacture of weapons used to forcibly displace Palestinians in the lead-up to the formation of the State of Israel in 1948.The Weizmann Institute and the Technion later led the development of Israel’s military industries.In 1954, Technion founded an aeronautical engineering department and its students spearheaded the development IAI, the aerospace company. The state-owned defence technology company Rafael was also birthed in their premises.“Collaboration of any kind with an Israeli university is coming at the direct expense of Palestinian liberation,” said Wind.","EU research funds flow to Israel despite outrage over Gaza war","2025-07-14T21:35:56.275737Z"

This is how Ireland allowed itself to behave towards Israel.”Responding to the furore, Harris told reporters in Dublin that Ireland would not be silenced, stressing Ireland had remained consistent throughout the war in its support for Israel’s “right to defend itself” within the limits of international law.However, “You know what I think is reprehensible?,” Harris caveated, “Killing children, I think that’s reprehensible. You know what I think is reprehensible? Seeing the scale of civilian deaths that we’ve seen in Gaza. You know what I think is reprehensible? People being left to starve and humanitarian aid not flowing.”Irish politicians have largely provided vocal criticism of Israel’s war on Gaza, but this is a reflection of the wider sentiment in Ireland, where much of the public sees Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians as a mirror of the centuries-long English occupation of Ireland. Even if their actions sometimes fall short, Ireland and Irish politicians have provided vocal criticism of Israel throughout its war on Gaza, reflecting a feeling polls show to be widespread across a society that finds much in Palestinian history to mirror its own.“People say they understand it right away,” said Fatin Al Tamimi, the Vice Chair of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign (IPSC).Al Tamimi’s own sister is currently trapped in Gaza, and even with Harris’s criticisms of Israel she still wants his government to do more and end trade with Israel. But among the Irish public, Al Tamimi said she has always felt a kindred spirit.“As soon as they find out I’m Palestinian, they immediately say they get it, but I still have to explain what the occupation and apartheid means and the scale of the genocide being carried out in Gaza,” Al Tamimi said.In November 2023, just a month after the Hamas-led attack on Israel and the start of Israel’s war on Gaza, former Irish leader Leo Varadkar characterised Israel’s actions as “approaching revenge”. A month later, Ireland, with the backing of Spain, Belgium, and Malta, urged other countries within the bloc to call for a ceasefire, admitting there was “some truth” in accusations from the Global South that the European Union was employing double standards in its position on the wars in Ukraine – where it was clear in its condemnation of Russia’s invasion and occupation – and Gaza.However, it wasn’t until May of this year that Ireland, along with Spain and Norway recognised Palestinian statehood, eliciting the fury of the Israeli government, which temporarily recalled its ambassador, Dana Erlich.“Irish support for Palestine is longstanding and widespread,” Ray Murphy, professor at the Irish Centre for Human Rights, University of Galway told Al Jazeera, “It cuts across all social classes, ages and political allegiances.”“I think politicians, even those known for traditionally supporting Palestine, were surprised by the strength of feeling on the doorstep,” Murphy said, referring to Ireland’s November general election, and the practice of politicians knocking on household doors to elicit support.“Palestine is an issue people here care deeply about. It’s one of the few issues where there are no grey areas; people see it as just right.”Coverage of Ireland’s decision to join the South African case has been limited, if barbed, within the Israeli media, left-wing Israeli legislator Ofer Cassif told Al Jazeera.On Tuesday, the widely read Times of Israel ran a blog piece entitled, Why the Irish Hate the Jews, in which the author Lisa Liel stated that it was Ireland’s ingrained Christianity, a religion she characterised as “inherently anti semitic” that had led to it objecting to Israel’s killing of more than 45,000 Palestinians in Gaza.The same day, Israeli author Saul Sadka took to social media to wryly compare and conflate years of Irish migration as a result of famine, poverty and colonisation to criticism of Israel for colonising Palestinian land.The row with Ireland “definitely doesn’t undermine the government or the support to Netanyahu”, Cassif said, “And even the media hardly covers it. You know, it is the usual, the ordinary drill: every time that there is a criticism from one angle or another it is immediately [branded] anti-Semitism and all that hogwash,” he said.However, while the current row with Israel may win Dublin some domestic support, it nevertheless casts Ireland, and to a lesser degree Spain, as outliers within an EU that typically backs Israel.Germany has been a strong backer of Israel, clamping down on pro-Palestinian activism in the country. Meanwhile, the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has repeatedly backed Israel, leading to a letter of complaint from hundreds of EU officials.“I understand that some EU countries, such as Germany, have their own reasons for supporting Israel, but I’m not so worried about the EU,” Murphy said.“The EU is bound by treaties and conventions and protocols, so that’s not much of a concern,” Murphy added. “What is concerning is the US, which is Ireland’s largest overseas investor and what this might mean for the future of that relationship, especially with the incoming Trump administration.”While the degree of direct support offered by the US to Israel by a Trump administration is unlikely to vary greatly from his predecessor, the incoming president’s previous use of trade and tariffs as a means to secure international political advantage is concerning, Murphy said.Despite its relatively small population, Ireland attracts a considerable level of direct foreign investment from the United States, ranking sixth, above Italy, South Korea and Mexico; countries with populations far in excess of Ireland’s 5 million.Will that be enough to change Ireland’s official positions if the US increases its pressure? That will depend on how far the next US administration is willing to go for Israel, and how resolute Ireland and its politicians prove to be.But many Irish are unwavering. And in Al Tamimi’s case, the connection is personal, and one that speaks to both sides of her identity, and that of her three Irish-born and bred children.“They want to see Palestine,” she explained.” Of course, they’re Irish citizens. They could go there to visit, but that’s not the same. They’re Palestinian. They want to go there and live.”","Irish support for Palestinians stands firm, despite Israeli anger","2025-07-14T21:33:58.510975Z"

They can’t get any treatment because none of the hospitals in Beit Hanoon are operational,” he said, noting that the storming of the school happened “without prior warning”.The Palestinian news agency WAFA also confirmed the 15 deaths.WAFA reported that those who remained at the besieged school, many of them women and children, were being forced to leave the area and move towards a military checkpoint set up at Salah al-Din Street. Several of the men were reportedly detained.The siege of the school is still under way.In all, at least 46 Palestinians were killed across Gaza in the last 24 hours, the besieged territory’s Ministry of Health said, adding that five “massacres” were committed by Israeli forces during the same period.Of total death toll, at least 14 were reported in the southern Gaza City, including in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, where an Israeli raid hit a residential building in the Abu Iskandar area.Our colleagues from Al Jazeera Arabic also reported that four of those deaths were from an Israeli raid on a house in al-Nafaq Street in the centre of Gaza City.Three other people were killed in a separate strike on a house in Zeitoun neighbourhood south of Gaza City.The Palestinian news agency WAFA confirmed that an Israeli air raid hit a tent sheltering displaced people in Beit Hanoon, killing several civilians and wounding many others.Two others were reported killed following a separate Israeli attack on the area surrounding Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, WAFA added.Four Palestinians were also killed in Shujayea, Khan Younis.At least 135 other people were reported injured in the Israeli attacks on Sunday.The deadly Israeli raids and bombings come just a day after Israeli forces killed several people after hitting a school in Gaza City, and just two days after a massacre in Nuseirat refugee camp.Meanwhile, Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud confirmed on Sunday that Palestinian journalist Mohammed Jabr al-Qrinawi was killed along with his wife and children in an Israeli air attack that targeted their home in Bureij refugee camp, in central Gaza, late on Saturday.The Egypt-based Al-Ahram reported that al-Qrinawi was affiliated with Sanad News Agency, a distinct entity from Al Jazeera’s Sanad Verification Unit. Al-Qrinawi was the second journalist killed on Saturday.Earlier on Saturday, Al Mashhad Media said its journalist Mohammed Balousha was killed in an Israeli attack in Gaza.George Eid, director of news at Al Mashhad, confirmed Balousha’s killing, saying it was a targeted attack.Balousha was the Palestinian journalist who broke the story on the decomposing bodies of premature babies in the ICU, who were left to die by Israeli forces at al-Nasr Hospital last year.The separate killings of al-Qrinawi and Balousha raise the death toll of Palestinian journalists to 196. The Committee to Protect Journalists has compiled records of at least 137 Palestinian journalists killed.On Tuesday, two separate reports from media freedom organisations said Israel carried out a “massacre” of journalists in Gaza.The Israeli government denied the accusations.According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, at least 44,976 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces since October 7, 2023.","Israeli forces storm Gaza school sheltering displaced, killing at least 15","2025-07-14T22:06:13.806869Z"

Pace yourselves and buckle up,” he wrote in a social media post.To assume leadership of the committee, the Florida Republican still needs to be elected by the full House, where his party holds a thin majority when the new chamber takes office early in January.If successful, Mast — who wore an Israeli army uniform to the US Capitol last year — will preside over the panel that oversees legislation related to foreign policy.Mast, a US army veteran who lost his legs in an attack in Afghanistan, has previously served as a civilian volunteer in the Israeli military.Since the start of Israel’s war in Gaza in October last year, Mast has publicly defended Israel’s right to use any means necessary to attack the Palestinian enclave.Last year, for example, Mast said humanitarian aid to Gaza “should be slowed down”, despite a suffocating Israeli siege that has caused deadly starvation in the enclave.The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant in November for suspected war crimes, including the use of hunger as a weapon of war.Mast has also suggested that all Palestinians in Gaza are legitimate targets for Israeli violence and starvation.“I don’t think we would so lightly throw around the term ‘innocent Nazi civilians’ during World War II. It is not a far stretch to say there are very few innocent Palestinian civilians,” the US congressman said last year.The remarks prompted Democratic Congresswoman Sara Jacobs to lead an unsuccessful push to formally rebuke Mast in the House.“Brian Mast’s comments are incredibly dangerous and dehumanizing as we continue to push for humanitarian aid to reach Palestinians in harm’s way in Gaza and as Islamophobic hate crimes rise,” Jacobs said in a statement at that time.Medea Benjamin, co-founder of the antiwar group Code Pink, described Mast as the “most cruel, heartless member of Congress”.“His total disregard for Palestinian civilians fans the flames of violence. His position as chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee bodes ill for a foreign policy that strives to protect human life and promote peace,” she told Al Jazeera.Benjamin and other activists confronted Mast on Capitol Hill about his views earlier this year. When asked whether he has seen pictures of Palestinian children killed by Israel, the Republican legislator responded: “These are not innocent Palestinian civilians.”Israel has killed at least 44,800 Palestinians, including more than 17,000 children, in Gaza since the start of the war, according to local health authorities.United Nations experts and rights groups have described the Israeli campaign as a genocide: an effort to destroy the Palestinian people in whole or in part.Mast rejects any criticism against Israel by international groups and the UN. He has also called for disbanding the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.Yasmine Taeb, the legislative and political director at MPower Change, a Muslim American civic engagement group, highlighted Mast’s history of “inflammatory and dehumanizing remarks”.“Mast’s election as the next Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee just shows the utter absurdity and fanaticism we should expect from the House GOP next year,” Taeb told Al Jazeera in a statement.When asked for comment about the criticism, Mast’s office referred Al Jazeera to the congressman’s response to CAIR on social media.Critics fear Mast’s nomination is likely part of a larger trend towards unquestioning support for Israel’s war.While Democratic President Joe Biden has already provided billions of dollars in unconditional support to Israel, the incoming administration of Republican President Donald Trump is set to be dominated by even more staunchly pro-Israel officials.So Mast may be able to push foreign policy measures in coordination with allies at the White House. Republicans will also have a majority in the Senate.Hassan el-Tayyab, legislative director for Middle East policy at the Friends Committee on National Legislation, a Quaker social justice group, called Mast one of the “most ferociously anti-Palestinian voices” in Congress.“His position unfortunately reflects a broader sentiment among too many Congress members who continue to supply unconditional weapons and military support to Israel, despite the Netanyahu government violating countless US laws and policies through its indiscriminate military campaign in Gaza and beyond,” el-Tayyab told Al Jazeera.Netanyahu’s office welcomed Mast’s nomination earlier this week, hailing the congressman as a “great American patriot and a true friend of Israel”.","Brian Mast: Pro-Israel hawk set to lead US House foreign policy panel","2025-07-15T20:35:32.271190Z"

The consulate was subsequently “invaded and damaged” after the mission had to be evacuated.Iran stopped short of officially blaming the HTS or any other specific group for the actions.After footage appeared online showing the embassy trashed and large images of assassinated leaders Qassem Soleimani and Hassan Nasrallah taken down, Iran’s Araghchi said it appeared some civilians were also involved.It is unclear if, or when, the Iranian diplomatic missions will be reopened.","What is Iran signalling since the fall of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad?","2025-06-28T10:47:04.316641Z"

blistering military offensive that aims to overthrow the government.The foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Turkiye held Astana-format talks, joined by United Nations representatives in Qatar on Saturday, as more Syrian cities fell to the armed opposition groups.Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters after the meeting in Doha that participants agreed that the conflict should end and that political dialogue needs to be established between the Syrian government and “legitimate opposition groups”.He met with his Syrian and Iraqi counterparts in Baghdad a day earlier, their statement saying “continuous coordination, cooperation and diplomatic engagement” is the only way to avoid further escalation.At a joint news conference after the meeting, Iran’s top diplomat said his country would stand with Syria against groups that “are without a doubt carrying out an American-Zionist conspiracy”.Tehran has emphasised the idea that the rebels are foreign-supported in an apparent effort to prevent this offensive from being seen as a mere continuation of the civil war in Syria – which had solidified al-Assad’s position after 13 years of fighting that destroyed much of the country.Iran has also issued stern warnings that fighting in Syria could spread across the region, considering the high level of tension amid Israel’s brutal war on Gaza.The opposition offensive started last week, just after Israel and Hezbollah agreed to a shaky ceasefire deal that has held so far despite numerous violations.It was launched from Idlib by the group controlling the governorate, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), along with allied armed factions.HTS’s chequered past saw it start as al-Qaeda offshoot Jabhat al-Nusra until its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Julani, embraced a more nationalistic – rather than transnational – mission and rebranded as HTS in 2017, ostensibly a more “moderate” group amid the factions competing for Syria.Al-Julani has been at the forefront of a media campaign emphasising HTS’s reformed ways, being filmed in public in Aleppo multiple times, including this week after an Iranian lawmaker proudly proclaimed in parliament that he had been killed in a Russian air strike.He also released videos of himself directly addressing the people and leaders of Syria and the region and gave an interview to CNN on Friday and allowed it to report from Aleppo hours after the city was taken.Asked why people should believe his reforms while HTS remains designated a “terrorist” organisation by the UN, the US and the EU – and there is a $10m reward on his head – he said: “These classifications are primarily political and wrong.”He promised he would build an “institutions-based” Syria that would recognise the country’s ethnic, cultural and sectarian diversities.The Iranian foreign ministry has been hesitant to publicly rebuke Ankara for its backing of HTS, but Araghchi met with his counterpart in Turkiye on Monday for a reportedly tense conversation prior to the talks on Saturday.Ali Akbar Velayati, a longtime foreign policy advisor to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appeared to express disbelief about Turkish support for the Syria offensive earlier this week.“We did not think that Turkiye would fall in the hole dug” by the US and Israel, he said, suggesting that the shifting reality in Syria is Israeli and Western-backed and would harm the whole of the Muslim world.However, Iranian state television late on Friday started referring to the rebels as “armed groups” in an apparent policy shift from calling them “terrorists”.During an address on Friday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan backed the rebel offensive and said he had contacted al-Assad to hold talks and find a solution but did not receive a positive response.“Idlib, Hama, Homs, and of course, the ultimate target is Damascus,” Erdogan said. “Our hope is that this march in Syria proceeds without any accidents or troubles.”Erdogan has been seeking to eliminate an armed Kurdish presence or territory on Turkiye’s borders, as the country tries to resolve a longrunning struggle against armed Kurdish separatists, the outlawed PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party).It also wants to establish a “safe zone” in northern Syria to resettle millions of Syrian refugees currently in Turkiye.Near Iran’s borders to the north, Turkiye is supporting the Zangezur Corridor, a proposed transport route linking Azerbaijan to its exclave Nakhchivan through Armenia’s Syunik Province, which would effectively connect Turkiye, Azerbaijan and Central Asia.If realised, the corridor would sever a significant Iranian route to Europe and bypass Armenian control.Within this context, a major difference between the continuing offensive in Syria and the conflict that started in 2011 is the level of overt support provided to anti-Assad forces by Turkiye, Tehran-based political analyst Ehsan Movahedian said.“While much of the fighting during the time of the civil war was driven by ideology, the nature of the fighting this time predominantly revolves around geopolitical goals,” Movahedian told Al Jazeera.“Turkiye is pursuing an array of geopolitical goals, including dealing a blow to the interests of Iran and the axis of resistance across the region, and reaping potential economic gains by expanding its presence in northern Syria.”Movahedian said Ankara may inadvertently push Arab nations’ stance on Syria closer to Iran since HTS has displayed “radical” thinking over the years that does not enjoy broad backing in the Arab and Islamic world.Iran’s Araghchi has threatened that Tehran could directly send soldiers into Syria, without saying what conditions would prompt Tehran to make that move.The Iranian foreign ministry on Saturday denied reports that Tehran’s embassy in Damascus has been evacuated.But Tehran has not officially commented on media reports that Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) personnel and some other Iran-aligned fighters have evacuated Syria.Especially in this environment, sending in a large number of soldiers would be a significant shift for Iran, which has so far relied on proxy fighters and sending in senior commanders as “military advisers” rather than keeping Iranian boots on the ground. At least one Iranian general has been killed in Syria since the flareup of fighting last week.Two generals and other senior IRGC personnel have been killed in Israeli air strikes since the start of the war on Gaza. Another top IRGC commander was killed in Lebanon in late September as he was in the same bunker with assassinated Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.“Syria is on the brink of collapse and we are watching coolly,” Tehran lawmaker Ahmad Naderi wrote in a post on X, echoing a sentiment that has been reflected by state television commentators as well.“If Damascus falls, we will also lose Lebanon and Iraq and must fight the enemy on our borders. We have given much blood to preserve Syria.”The MP added he does not understand why Iran is not more eager to intervene, but “whatever the reason is, it’s not to the benefit of the country and something must be done before it is too late”.Other members of the Iran-led axis of resistance – Hezbollah in Lebanon and armed factions in Iraq – have expressed their backing for al-Assad’s government.But despite videos circulating online that have purportedly shown tens of thousands of soldiers and heavy arms ready to deploy to Syria from Iraq – and some even entering Syria – there has been no official deployment.HTS in a statement late Friday asserted that it would not invade Lebanon and Al-Julani released a video asking Iraqi forces not to enter Syria, prompting a pro-Iran Kataeb Hezbollah leader to accuse him of using “Zionist-stricken mercenaries”.Iran and Russia would need to send in major military assistance if they want to revitalise al-Assad, according to Aron Lund, a fellow at Century International and a Middle East analyst at the Swedish Defence Research Agency, who said he is “very sceptical” this would happen under current circumstances.He added that sending Iranian troops to Syria would also be risky due to Israeli attacks on Iranian positions there, and Russia may not be prepared to back them with significant air power due to the war in Ukraine.“Whether Assad keeps his regime afloat or not, Syria is unlikely to have a well-functioning central government for a while.“Parts of Syria may just degenerate into warring fiefdoms, with extremism, guns, and refugees pouring out across the borders. There’s a real risk of that, especially along the Jordanian and Iraqi borders.”","Where does Iran stand on Syria’s fast-moving conflict?","2025-06-24T20:18:03.889236Z"

RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!” he wrote.The post offered no details on what the threat would entail or if it could involve the deployment of the US military. It also did not specify which parties it was referring to but notably referenced only captives held by Hamas without mentioning Palestinian civilians who have borne the brunt of Israeli operations in Gaza.Both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the leaders of Hamas have been accused of scuttling talks aimed at ending the fighting for months.Hamas has repeatedly offered to release captives held in Gaza in return for an end to the war, but the Israeli government is adamant that the war will continue until Hamas is totally defeated.At least one Israeli official was quick to praise Trump’s post on Monday.“Thank you and bless you Mr. President-elect @realDonaldTrump,” President Isaac Herzog wrote on X. “We all pray for the moment we see our sisters and brothers back home!”Despite its ambiguity, the promise of escalation represents a departure for Trump as the Middle East policy of his second term continues to take shape.The former president had campaigned on the broad notion that he would bring about peace in the Middle East, particularly in Gaza, but has offered scant details on how that would be achieved. His “America First” platform has long eschewed further involvement of US forces, assets or funding in conflicts abroad.At the same time, Trump has voiced support for Israel to “finish the job” in the Palestinian enclave and has long been Netanyahu’s preferred leader in the US.During his first term from 2017 to 2021, Trump was a strong backer of the US ally.He moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the illegally occupied eastern half of which has long been seen as the capital of a future Palestinian state. He recognised Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights in Syria. He forged a series of normalisation agreements between Israel and Arab countries, and he allowed for the rapid expansion of Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law.This time around, Trump has packed his administration nominations with staunchly pro-Israel officials, including his secretary of state pick Senator Marco Rubio, a rabid defender of Israel’s war, and ambassador to Israel pick Mike Huckabee, a vocal supporter of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank who refuses to use its commonly used name, instead referring to “Judea and Samaria”.Still, speaking to the Axios news site last week, Trump ally and Senator Lindsey Graham said the president-elect “is more determined than ever to release the hostages and supports a ceasefire that includes a hostage deal”.“He wants to see it happening now,” he said.Graham made the statement just days after Biden announced a ceasefire had been reached between Israel and Hezbollah to end the fighting in Lebanon.As of Monday, that agreement appeared to be on the brink of collapse with both Hezbollah and Israel accusing the other of violating its terms.Biden also promised to re-up efforts to reach a long elusive deal to end the fighting in Gaza, where at least 44,466 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its war following the October 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas that killed at least 1,139 people in Israel with more than 200 taken captive.Israeli authorities have said 101 captives remain in Gaza. On Monday, Hamas said a total of 33 captives had been killed since the beginning of the war.On Sunday, Hamas officials told reporters the group’s leaders had held talks with Egyptian security officials in a renewed push for a ceasefire. Israeli officials also said Netanyahu was to hold security talks on the matter.Speaking to CNN, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said he thought the chances of a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal had improved despite remaining a distant prospect.“[Hamas] are isolated. Hezbollah is no longer fighting with them, and their backers in Iran and elsewhere are preoccupied with other conflicts,” he said.“So I think we may have a chance to make progress, but I’m not going to predict exactly when it will happen. … We’ve come so close so many times and not gotten across the finish line.”White House officials have repeatedly made similar assertions without successfully bringing about a ceasefire.","Trump says ‘hell to pay’ if captives in Gaza not released","2025-07-15T20:43:59.665166Z"

Most of them were air strikes. However, some were rescue attempts by the Israeli military gone wrong.According to the Hamas, the first incident was an Israeli air strike that killed four captives on October 9, 2023. The latest was the killing of a captive during the Israeli military operation in northern Gaza last month.“By continuing your mad war, you may lose your captives forever. Do what needs to be done before it’s too late,” the video concluded.Separately on Monday, the White House issued a statement grieving the death of Omer Neutra, a US citizen who was serving in the Israeli military.Neutra was killed by Hamas during its attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, while serving as a tank commander for the army, according to the White House.Incoming US President Donald Trump issued his own statement on the captives later on Monday, warning in a social media post that where would be “ALL HELL TO PAY” if they are not released by January 20, the day he takes office.Meanwhile, delegations from the Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas met in Cairo to “reach a mutual understanding” on the Palestinian Authority’s management of the Gaza Strip after the end of Israel’s war, Egypt’s foreign minister said on Monday.“There are indeed two delegations from the Fatah and Hamas movements in Cairo consulting and deliberating to quickly reach a mutual understanding regarding the management of daily affairs in the Gaza Strip under the full control of the Palestinian Authority,” Badr Abdelatty told a news conference in Cairo.Netanyahu previously voiced opposition to allowing the Palestinian Authority (PA) to take over Gaza. However, the US says it wants a “reformed” PA to be in charge of the Palestinian enclave.As the talks continued, Israeli forces have pressed on with the bombardment of Gaza, attacking Jabalia in the north and Abasan al-Kabira in the south.Northern Gaza has been particularly battered after Israel began besieging it 60 days ago. Gaza’s Government Media Office said at least 3,700 people have been killed or are missing since then.Israel’s offensive in Gaza – which United Nations experts have described as a genocide – has killed at least 44,466 Palestinians and wounded 105,358 since October 7, 2023.At least 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks that day, and more than 200 were taken captive.","Hamas says 33 captives killed in Gaza as Palestinian factions hold talks","2025-07-14T21:35:07.936919Z"

The road out of this crossing has not been safe for months. On 16 November, a large convoy of aid trucks was stolen by armed gangs,” UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini said in a post on X.“Yesterday, we tried to bring in a few food trucks on the same route. They were all taken,” he added, warning hunger was “rapidly deepening” in Gaza.Lazzarini listed how the humanitarian operation had become “unnecessarily impossible” due to “the ongoing siege, hurdles from Israeli authorities, political decisions to restrict the amounts of aid, lack of safety on aid routes and targeting of local police”.He called on Israel to ensure aid flowed to Gaza and said the country “must refrain from attacks on humanitarian workers”.On Thursday, the UN agency said “out of the 91 attempts the agency has made to deliver aid to besieged north Gaza between October 6 and November 25, 82 have been denied and 9 impeded.”Israel has been accused of using starvation as a weapon of war as it has restricted supplies of food, medicine and other essential items into Gaza since launching the war last October. More than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed in nonstop Israeli bombardment since then.Louise Wateridge, the UNRWA emergency officer, told Al Jazeera that the targeting of aid convoys has been happening since May.“That has led to desperation of people, who don’t have what they need and it has led and forced criminal activities,” she stressed.The pause in the delivery of aid also follows an Israeli attack on Saturday that killed three contractors of the US charity World Central Kitchen (WCK). The Israeli military claimed one of the contractors was involved in Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack.However, the WCK said it had “no knowledge that any individual in the vehicle had alleged ties” to the Hamas attack.The UN said last month that 333 aid workers had been killed since the start of the war in October of last year, 243 of them employees of UNRWA.Israel, which imposed a total siege on Gaza in the early stages of the war last year, blames the inability of relief organisations to handle and distribute large quantities of aid.Hamas’s Interior Ministry in Gaza have responded to the looting, saying more than 20 of the gang members suspected of carrying out the robbery had been killed by its security forces acting in coordination with tribal committees.Meanwhile, Palestinians in Gaza have told Al Jazeera of their confusion over how, in one of the most heavily surveilled territories on the planet, the presence of so many armed men could have gone undetected by Israeli forces.The Washington Post had previously reported that an internal UN memo from October said the gangs in Gaza “may be benefitting from a passive if not active benevolence” or “protection” from the Israeli army.One gang leader, the memo said, had established a “military-like compound” in an area “restricted, controlled and patrolled by the IDF (Israeli army)”.As this developed, Gaza’s civil defence agency reported that nearly 100 people were killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza in the last 24 hours.The casualties include those killed in an Israeli strike on a home belonging to the al-Araj family in the Tal az-Zaatar neighbourhood, which housed more than 40 people.Israel’s genocide in Gaza has killed at least 44,382 Palestinians and wounded 105,142 since October 7, 2023.

JDAMs convert “dumb” bombs into precision-guided weapons.The Biden administration has not confirmed the reports, the timing of which highlights the juxtaposition of the US position on the Middle East conflict – on the one hand facilitating ceasefire negotiations while on the other hand selling billions of dollars of munitions to Israel as it kills tens of thousands of Palestinians and Lebanese.On Tuesday, Biden – who has consistently supported Israel and portrays US arms sales to Israel as essential support for an ally – held an address at the White House announcing that a US-brokered ceasefire that would see Israel withdraw from Lebanon within 60 days had been reached. That deal went into effect early on Wednesday.During the address, Biden promised to again seek an end to the fighting that has raged in Gaza since October 7, 2023.For months, previous attempts by Washington to broker a deal have come up short with critics accusing Washington of failing to exert its most meaningful leverage – withholding some of the billions of dollars in arms it provides to Israel.To date, Israel has killed at least 44,282 Palestinians in Gaza since the war began when a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel killed at least 1,139 people. Israeli forces have killed more than 3,800 people in Lebanon in the past 13 months.“Over the coming days, the United States will make another push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza with the hostages released and the end to the war without Hamas in power – that it becomes possible,” Biden said.The latest weapons package would have been blocked as part of legislation introduced by several Democratic senators to stop about $20bn in arms sales to Israel, the Financial Times reported. However the effort, led by Senator Bernie Sanders, fell short of votes this month.For their part, US officials have repeatedly denied that delays in some arms transfers have been related to Israel’s actions beyond a pause this year of a shipment of 900kg (2,000lb) bombs in a fruitless effort to prevent Israel from launching a major ground operation in Rafah.Speaking to reporters after Biden’s speech, a US official denied that either withholding or promising more weapons to Israel was part of negotiations that eventually led to the Israel-Hezbollah agreement.The official said: “No part of this negotiation involved weapons on either side.”However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday appeared to offer a contradictory account, saying the ceasefire with Hezbollah was needed to “replenish stocks”, among other reasons.“And I say it openly: It is no secret that there have been big delays in weapons and munitions deliveries. These delays will be resolved soon,” Netanyahu said during a national address without specifically naming the US.“We will receive supplies of advanced weaponry that will keep our soldiers safe and give us more strike force to complete our mission.”Advocates said the latest approval from the Biden administration indicates there will be little change in the president’s policy before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20.In a post on X, the Institute for Middle East Understanding Policy Project said the move shows “President Biden is spending the final days of his presidency going against the will of most Americans, US law, and international law.”It noted that the small-diameter bombs and JDAMs reportedly provided in the package have been linked to Israeli attacks on civilians in Gaza.The Biden administration has also been one of the most vocal critics of the International Criminal Court’s (ICC’s) decision last week to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes committed in Gaza. The ICC also issued a warrant for Hamas leader Mohammed Deif, who Israel said it has killed.In a statement, Biden called the warrants against the Israeli officials “outrageous” and promised to “always stand with Israel against threats to its security”. Netanyahu’s office on Tuesday said it would appeal the court’s ruling.Trump is expected to take a more provocative stance against the ICC – and in his overall support for Israel – after he takes office with his Republican Party in control of both the US House of Representatives and Senate after the November 5 elections.Trump’s pick for national security adviser, Representative Mike Walz, has already promised a “strong response” to the ICC and the United Nations “come January”.Republican Senator Lindsey Graham went further, promising during a trip to Israel on Wednesday to introduce legislation that “would sanction any country that tried to enforce the arrest warrant against Israel”.“You could be a close ally – Canada, Britain, France, you name it – [but] if you buy into this arrest warrant as legitimate, then you’re going to meet stiff, bipartisan resistance in America,” Graham said. “So, to the world, if you empower this folly at the ICC, then you will have a hard time doing business in America and coming to America.”Netanyahu’s office confirmed that Graham had met with the Israeli leader during the trip.The prime minister’s office said Graham “updated him on the efforts that he is advancing in the US Congress against the ICC and countries that have cooperated with it”.","Biden OKs $680m Israel arms sale despite new Gaza ceasefire push: Reports","2025-06-28T10:42:15.224335Z"

They issued evacuation orders for Beirut’s southern suburbs, and attacks landed across the city, including metres from a Lebanese police base and the city’s largest public park.Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from Beirut on Monday, said Israeli attacks across Lebanon in recent days were “more powerful, more destructive, more frequent and happening more often without warning – leaving people no time to get out of the way of Israeli missiles and drones”.The barrages came as the Israeli ambassador to the United States said a ceasefire deal to end fighting between Israel and Lebanese group Hezbollah could be reached “within days”.Ambassador Mike Herzog told Israeli Army Radio on Monday that there remain “points to finalise” and any deal requires agreement from the government. But he said, “We are close to a deal”.Israeli officials said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet was set to convene on Tuesday to discuss a proposed ceasefire.Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said Israel would maintain an ability to strike southern Lebanon under any agreement. Lebanon has previously objected to wording that would grant Israel such a right.The US has pushed for a deal to end over a year of hostilities between Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel, which erupted in parallel with Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza and has drastically escalated over the last two months.In Beirut, Elias Bou Saab, Lebanon’s deputy parliament speaker, told the Reuters news agency there were “no serious obstacles” left to start implementing a US-proposed ceasefire with Israel, “unless Netanyahu changes his mind”.He said the proposal would entail an Israeli military withdrawal from south Lebanon and regular Lebanese soldiers deploying in the border region, long a Hezbollah stronghold, within 60 days.A sticking point on who would monitor compliance with the ceasefire had been resolved in the last 24 hours with an agreement to set up a five-country committee that includes France and is chaired by the US, he said.But Bou Saab also accused Israel of ramping up its bombardment in order to pressure Lebanon to make concessions in indirect ceasefire negotiations with Hezbollah because “we are close to the hour that is decisive regarding reaching a ceasefire”.After previous hopes for a ceasefire were dashed, US officials cautioned that negotiations were not yet complete and noted that there could be last-minute hitches that either delay or destroy an agreement.“We have made significant progress with getting towards a resolution,” US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters. “But we are not done yet. Nothing is final until everything is final.”The French presidency reported “significant progress” in talks on a ceasefire and urged Israel and Hezbollah to “seize this opportunity”.One far-right member of Netanyahu’s security cabinet, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, said he would oppose it. He said on X that a deal with Lebanon would be a “big mistake” and a “missed historic opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah”.But hostilities continue to intensify despite the reported diplomatic progress. Over the weekend, Israel carried out powerful attacks, one of which killed at least 29 people in central Beirut, while Hezbollah unleashed one of its biggest rocket salvos yet on Sunday, firing 250 missiles into Israel.Lebanon’s Health Ministry said Israeli attacks since October 2023 have killed 3,768 people in Lebanon and forced more than one million people from their homes.Hezbollah strikes have killed 45 civilians in northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. At least 73 Israeli soldiers have been killed in northern Israel, the Golan Heights and in combat in southern Lebanon, according to Israeli authorities.Al Jazeera’s Basravi said that in past conflicts with Israel, there had been a surge of violence on both sides of the border, followed by a cessation.“People are clinging to the hope that this is that moment,” he said.","Israel intensifies attacks on Lebanon but claims ceasefire deal ‘close’","2025-07-15T17:44:24.984367Z"

Of those who had been abused physically, injuries around the head, shoulders and, in the cases of men, from between the legs and the bottom are fairly common,” Ansari added.She detailed the case of one paramedic who told HRW of having encountered another detainee, bleeding from his anus, who described how three Israeli guards had taken it in turns to rape him with their M16 rifles. Responding to accusations of overcrowding from the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security agency in July, Ben-Gvir boasted of the abominable conditions in his prison systems, writing on X: “Since I assumed the position of minister of national security, one of the highest goals I have set for myself is to worsen the conditions of the terrorists in the prisons and to reduce their rights to the minimum required by law.”Earlier the same week, he released a video saying: “Prisoners should be shot in the head instead of being given more food.”“It was bad, it’s always been bad,” Abbas told Al Jazeera, “But things became really serious after Ben-Gvir’s appointment. Since October, it’s been like another world. It’s been horrifying.“Before the war, there were hundreds of Palestinian prisoners with chronic diseases. Now there are thousands more people in detention, which means many more with chronic conditions, who are going untreated.”In July, following arrests of Israeli soldiers accused of systematic torture and rape at the Sde Teiman detention facility, Israeli protesters – elected politicians among them – stormed Sde Teiman and the nearby Beit Lid base demanding the release of the arrested soldiers.Writing to Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu afterwards, Ben-Gvir decried the soldiers’ arrest for rape and torture as “shameful”, saying of conditions in his prison system: “The summer camps and patience for the terrorists are over.”According to a statement given to the United Kingdom’s Sky News by the Israeli military, Dr Al-Bursh was taken from Al-Awda to Sde Teiman.About a quarter of the 100 or so detainees at Sde Teiman were healthcare workers, another inmate, Dr Khalid Hamouda estimated.","Dying in ‘Hell’: The fate of Palestinian medics jailed by Israel","2025-07-15T17:50:37.206468Z"

One less #MuslimTerror ist. #FireAway,” Fine wrote in a social media post in September.Eygi was taking part in a peaceful protest when she was shot. Both Israel and the outgoing administration of US President Joe Biden have dismissed her killing as an accident.Fine’s post – which X (formerly Twitter) found to be in violation of its violent speech policy – is part of a long list of inflammatory, anti-Palestinian and Islamophobic comments by the state legislator.“Fine is a friend to no one except fascism,” Rasha Mubarak, a Palestinian-American activist from Florida, told Al Jazeera.“Trump’s endorsement signals a deepening alignment with the violent, fascist elements within the capitalist class, whose interests are served by sowing division and perpetuating the dominance of imperialism.”Fine often proclaims that the US has a “Muslim problem”. In 2021, when told by a social media user that Palestinians were being forced out of their homes by Israel, he responded with: “#BlowThemUp”.According to the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), he also sent a private message to a Florida resident saying: “Go blow yourself up!”Two years earlier, Fine referred to Jews who support Palestinian rights as “Judenrat” – Nazi collaborators.Last year, Fine argued that fear of Muslims is justified.“While many Muslims are not terrorists, they are the radicals, not the mainstream,” he wrote in a post on X. “Now is the time to speak truth, not bathe in political correctness that will kill us.”Fine’s office did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s response for comment.Over the years, CAIR has called on Florida lawmakers to censure and penalise Fine, including over his recent comments on Eygi’s killing.“We struggle to think of another time in modern American history when an elected official openly celebrated the murder of an American by a foreign government and encouraged more such killing,” CAIR’s deputy executive director, Edward Ahmed Mitchell, said in May.“Randy Fine has made it clear where his priorities lie, and it is not with the American people. We urge the Florida House of Representatives to censure him for this hateful, un-American rant.”Despite celebrating the killing of an American woman by a foreign military, Trump described Fine as an “America First Patriot”.He called on him to run for the seat of Congressman Mike Waltz, who will leave his seat to serve in the White House as national security adviser.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will call for a special election to fill the vacancy next year.Fine, who previously served in Florida’s House of Representatives and was recently elected to the state’s Senate, has not announced his candidacy, but he welcomed Trump’s statement.“It would be the honor of my life to be one of your footsoldiers,” he wrote, addressing the incoming president. “Your confidence is overwhelming and I will have news to share soon!”Trump himself has regularly spread anti-Muslim rhetoric, including saying that the Quran, Islam’s holy book, teaches a “very negative vibe” and proclaiming that “Islam hates us”.He also imposed a travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries during his first term as president.But this year, the former president softened his tone as he courted Arab and Muslim voters, promising to bring “peace” to the Middle East.Trump’s endorsement of Fine as well as some of his staunchly pro-Israel cabinet picks highlights the depth of his alliance with far-right forces.","Trump backs staunchly anti-Muslim Florida lawmaker to run for US Congress","2025-07-14T22:06:18.474991Z"

The other deaths were recorded in central and southern Gaza.Israeli air raids caused significant damage to al-Faruq Mosque in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to a social media video verified by Al Jazeera.Israeli forces also deepened their ground offensive and bombardment of northern Gaza, where one of the last partially operating hospitals was hit, wounding several workers.Hussam Abu Safia, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital, said in a statement on Saturday that Israeli forces “directly targeted the entrance to the emergency and reception area several times, as well as the hospital courtyards, electrical generators, and hospital gates”.The bombardment “resulted in 12 injuries among doctors, nurses, and administrative staff within the emergency and reception areas”, he said.The Israeli military rejected the allegations and said it was “not aware of a strike in the area of the Kamal Adwan Hospital” following an initial review of the situation.On Friday, Gaza’s Ministry of Health said hospitals have fuel left for only about two days before it needs to start restricting services.Israel’s military imposed a siege and launched a renewed ground offensive in northern Gaza last month, saying it aimed to stop Hamas fighters from waging more attacks and regrouping in the area.The United Nations warned earlier this week that almost no aid had been delivered to northern Gaza since Israel’s renewed offensive as aid groups and food security experts warn of a famine in the area.In a call with Defence Minister Israel Katz on Saturday, United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin pressed Israel to “take steps to improve the dire humanitarian condition in Gaza”, the Pentagon said.Israel’s assault on Gaza has killed more than 44,000 people and wounded more than 104,000 since October 2023, according to Palestinian health officials.Israel launched its assault on Gaza after the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, in which at least 1,139 people were killed and about 250 others seized as captives.A spokesperson for the armed wing of Hamas, Abu Ubaida, said later on Saturday that a female Israeli captive in the group’s custody had been killed in northern Gaza in an area under attack by Israel’s forces.“The life of another female prisoner who used to be with her remains in imminent danger,” he added, accusing the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being responsible and of undermining efforts to end the war.","More than 100 Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza in 48 hours","2025-07-15T20:48:05.870628Z"

He argued that the measures aim to apply US laws that prohibit military assistance to countries that block humanitarian aid and commit abuses.“A lot of folks come to the floor to talk about human rights and what’s going on around the world, but what I want to say to all those folks: Nobody is going to take anything you say with a grain of seriousness,” Sanders said.“You cannot condemn human rights [violations] around the world and then turn a blind eye to what the United States government is now funding in Israel. People will laugh in your face. They will say to you, ‘You’re concerned about China; you’re concerned about Russia; you’re concerned about Iran. Well, why are you funding the starvation of children in Gaza right now?”Senator Jacky Rosen, a staunchly pro-Israel Democrat, spoke out against the resolutions, arguing that restrictions on aid to Israel would empower Iran and its allies in the region.“Israel has an absolute right to defend itself, and the aid provided by America is critical,” Rosen said.If the bills had passed the Senate, they would have needed to be approved by the House of Representatives and Biden, who would have almost certainly refused to sign them.A presidential veto can be overturned with a two-thirds majority in the House and the Senate.Several Democrats in the House of Representatives had voiced support for the JRDs.Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and eight other lawmakers said in a joint statement: “President-elect Trump’s return to the White House will only embolden Netanyahu and his far-right ministers. A vote for the joint resolutions of disapproval is a vote to politically restrain the Netanyahu government from any forthcoming efforts to formally annex the West Bank and settle parts of Gaza.”Miller, of Jewish Voice for Peace, said lawmakers had ethical, legal and political obligations to vote in favour of the resolutions.“There is a moral obligation for them to stop arming a genocide. There is a legal obligation for them to follow US law and stop sending weapons to a government that is using our equipment in violation of our own law. And there is a political obligation for them to do what their constituents are telling them to do,” she said.","US Senate votes down effort to withhold weapons to Israel amid Gaza war","2025-06-28T10:50:53.686726Z"

Biden later undid the reversal.The Republican president-elect also recently selected former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee — a Christian evangelical who once said there is “no such thing as a West Bank” — as the US ambassador to Israel.“It’s Judea and Samaria,” Huckabee said in 2017, referring to the biblical name of the territory regularly used by far-right Israeli officials and settlers.“There’s no such thing as a settlement. They’re communities, they’re neighbourhoods, they’re cities. There’s no such thing as an occupation,” he said.Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has tapped American-Israeli Yechiel Leiter – another staunch supporter of the settlements – to be Israel’s ambassador to the US when Trump takes office.Israeli daily Haaretz reported that Leiter was a former member of the hardline ultranationalist Jewish Defense League, which has been linked to violent attacks on US soil and is designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.Leiter’s appointment is “an indication of where Netanyahu’s going” with Trump set to enter the White House, Michael Omer-Man, director of Israel-Palestine research at the think tank Democracy for the Arab World Now, told Al Jazeera last week.“We’re going to see a lot more of these signals,” he added. “The intention is to simply go way further than they did in the first Trump term.”","Biden issues more Israeli settler sanctions ahead of Trump term","2025-06-28T09:53:11.124832Z"

According to Palestinian health officials, more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed since the renewed offensive began last month.Israel has killed at least 43,922 Palestinians since it launched its devastating assault on Gaza on October 7, 2023. That followed a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, in which 1,139 people were killed.Along with stepping up the bombardment, the Israeli army has issued new waves of forced displacement orders for residents of northern Gaza.But many Palestinians have refused to leave despite the catastrophic humanitarian conditions and the near-daily shelling. Some fear that if they leave northern Gaza, they risk being attacked by Israeli soldiers and snipers.Health officials say the siege has crippled the healthcare system in northern Gaza and is also blocking medical teams from reaching bombarded sites.Israel has banned UNRWA from operating in the country and has cut ties with it, claiming the organisation has ties to Hamas, which UNRWA denies. The agency cautioned on Monday that a halt to its activities in Israel and occupied East Jerusalem would block it from coordinating massive aid efforts inside Gaza.“There is no plan B,” UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland on Monday.The only alternative to UNRWA’s work in Gaza is to allow Israel to run services there, Lazzarini said, repeating calls for countries to resist the Israeli ban on the organisation, which is set to come into effect in January.Lazzarini is in Geneva for a strategy meeting with donors. The ban, he said, is one of the darkest moments in the agency’s history.“I have drawn the attention of the member states that now the clock is ticking … We have to stop or prevent the implementation of this bill,” he told reporters.The ordered suspension of the agency sparked global condemnation, including from key Israeli ally the United States.UNRWA provides assistance to nearly six million Palestinian refugees across Gaza, the occupied West Bank, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.","Large food convoy violently looted in Gaza, UNRWA says","2025-07-14T21:55:18.915177Z"

In a letter signed by more than 100 groups in September, they warned that the bill “raises significant constitutional concerns” and that because it vests “vast unilateral discretion in the Secretary of Treasury, it creates a high risk of politicized and discriminatory enforcement”.Now that Trump is headed back to the White House — prompting widespread fears of an impending crackdown on civil rights — advocates warned the legislation could empower the incoming administration with an incredibly dangerous tool to crack down on dissent with few checks and balances.“This is much more of a real threat right now,” Kia Hamadanchy, a senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, told Al Jazeera ahead of Tuesday’s House vote. “We know that Trump is going to be president. I don’t know if it’s the time to give him additional authority.”Losing nonprofit status, Hamadanchy said, would threaten many organisations’ financial viability by depriving them of tax exemptions. While targeted organisations would have a 90-day window to challenge the designation, they would not necessarily be provided with the underlying evidence used to make the determination against them.“The entire process is run at the sole discretion of the secretary of [the] treasury,” said Hamadanchy. “So you could have your nonprofit status revoked before you ever have a chance to have a hearing.”But being unilaterally declared as “pro-terrorist” has even broader implications, he added.“You have the stigma of being designated a terror-supporting organisation,” Hamadanchy said. “You have all the legal fees costs you’re going to incur from having to actually go to court to fight this, and you have donors who might be running away from you because they don’t want to deal with the controversy, they might be afraid that if they donate money to you they’re going to be accused of providing material support to a terror group.”The bill also included a measure that would offer tax relief to US citizens who are being held captive by “terror groups” or who are unjustly imprisoned abroad.By combining both provisions under the same legislation — with the second one a politically popular one across both parties — the bill’s sponsors were hoping to rush it through with as little opposition as possible, critics said.But the more insidious element of the bill, the one targeting nonprofits, doubled down on existing legislation.Providing “material support” for US-designated “terror” groups is already against the law, noted Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace.“It’s already illegal for [nonprofits] to support terror and the Department of Justice actually has a path to say, ‘This is illegal, and this is a foreign terrorist organisation, and here’s our proof,’” she told Al Jazeera. “And it’s accountable: they can take your nonprofit status away, but there’s actual due process.”Congressman David Kustoff, a Republican and a co-sponsor of the bill, argued when he first introduced the legislation that the current process is insufficient.“Right now, our ability to crack down on tax-exempt organisations that support terrorism is inadequate,” Kustoff said in April. “Doing so, under current law, requires a time-consuming bureaucratic process that has sometimes prevented federal authorities from acting.”But removing checks and balances from the process could turn the legislation into a weapon to be deployed against any group the administration in office may not like.When the bill was first introduced, it generated pushback from across the political spectrum, Friedman noted.“Including from the right that said, ‘Well, if this is in the hands of a government that’s anti the things we care about, this could hurt us,’” she said. “Are we at a point now where Republicans have decided there will never again be a government that could come back to bite them so they’re going to support unlimited anything? I don’t know. Trump could do all of this by executive order anyway.”But critics had expressed hope that Trump’s re-election would have Democrats in Congress on the lookout for measures, like this one, that could empower him further.“The MAGA crackdown on free speech is already starting in Congress,” Eva Borgwardt, a national spokesperson for the IfNotNow Movement, wrote in a statement. “It is unconscionable that any Democrat would sign over these sweeping powers to a Trump administration hellbent on destroying not only groups working for peace, equality and justice, but also any semblance of democratic dissent in this country.”Basim Elkarra, executive director of CAIR Action, also had warned that the bill “would set a dangerous precedent, allowing the government to silence and disband organisations on a whim, with no real oversight or accountability”.“Organisations advocating for Palestinian rights may be the first targeted,” echoed Chris Habiby, advocacy director at the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee.“But they will not be the last.”","US House fails to pass anti-NGO bill that could target pro-Palestine groups","2025-07-15T17:50:49.472670Z"

While Israel’s military claims evacuation orders are aimed at protecting Lebanon’s civilian population, in reality, evacuation orders are not always made.The Israeli military said that in its latest attacks, it had struck Hezbollah infrastructure in the areas of Tyre and Baalbek, including fighters, “operational apartments,” and weapons stores.In retaliation, Hezbollah said it launched rocket attacks on Israeli forces in the town of Shebaa in southern Lebanon and the settlement of HaGoshrim in northern Israel. The attacks took place in the early hours of Sunday morning.Israel has been fighting with Hezbollah since October 2023, but it has escalated dramatically since late September of this year. Israel has intensified and expanded its bombing campaign, and Hezbollah has ramped up daily rocket and drone attacks against Israel.At least 3,189 people have been killed and 14,078 wounded in Israeli attacks in Lebanon since the war on Gaza began.Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of Hamas and in solidarity with the people of Gaza, where Israel’s war continues to rage.

Humanitarians are not able to do their work in safety.”Anas al-Sharif, Al Jazeera’s reporter in northern Gaza, said on Friday, “We are being annihilated in front of the world.”Earlier this week, as reported by the UK’s Guardian newspaper, Israel’s military spokesperson Itzik Cohen said no one would be allowed to return to their homes in the devastated reaches of Gaza’s north. Cohen also reportedly said aid would only be allowed to enter Gaza’s south.Israeli officials have since tried to distance themselves from those statements.But aid agencies, rights groups and observers say Israel appears to be employing a so-called “General’s Plan”, a controversial strategy touted by a retired member of the Israeli military, suggesting the army forcibly empties Gaza’s north of its entire population and regard anyone remaining as an enemy combatant.At the time of publishing, the Israeli army had not replied to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.Hamas has accused Israel of “massacres which amount to ethnic cleansing, alongside a complete siege on northern Gaza”.UNRWA said 69,000 people remain in Gaza’s north. Other estimates suggest the current population there is closer to 100,000.Since early October, northern Gaza has been in a state of continuous siege. Hundreds of civilians, including children, have been killed.No food or aid has been allowed in. The Israeli army is laying waste to what remained of the towns and villages that had once been home to thousands of Palestinian families.Tens of thousands of civilians still in the area are trying to survive daily threats of bombing, shelling, sniper fire and the prospect of imminent starvation.The Israeli army is trying to force them out, sending evacuation orders via social media messages and flyers. Overhead warnings are reportedly delivered by drones, urging them to flee south where conditions are relatively safer but still perilous. Food is also scarce in the south, bombings are relentless and hospitals are barely functioning.“Across northern Gaza, there is no way of telling where the destruction starts or ends,” said Louise Wateridge, senior emergency officer at UNRWA, from the agency’s mission in Gaza’s north.“As far as the eye can see, homes, hospitals, schools, mosques, restaurants – everything has been completely flattened. Only the carcass of [Gaza City] is left, with the entire society becoming a graveyard.”Despite Israeli claims to the contrary, aid agencies insist that all attempts to deliver food to people in the besieged areas of the North Gaza governorate have been blocked by the Israeli authorities.Healthcare conditions remain critical.The Kamal Adwan Hospital, the last functioning medical facility in the besieged north, has been hit by Israeli fire twice in the past week. The delivery of life-saving supplies to the al-Awda Hospital has been denied, agencies have said.The conditions are “beyond appalling”, Wateridge told Al Jazeera via WhatsApp.She said that at a school that has been converted into a makeshift shelter, “sewage is streaming down the walls”.“If people are not killed by bombs today, they will be killed by disease tomorrow,” she said.Analysts interviewed by Al Jazeera have termed Israel’s plan to forcibly displace thousands of people from northern Gaza as “ethnic cleansing”.“The world must stop standing by while Israel uses siege, starvation and atrocity crimes to forcibly displace and destroy civilians and civilian life,” said Amnesty’s Middle East and North Africa’s director, Heba Morayet, in a statement.Jeremy Corbyn, long a supporter of Palestinian rights and the former leader of the United Kingdom’s Labour Party, said Israel’s campaign in the north was a “textbook definition of ethnic cleansing”.Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said hospitals in northern Gaza are being “targeted with an intensity rarely seen in modern warfare”.Rohan Talbot, at the Medical Aid Palestinians charity, posted a map of new evacuation orders on X on Friday. “The ethnic cleansing of Northern Gaza was the proof of concept. The push on Gaza City is next. The genocide won’t stop until it is forced to stop.”Gaza itself remains an effective prison, with residents blocked by the Israeli army from leaving the enclave to seek food, medicine and shelter – or to escape its blockade.But even moving around within Gaza is filled with risk and challenges. Functioning transport remains out of reach for most. Some families have travelled by foot in a desperate attempt to flee, a few using donkey carts during their displacement.They are attempting to reach the Netzarim Corridor, which can take hours. Once there, they wait even longer to begin the protracted process of passing Israeli security checks to reach the south.But many in Gaza’s north believe fleeing south would not offer much respite.“What is there [in the south] for families to leave for?” Wateridge said. “Disease is spreading; there is limited food; thousands of families are crammed on top of each other in horrendous shelter conditions.“At this point, the reality is 2.2 million people are exhausted from 13 months of displacement, and trapped within pockets of the Gaza Strip, prevented from fleeing to any real safety.”Israeli troops have split the enclave in two, and control all travel between each side.The four-kilometre (2.5-mile) deep and heavily fortified Netzarim Corridor runs across the Gaza Strip, stretching from the Israeli border to the Mediterranean.The establishment of the corridor that bisects Gaza occurred in stages, beginning in October and concluding with its formal establishment in late November.In April, retired National Security Adviser General Giora Eiland drafted the outline of a plan that would essentially cleanse northern Gaza of its entire population under the guise of fighting a resurgent Hamas in the region.Under its terms, the population of northern Gaza would be given one week to flee, before being considered enemy combatants by Israeli forces.From that point, all access to the isolated north would be halted in a further bid to pressure Hamas to release the remaining Israeli captives, but also to gain indefinite control over northern Gaza, effectively dividing the Gaza Strip.Washington has said it rejects the plan, while Israel officially denies it is carrying it out.The Times of Israel reported that in mid-September, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was considering the plan. But when asked by US officials to publicly reject the plan, Netanyahu is reported to have demurred.","Israel’s new tactics in north Gaza stoke fears of ethnic cleansing campaign","2025-07-15T19:37:06.124990Z"

Here’s what you should know.Gallant and Netanyahu’s relationship was fractious before October 7.In March 2023, Netanyahu was facing mass protests due to his plans to weaken the judiciary.At the time, Gallant criticised Netanyahu during a televised address, arguing that the proposed judicial reforms endangered national security by deepening political divisions within security branches.Critics and analysts said the judicial reforms would effectively curb the powers of the Supreme Court and embolden the legislative and executive branches of government.They accused Netanyahu, who was facing corruption charges and implicated in a bribery scandal, of pushing through these reforms to evade criminal prosecution.In July, Gallant called for the establishment of an independent inquiry to investigate the Hamas-led attack on October 7 and security failures that day.He said his role, the failures of the Israeli army, those of Netanyahu, as well as the culpability of the internal security agency Shin Bet should be probed.But Netanyahu had long obstructed calls for an international or state-led inquiry, arguing that a commission should be established only after the war in Gaza, so that soldiers do not have to “hire lawyers” while fighting on the battlefield.Critics have said Netanyahu is opposed to establishing a commission because it would reveal his role in strengthening Hamas at the expense of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which controls large swathes of the West Bank as part of the Oslo Accords – a failed peace agreement inked between Palestinian and Israeli leaders in 1993.“We need an investigation at the national level that will clarify the facts – a state commission of inquiry,” Gallant said on a podium during a graduation ceremony for new army officers.“It must examine all of us: the decision-makers and professionals, the government, the army and security services, this government – and the governments over the last decade that led to the events of October 7,” he added as the crowd applauded.One of the largest disputes between Gallant and Netanyahu was over securing a permanent ceasefire deal in Gaza in order to retrieve the remaining captives held by Hamas.Netanyahu approved a temporary ceasefire deal back in November 2023, which led to the release of 105 Israeli captives in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.But since then, Netanyahu has effectively torpedoed every single ceasefire proposal in order to prolong the war in Gaza and his political career, analysts and critics have previously told Al Jazeera.On July 31, Hamas’s political chief and lead negotiator Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated.Haniyeh was killed while attending the inauguration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in the capital Tehran.While Gallant did not denounce the assassination, which has been blamed on Israel, he has repeatedly called for a deal to retrieve the Israeli captives.Israeli families of the captives believe that Gallant’s dismissal is further proof that Netanyahu is undermining a ceasefire deal.As part of any ceasefire deal, Gallant stressed that Israel should promote or encourage a new Palestinian faction to control Gaza in a “day after” scenario.The United States has long called on a reformed PA, headed by Mahmoud Abbas, to return to Gaza and assume governance. The PA was first pushed out of Gaza following an inter-factional war with Hamas in 2007.Despite objections from the US and from his own security officials, Netanyahu has said that Israel will remain in full military control of Gaza and the West Bank.In May, Gallant publicly condemned Netanyahu’s plan and said that he would “not agree to the establishment of Israeli military rule in Gaza”.Netanyahu has dismissed Gallant’s remarks and repeatedly promised to achieve “total victory” against Hamas in Gaza.In August, Gallant described this war aim and rhetoric as “nonsense”.","Israel’s wartime row: What’s behind the rift between Netanyahu and Gallant?","2025-07-14T21:36:09.058308Z"

He has held various ministerial portfolios since 2003, including agriculture, transportation, intelligence, energy, finance and twice, foreign affairs.Katz was born in 1955 in the city of Ashkelon, a city built not far from the Palestinian village Majdal which was depopulated in the 1948 Nakba.Katz joined the military in 1973 where he served as a paratrooper for four years. After his discharge, he studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.He unsuccessfully ran for a seat in Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, in 1992 and again in 1996. In 1998, he finally won a seat and has since served on several committees.In 2007, Israeli police suggested he be tried for fraud and breach of trust for political appointments while he was agriculture minister. The investigation was closed by the then-attorney general.Some of his decisions in government have been deemed beneficial to Israel’s hyper-conservative Orthodox community and the country’s far-right settlers. He is largely seen as a figure who will be subservient to Netanyahu’s vision for the country and the wider region, which analysts say could include further displacement and ethnic cleansing in Gaza and the West Bank and the depopulation of southern Lebanon.Unlike Gallant, Katz is a relatively peripheral figure in United States-Israeli relations.Gallant had come to be relied on by the Biden administration as a voice of reason who was focused on returning the Israeli captives in Gaza and ending the war.Katz, in contrast, has regularly clashed with the United Nations. He was one of the architects behind Israel’s push to get the international community to defund the UNRWA, which the Knesset banned from working in East Jerusalem last month.In October, he announced that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was unwelcome in Israel. He tweeted a photoshopped image of Guterres kneeling in front of the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khameini.Katz is seen as antagonistic to Palestinians in general and the Palestinian Authority (PA), in particular.As far back as 2011, he called for cutting off relations with the PA. More recently, he promised to “break and dissolve” the PA if the UN moved forwards with resolutions against Israel.In August, he called for the eviction of Palestinians from the occupied West Bank.“We need to address the [terror] threat exactly as we deal with terror infrastructure in Gaza, including the temporary evacuation of Palestinian civilians and any other step needed,” he said at the time.He has previously used the threat of another Nakba against the Palestinians as well.In 2022, addressing the Knesset, Katz said, “Yesterday I warned the Arab students, who are flying Palestine flags at universities: Remember 48. Remember our independence war and your Nakba, don’t stretch the rope too much. […] If you don’t calm down, we’ll teach you a lesson that won’t be forgotten.”","Who Is Israel Katz, Israel’s new defence minister?","2025-06-24T20:15:24.898016Z"

Harris called Iran the “greatest adversary” of the US last month while Trump advocated for Israel hitting Iranian nuclear facilities.At the same time, both have signalled that they will be willing to engage diplomatically with Iran.Speaking to reporters in New York in September, Trump said he was open to restarting negotiations on a nuclear deal. “We have to make a deal because the consequences are impossible. We have to make a deal,” he said.Harris has previously also supported a return to nuclear talks although her tone towards Iran has hardened more recently.According to Tehran-based political analyst Diako Hosseini, the big question for Iran amid all of this is which of the two presidential candidates might be more prepared to manage tensions.“Trump provides excessive support to Israel while Harris is highly committed to the mainstream US agenda against Iran,” he told Al Jazeera.The history of the two candidates will also heavily impact their potential future relations with Tehran.A year after becoming president in 2017, Trump unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, imposing the harshest-ever US sanctions on Iran, which encompassed its entire economy.He also ordered the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top general and its second most powerful man after the supreme leader. Soleimani, the commander-in-chief of the Quds Force of the IRGC, was killed along with a senior Iraqi commander by a US drone in Iraq in January 2020.After taking office in January 2021, the current US president, Joe Biden, and Harris continued with the enforcement of Trump’s sanctions, including during the years when Iran was dealing with the deadliest outbreak of COVID-19 in the Middle East, which killed close to 150,000 people.The Biden administration has also considerably added to those sanctions, blacklisting many dozens more individuals and entities with the announced aim of targeting Iranian exports, limiting its military capabilities and punishing human rights abuses.After an Iranian missile attack on Israel last month, Washington expanded sanctions on Iran’s petroleum and petrochemical sectors to negatively impact its crude exports to China, which had rebounded and grew over the past few years despite the sanctions.Trump has claimed he will choke off resilient Iranian exports through better enforcement of the sanctions.“Pursuing diplomacy with Trump is much harder for Iran due to the assassination of General Soleimani, but it’s not impossible,” Hosseini said.“However, if a potential Harris administration is willing, Iran would not have any major obstacles for direct bilateral talks. Nevertheless, Iran is well and realistically aware that regardless of who takes over the White House as president, diplomacy with Washington is now considerably much more difficult than any other time.”Since the US withdrawal from the landmark nuclear accord, all dialogue with the US – including failed efforts to revive the comatose nuclear agreement and a prisoner exchange deal last year – has been held indirectly and through intermediaries like Qatar and Oman.The government of President Masoud Pezeshkian, comprised of representatives from reformist to hardline political factions within the Iranian establishment, has tried to strike a tone that projects both moderation and strength.Pezeshkian said in a speech on Monday that Iran has been engaged in an “all-out economic war” and must stand up to its opponents by boosting its local economy. He has also repeatedly said he wants to work to get the sanctions removed and is open to talks with the West.“It is strange that the Zionist regime and its backers keep making claims about human rights. Violence, genocide, crimes and murder are behind their apparently neat facade and neckties,” the president said during his latest speech.Speaking to state television on Monday night, Iran’s top diplomat said Tehran “does not put that much value” into who wins the presidential race in the US.“The country’s main strategies will not be impacted by these things. Tactics might change, and things might be accelerated or delayed, but we will never compromise on our fundamentals and goals,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said.Araghchi travelled to Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, on Tuesday, where he discussed the “threats posed by the Zionist regime and the regional crisis” with top officials, including army chief General Asim Munir.The IRGC continues to carry out a large-scale military operation in the southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchistan bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, where there have recently been multiple armed attacks by a separatist group that Iran believes is backed by Israel.The Jaish al-Adl group killed 10 members of the Iranian armed forces in the province on October 26 in a strike condemned by the United Nations Security Council as a “heinous and cowardly terrorist attack”.Since the attack, the IRGC said it has killed eight members of the group and arrested 14.","Iran’s big question about US election: Will Trump or Harris seek diplomacy?","2025-06-28T10:03:52.664202Z"

We’re frustrated. We’re angry. We’re heartbroken. We feel betrayed,” Elabed said, finally taking a breath as she reflected on Israel’s raging wars on Gaza and Lebanon.And now, with bombs still raining down, she added that Arab American voters were being asked to hit pause on their sorrow and cast a ballot on Tuesday for presidential candidates who do not have a plan “to stop the killing”.It is a sentiment that reverberates across the large Arab American community in the battleground state of Michigan, where Elabed has been a leader in the Uncommitted Movement, which has aimed to pressure United States President Joe Biden and his vice president and Democratic contender, Kamala Harris, to end their unwavering support for Israel.Harris has promised to continue arming Israel while her Republican rival, Donald Trump, has a staunchly pro-Israel record despite his claims of wanting to bring “peace” to the region.Draped in a scarf featuring Palestinian embroidery, known as “tatreez”, Elabed told Al Jazeera that she was leaving the top of the ticket blank.“I’m skipping it because neither Vice President Harris nor Donald Trump has adopted a policy that clearly says the bombs are going to stop,” said the Detroit area resident, who is a mother of three and the 12th of 14 children of Palestinian immigrants.Other Arab Americans, however, are making different choices.Some are backing Harris, arguing that despite her pledge to sustain the flow of US weapons to Israel, the Democrat remains a better choice than Trump on domestic and foreign policy.Others see Trump’s unpredictability and self-proclaimed status as an antiwar candidate as an opportunity to break away from the Democratic Party and penalise Harris.Elabed belongs to the third camp: those who argue that neither candidate deserves the community’s votes.But even within that approach, there are divisions. Some are calling for skipping the presidential race altogether, while others are campaigning for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.Overall, however, there seems to be little enthusiasm across the board, underscoring the dilemma Arab Americans face as they struggle to agree on a strategy that could help influence the election and end the US-backed Israeli wars, which have so far killed more than 43,000 people in Gaza and nearly 3,000 in Lebanon.Alissa Hakim, a Lebanese American university graduate, said she has “no hope whatsoever” about the vote.Hakim in 2020 cast her first-ever vote in a presidential election, voting for Biden who she believed would be better than Trump. But after four years and a war that many experts have described as a genocide, the 22-year-old said she firmly rejected the “lesser of two evils” argument.“There’s been such a low bar for our presidential candidates that you want us to vote for you just because you’re not the other person,” said Hakim, sitting in a Yemeni coffee shop with a laptop featuring stickers of the map of historic Palestine.“It’s made me realise, we need to respect ourselves more than to just sell our vote to whoever says the nicer words,” she told Al Jazeera.While Hakim remains undecided, she said her vote would certainly not go for either Trump or Harris.In Dearborn, a city of 110,000 people known as the Capital of Arab America, both major campaigns are trying to reach out in various ways but their efforts do not appear to be producing a decisive outcome.With Election Day approaching, Al Jazeera surveyed dozens of residential neighbourhoods in the heavily Arab east side of the city. Signs for school board candidates and Lebanese and Palestinian flags far outnumbered signs for the two major presidential hopefuls.Biden won more than 80 percent of the votes in predominantly Arab precincts in Dearborn in 2020, according to the city’s election data, helping him win Michigan.This time, however, Harris is facing an uphill battle in the local community. Even Arab Americans who backed the Democrat in interviews with Al Jazeera have voiced frustration with her positions and acknowledged her campaign’s shortcomings.Last week, former President Bill Clinton said at a Harris rally in Michigan that Hamas “forces” Israel to kill civilians. He also suggested that Zionism predated Islam in comments that stirred outrage among Arab and Muslim groups.Harris has also refused to meet advocates from the Uncommitted Movement after her campaign rejected the group’s demand to allow a speech by a Palestinian representative at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August.At a campaign stop in Michigan on Sunday, Harris was asked if she had a closing case to make to Arab Americans. She said she hoped “to earn” the votes of the community and repeated her position about the “need to end the war” on Gaza and secure the release of dozens of people held captive in the besieged territory.Ali Dagher, a local Democratic activist who signed a letter by prominent Arab Americans endorsing Harris, said the community was in “shock” and “deep depression” over the carnage in Gaza and Lebanon.Dagher told Al Jazeera that endorsing Harris was done in partnership with other groups, including civil rights advocates and labour organisations that see Trump as a threat.“Another presidency under Donald Trump would be a greater danger, not just on international policy… but also on a domestic level – about human rights, about civil rights, about the environment,” Dagher said.He acknowledged that voting for Harris was a “very tough pill to swallow”, but said the decision was made on the premise that Arab American Democrats would work with their allies to push her to shift US policy on Israel and Palestine.Some Arab Americans, however, advocate for a divorce from the Democrats altogether, arguing that working within the party’s system has proven futile.“You do not do the same thing over and over and expect different results,” Hamtramck Mayor Amer Ghalib said at an Al Jazeera town hall in Dearborn earlier this week.Ghalib, one of the local Arab American officials to have endorsed Trump, said he had opened the channels of communications before the war broke out in an attempt to end the disconnect with the Republican Party after years of political engagement with the Democrats only.Arab Americans were not always considered a Democrat-leaning constituency. Many Arab voters in the Detroit area backed Republican President George W Bush in 2000. But the 2003 US-led war on Iraq and the so-called “war on terror” shifted the community’s support to the Democratic Party – and not just on the presidential level.Numerous Arab American politicians in southeast Michigan have been elected to public office as Democrats, including Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib as well as several county commissioners and state lawmakers.But those same Democratic officials, including Tlaib and Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, who have both served in Michigan’s House of Representatives, have refused to publicly back Harris over the war – signalling yet another shift.Harris has welcomed the endorsement of Republican former Vice President Dick Cheney – an architect of the post-9/11 era that drove Arab Americans to the Democrats – and campaigned with his daughter, Liz Cheney.That embrace did not sit well with many in the area, and Republicans are trying to capitalise on that discontent.“Kamala is campaigning with Muslim-hating warmonger Liz Cheney, who wants to invade practically every Muslim country on the planet,” Trump said at a rally in Michigan in October. “And let me tell you, the Muslims of our country, they see it and they know it.”A Republican-linked campaign has been aggressively targeting Arab Americans in Michigan with advertisements and text messages highlighting Harris’s ties to the Cheneys as well as her pro-Israel record.“I’m a volunteer helping elect pro-Israel candidates. Our records show you support VP Harris. Thats [sic] great,” a text message sent to Dearborn residents on Sunday read.“We need her to continue Biden’s policy of sending aid to Israel so they can continue to [stand] up to terrorism in the Middle East. Do you agree?”Conversely, Emgage PAC – a Muslim political group backing Harris – has sent mailers to voters in the Detroit area underscoring Trump’s pro-Israel policies and his close relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Still, faced with “impossible choices”, many voters say they are not convinced by either effort.As Trump met a group of Arab Americans in Dearborn on Friday, Leila Alamri, a local health professional, brought a Palestinian flag to the gathering outside the Trump event.She said her message was about Palestinians, not the US election, adding that she would not vote for either of the two major candidates.“We’re here just to represent the people of Palestine. We’re not here in support of one candidate or the other,” Alamri told Al Jazeera.Wissam Charafeddine, a local activist backing the Green Party’s Stein, said the community felt humiliated by people in power and faced a “catastrophe” of retreating from the political system.“What’s happening is trauma,” he told Al Jazeera.“Every single person living in this area is affected directly somehow from this war – either by a family member or a friend being killed or by a house or property being destroyed. That’s other than the shared trauma of watching a genocide of children and women that’s being committed in front of their eyes on a daily basis.”","US election 2024: Arab Americans united in grief, divided on strategy","2025-06-28T10:02:19.735131Z"

Every television report, article and radio interview that has failed to robustly challenge Israeli claims has systematically dehumanised Palestinians,” the letter said.Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 43,259 Palestinians and wounded 101,827 since October 7, 2023. An estimated 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks that day and more than 200 were taken captive.The signatories called on the BBC to implement editorial commitments including “reiterating that Israel does not give external journalists access to Gaza; making it clear when there is insufficient evidence to back up Israeli claims; making clear where Israel is the perpetrator in article headlines; including regular historical context predating October 2023; and robustly challenging Israeli government and military representatives in all interviews”.The letter said British media organisations such as the BBC, ITV and Sky “enjoy high levels of public trust” and have a “duty to fearlessly follow the evidence”.It also noted that the BBC “is licence fee funded, and the erosion of its own editorial standards has put its impartiality and independence at serious risk”.Last November, more than a month after Israel began its war in Gaza, eight United Kingdom-based journalists employed by the BBC wrote a letter to Al Jazeera and said the BBC is guilty of a “double standard in how civilians are seen”, given that it is “unflinching” in its reporting of alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine.“This organisation doesn’t represent us,” one of the co-writers told Al Jazeera.“For me, and definitely for other people of colour, we can see blatantly that certain civilian lives are considered more worthy than others – that there is some sort of hierarchy at play.”Israel’s war has now expanded to Lebanon, where at least 2,897 people have been killed and 13,150 wounded in Israeli attacks since the war on Gaza began.The BBC has defended its coverage of the war in Gaza.According to UK media reports on Friday, a BBC spokesperson said: “When we make mistakes or have made changes to the way we report, we are transparent.“We are also very clear with our audiences on the limitations put on our reporting – including the lack of access into Gaza and restricted access to parts of Lebanon, and our continued efforts to get reporters into those areas,” the spokesperson added.","Over 100 staff accuse BBC of bias in coverage of Israel’s war in Gaza","2025-06-28T10:50:47.923356Z"

Fourteen of them were killed in a series of Israeli air strikes and shelling from warships in central Gaza’s Nuseirat refugee camp on Friday, medical officials at al-Awda Hospital said.“People are arriving to the hospital in carts pulled by animals, because it’s quite hard for civil defence and front-line emergency workers to reach the area, as Israeli military drones are actively operating there,” Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reported from Deir el-Balah as the bombs fell a few kilometres away.One of the targets in Nuseirat was a school-turned-shelter for displaced Palestinians, bringing the total number of such centres hit since the start of the war to close to 200.Abu Mohammed al-Taweel, a witness of the Israeli attacks on Nuseirat, said he saw many people killed after multiple family homes were targeted, with a five-month-old baby among the dead.“The Israelis are eager to kill Palestinian children and women. There are no resistance fighters in the camp. They hit us without any prior warning,” he told Al Jazeera.“We are here to die. We are ready to die.

Since October last year, at least 2,897 people have been killed and 13,150 wounded in Lebanon by Israeli attacks.Multiple evacuation orders were issued on Friday morning to residents of a number of neighbourhoods in the southern suburbs of the capital, Beirut. A series of massive strikes ensued, leaving behind destroyed buildings and Lebanese scrambling to open roads for ambulances to reach casualties.But emergency responders and civil defence crew are also regularly being targeted, as well. At least six medics were killed in multiple Israeli attacks taking place within three hours on Thursday, bringing the total number of paramedics killed since the beginning of the aggression to 178, with 279 wounded and 246 vehicles hit.This week, the Israeli army issued forced evacuation orders – which amount to effective kill zones – for dozens of villages and towns in southern Lebanon, along with the major ancient cities of Baalbek and Tyre.Two buildings were levelled in one of the latest Israeli raids near Imam Hussein Mosque in Tyre’s Raml neighbourhood on Friday, with paramedics struggling to pull bodies from under the rubble.“Ancient Phoenician cities steeped in history are in deep peril of being left in ruins,” Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the United Nation’s special coordinator for Lebanon, said about the threat posed by Israeli attacks for Tyre and Baalbek.Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has called the attacks on those cities and Israel’s evacuation orders “war crimes”, along with other killings and destruction, as he maintains contact with counterparts from the United States and the region to achieve a ceasefire.Even as US and Lebanese officials initially expressed hope this week that a Lebanon ceasefire could be reached, there was no sign of a breakthrough after Washington’s envoys returned home following talks in Israel.Mikati said expanding attacks “confirm the Israeli enemy’s rejection of all efforts being made to secure a ceasefire”.Israel has demanded Hezbollah’s withdrawal from Lebanon’s southern borders and its disarming, or to reserve the right to carry out attacks in Lebanon.","Israeli attacks kill dozens in Gaza, Lebanon as ceasefire remains elusive","2025-06-28T10:44:32.010874Z"

He addressed Hezbollah’s followers following Nasrallah’s assassination.He wears a white turban, unlike Nasrallah and Safieddine whose black turbans signalled descendance from the prophet.Immediately after Nasrallah’s assassination, there were two candidates to replace him: Qassem and Hashem Safieddine, who headed the executive council.Safieddine was targeted a few days after Israel assassinated Nasrallah but his death wasn’t announced for a couple of weeks, reportedly due to the fact that Israeli military strikes impeded the rescue process.Much of Hezbollah’s military leadership has been assassinated by Israel in a little over a month and its domestic political allies have started to put distance between themselves and the group.“Ultimately, he’s one of the last standing figures of the political and religious leadership cadre that was eligible to be elected secretary-general,” Blanford said. “I’m not surprised at all. It was a clear-cut decision.”“I don’t think it signals a change, if anything, Qassem is a sign of continuity [for Hezbollah].” ","What do we know about Hezbollah’s new leader, Naim Qassem?","2025-07-15T20:32:36.679494Z"

The Ministry of Health in Gaza said at least 25 children were among the dead.Israel’s military said it was “looking into the reports of the strike”, while its main ally, the United States, called the attack “horrifying”.The United Nations Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said it was “appalled” by the bombing, describing it one of the deadliest single attacks in Gaza in nearly three months. The UN’s humanitarian agency (OCHA) said the assault on the Abu Nasr family home was among seven “mass casualty incidents” in Gaza in the past week alone.Israel’s escalating air and ground assault on Beit Lahiya comes as its siege of northern Gaza has entered its 26th day.The Israeli military said it launched the offensive to stop Hamas fighters from regrouping in the north of the territory, despite saying earlier this year that it had wiped out the Palestinian group – which governs Gaza – in the area.According to the the Palestinian Civil Defence, more than 100,000 people remain trapped in the north without food and water and dozens remain buried in the rubble of bombed homes, with rescue workers unable to reach them due to Israel’s ongoing siege and attacks.Footage from the Israeli assault on the Abu Nasr family home early on Tuesday, obtained by Al Jazeera, showed a Palestinian man covered in dust trapped under concrete and steel bars as others tried to break apart walls using pick axes to free him. Outside the building, several bodies wrapped in blankets lay on the ground.Ismail Ouaida, a witness, said the Israeli attack came without warning.“As you can see, there are martyrs all over the place,” he said, pointing to two dead bodies under the rubble. “[There are] bodies hanging over the walls.”Another Palestinian woman, in footage verified by Al Jazeera, said she lost multiple members of her family.“Both my sons with their entire families were killed.

What did those innocent people do to be slaughtered like this?”Rabie al-Shandagly, a 30-year-old survivor, told the AFP news agency that most of the victims were women and children.“The explosion happened at night and I first thought it was shelling, but when I went out after sunrise, I saw people pulling bodies, limbs and the wounded from under the rubble,” he said. “People are trying to save the injured, but there are no hospitals or proper medical care.”At the Kamal Adwan Hospital, the main medical facility serving the people of north Gaza, dozens of wounded people arrived seeking treatment, but the hospital’s director said there were no staff to treat the patients as Israeli forces had arrested most of its workers in a raid last week.“The Kamal Adwan Hospital and the entire vicinity is a war zone. The hospital is left with no resources; no medical supplies; no medical staff. This is because many of our specialised doctors and surgeons have been detained,” Dr Hussam Abu Safiya said.He described chaotic scenes with patients and the injured “strewn all over” the hospital floor, and called for urgent international intervention.In Washington, DC, a spokesman for the US State Department expressed concern.“This was a horrifying incident with a horrifying result,” Matthew Miller told reporters. “We have reached out to the government of Israel to ask what happened here.”In Geneva, a spokesman for UN’s OHCHR called for a prompt, transparent and detailed investigation.“It is imperative for Israel to allow emergency rescue services access to such sites in North Gaza. In some cases, rescue workers themselves have been attacked while trying to reach the injured,” Jeremy Laurence said.The UN’s Middle East peace envoy also condemned the attack.“This horrific strike is yet another in a deadly series of recent mass casualty incidents, alongside a massive displacement campaign, in the north of Gaza that raises serious concerns about violations of international humanitarian law,” Tor Wennesland said in a statement.“I unequivocally condemn the widespread killing and injury of civilians in Gaza, and the endless displacement of the population in Gaza.”Israel’s yearlong war has so far killed at least 43,061 Palestinians in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to Palestinian officials.","Israel again bombs Gaza’s Beit Lahiya hours after killing 93 in one strike","2025-06-24T20:14:41.082907Z"

Some people shouted “Shame on you” and made a commotion, forcing Netanyahu to stop his speech shortly after it began.One of the protesters repeatedly shouted, “My father was killed.”According to a Times of Israel report, the commemoration was initially not meant to include speeches by bereaved family members, fearing they would criticise the Israeli government. But amid protests, the family members were allowed to deliver their speeches at the ceremony.An estimated 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks on October 7 last year, and more than 200 were taken captive. Nearly 100 captives remain in Gaza.Public and diplomatic pressure has been mounting on Netanyahu’s administration to do more to strike a deal for securing the release of captives still held in Gaza.Meanwhile, Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Sunday proposed a two-day truce in Gaza to allow the exchange of four Israeli captives for some Palestinian prisoners.El-Sisi made the announcement as efforts to end the devastating, more than yearlong war on Gaza resumed in the Qatari capital, Doha, with the directors of the CIA and Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency taking part.Speaking alongside Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune during a news conference in Cairo, el-Sisi also said talks should resume within 10 days of implementing the truce in efforts to reach a permanent ceasefire.Families of the remaining captives, along with several Western leaders, have called on the Israeli government to broker an agreement after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar earlier this month.Reporting from Doha, Al Jazeera’s Osama bin Javaid said Sinwar’s death has provided a new opportunity for ceasefire talks, but in reality, both “sides are digging their heels”.“Hamas says removal of the leadership does not take away what they’ve been fighting for, which in their words they say is ‘illegal occupation’,” he said.Meanwhile, critics in Israel have accused Netanyahu of obstructing mediation for a truce and deal to release the 97 captives still held by armed groups in Gaza. The Israeli military says 34 of them are dead.Netanyahu has rejected ceasefire proposals, including one from the Biden administration in May, and approved the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader then engaged in negotiations, in Tehran. Hamas has been seeking an end to the war and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, which has been ravaged by more than a year of nonstop Israeli bombardment. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 7, 2023.The Israeli far-right administration has pushed for a military solution, as it has opened a new front after it launched a ground offensive in southern Lebanon against the armed group Hezbollah.In a separate speech on Sunday, marking the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the Hamas attack, which on October 7 last triggered the ongoing war on Gaza, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said military action by itself will not achieve the country’s war aims, which include bringing home the captives.“Not all objectives can be achieved through military operations alone … To realise our moral duty to bring our hostages home, we will have to make painful concessions,” Gallant said.","Israeli protesters interrupt Netanyahu’s speech as Gaza truce talks resume","2025-07-15T20:33:01.195335Z"

Police cordoned off the area and a security helicopter hovered above.Police did not immediately say whether it was a deliberate attack.“At 10:08 am [08:08 GMT], a report was received … of a truck hitting a bus stop on Aharon Yariv Boulevard in Ramat Hasharon …  Paramedics are currently providing medical treatment on site to dozens of casualties,” the Magen David Adom emergency service said in a statement.One of those hurt died later of his injuries, said the hospital where he was taken for treatment.The Jerusalem Post news website quoted police as saying civilians who were on the scene had shot at the truck driver to stop him.Paramedic Elior Yosef, who arrived at the bus stop after the ramming, said he saw eight people “trapped under the truck”.“A number of further casualties were either lying or walking near the truck,” he was quoted as saying in the Magen David Adom statement.The Palestinian group Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, said in a statement that the “heroic ramming attack” that was carried out near “Mossad headquarters … was in response to the crimes committed by the Zionist occupation” against Palestinians.Abed Abou Shhade, a journalist from Jaffa in Israel, told Al Jazeera the truck driver is believed to be a Palestinian citizen from northern Tel Aviv.“The civilians who witnessed the incident killed the driver as soon as they saw who he was,” he said.“The police initially framed it as a terror attack. But now they have changed their line, saying the matter is still under investigation,” he added. “Everything is under speculation.”Abou Shhade said due to the increasing tensions in Israel, suspects in such attacks are automatically labelled “terrorists” if the incident involves people of Arab background, even in cases where the circumstances are not clear.The incident came as Israel marks the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack that was followed by Israel’s genocide in Gaza and the war on Lebanon.Elsewhere, a man who tried to stab a group of Israeli soldiers was killed in Hizma, a Palestinian town near Jerusalem.“A terrorist accelerated with his vehicle toward [Israeli army] soldiers who were conducting counterterrorism activity adjacent to the area of Hizma,” the military said in a statement, without identifying the attacker.“The terrorist pulled out a knife from his vehicle, and attempted to carry out a stabbing attack. The soldiers eliminated the terrorist and thwarted the attempted terror attack,” it said, adding that no soldiers were hurt.","One killed, dozens wounded after truck hits bus stop in Israel’s Tel Aviv","2025-07-15T20:45:47.868498Z"

Later, it was reported that 14 of those detained, including the hospital’s director Hussam Abu Safia, were released.“A critical shortage of medical supplies, compounded by severely limited access, are depriving people of life-saving care,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief, posted on X on Saturday.Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza said that the Israeli forces caused widespread damage to the pharmaceutical warehouse and the ICU.“Everyone knows that Kamal Adwan Hospital is considered a medical lifeline for the two-thirds of Palestinians in northern Gaza.”Outside the hospital, hundreds of spent bullet cartridges littered the floor. Footage shared by the Health Ministry revealed damage to buildings and vandalised wards.Nurse Mayssoun Alian said Israeli forces surrounded the hospital in the morning “and there was shooting from all directions.“They evacuated all those who were sheltering here. They separated the men from women and made two queues. It was very humiliating for our men since they were stripped of their clothes,” she told Al Jazeera.There was chaos inside the hospital with patients lying on the floor, including in the hallways, according to footage accessed by Al Jazeera.A patient and witness in the hospital told Al Jazeera that Israeli forces first shelled the courtyard at about 5am (03:00 GMT) on Friday.“Thirty minutes later, bulldozers destroyed everything, including the tents housing the displaced,” he said. “They destroyed the hospital’s pharmacy and riddled the hospital with bullets. They started calling for Dr Hussam over the loudspeakers.”At least two children died inside the intensive care unit when Israeli forces destroyed the generators and oxygen station on Friday, medics said.Kamal Adwan Hospital spokesperson Hisham Sakani told Al Jazeera that the latest assault marks the 14th time that the hospital has come under Israeli fire.Israel has repeatedly attacked hospitals since it launched the devastating war on October 7, 2023. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces and large parts of Gaza lay in ruins. At least 17 out of 35 hospitals across the Strip are partially functioning.On Friday, the UN special rapporteur on health used a new term – medicide – to describe the widespread and systematic attacks by Israel on healthcare workers and facilities.Gaza’s Health Ministry stated that all detained medical personnel were held by the Israeli military without access to food or water. According to the ministry, three nurses were injured, and three ambulances were destroyed.Among those taken was Mohamed Obeid, head of the orthopaedics department at Al-Awda Hospital nearby, though his current location remains unknown, according to the hospital.Footage shared on social media on Saturday showed hospital director Abu Safia, mourning the loss of his minor son, who was killed during the two-day Israeli assault.An Israeli military spokesperson declined to comment on the report. On Friday, the Israeli military stated it had conducted operations near the hospital based on intelligence indicating the presence of “terrorists and terrorist infrastructure” in the area.A spokesperson from the UN agency for children said northern Gaza is a disaster zone after the Israeli military’s three-week ground incursion.“Attacks have been escalating, hospitals and schools used as shelters haven’t been spared,” UNICEF’s Rosalia Bollen told Al Jazeera.“It’s been extremely difficult to bring supplies to the north with only 224 trucks reaching.

There’s no fuel, no electricity.”The Health Ministry reported that Israeli military strikes on Jabalia, Beit Hanoon, and Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza have killed approximately 800 people over the course of a three-week offensive.","Israeli forces detain medics, patients after violent raid on Gaza hospital","2025-06-28T10:56:36.265435Z"

There was no warning before the strike, which destroyed several buildings and left cars marked “press” covered in rubble.“This is an assassination, after monitoring and tracking, with premeditation and planning, as there were 18 journalists present at the location representing seven media institutions,” Lebanon’s Information Minister Ziad Makary wrote on social media.The killings add to one of the deadliest records for journalists covering a conflict in years.At least 128 journalists and media workers are among the tens of thousands of people Israel has killed in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon over the past year — the deadliest time for journalists since the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) began to track the killings more than four decades ago.According to Palestinian officials, the death toll is even higher with 176 journalists killed in Gaza alone.“CPJ is deeply outraged by yet another deadly Israeli airstrike on journalists, this time hitting a compound hosting 18 members of the press in south Lebanon,” CPJ Programme Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna said in a statement to Al Jazeera.“Deliberately targeting journalists is a war crime under international law. This attack must be independently investigated and the perpetrators must be held to account.”Israeli officials have regularly smeared the journalists slain in Gaza, accusing them without evidence of being members of Hamas and other groups.This week, Israel accused six Al Jazeera journalists of being Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad “operatives” — sparking fear that it may be pre-emptively justifying their targeting. Al Jazeera categorically rejected the Israeli allegations.Israel has killed several Al Jazeera journalists and their family members in Gaza since the war began, including the network’s correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Samer Abudaqa.Critics accuse Israel – which banned foreign reporters from entering Gaza – targets journalists in the Palestinian territory to obscure the truth about its war crimes there.CPJ has repeatedly documented Israel’s “pattern of smearing of Palestinian journalists with unsubstantiated ‘terrorist’ labels following their killings”.The latest threat against Al Jazeera journalists comes as calls have mounted for Israel to allow foreign journalists into Gaza. Earlier this year, more than 70 media and civil society organisations signed an open letter calling on Israel to grant journalists access, a demand recently echoed by dozens of US lawmakers.Diana Buttu, a Palestinian lawyer and analyst, said Israel does not want the world to see what is happening in Gaza.“On the one hand, they’re not allowing international journalists, and on the other hand, they’re assassinating those journalists who are there,” Buttu told Al Jazeera. “And then, they’re smearing those journalists who are there and somehow labelling them as targets.”Buttu stressed that, under international law, people can only be considered legitimate targets in war if they are combatants who engage in fighting – accusing someone of being affiliated with an armed group, whether true or not, does not make them a legitimate target.She added that Israel is “turning international law on its head” by labelling people as members of Hezbollah and Hamas to justify their killing.Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based rights group DAWN said Israel’s accusations against Al Jazeera’s journalists is a “deliberate tactic to intimidate and silence those exposing its ongoing ethnic cleansing and forced displacement in northern Gaza”.“This campaign against journalists reporting on the atrocities only further proves Israel’s desperation to cover up its war crimes and systematic genocide against Palestinians,” Jarrar added.While Israel has targeted journalists at an unprecedented rate during the ongoing war, it killed dozens more in the years preceding it. But there was no consequence for those killings and this impunity has paved the way for the current escalation, analysts say.Zaha Hassan, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Al Jazeera that “the deadliest place to work these days for journalists is where Israel is waging war.”The think tank published a video earlier this year, documenting the lives of Palestinian journalists in Gaza. Just before its release, one of the journalists it features, Sami Shehadeh, lost a leg in an Israeli attack on the Nuseirat refugee camp, where he was filming.Hassan said the lack of accountability for the killing of Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh – who was a US citizen – by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank in 2022 was a “harbinger of things to come”.For months after Abu Akleh’s killing, US legislators and advocates called for an independent US investigation into the incident.While US and Israeli media outlets have reported that the US Department of Justice opened a probe into the shooting, American officials never publicly confirmed it, and any findings have not been released. No one has been punished for killing Abu Akleh.“If justice could be denied to Shireen by her own government, how can we expect justice for Palestinian journalists in Gaza or any other journalists working in the killing fields of Palestine and Lebanon?” said Hassan.“The US State Department and the White House recognise the critically important role journalists play in truth-telling. Unfortunately, they don’t put the same emphasis or value on truth or civil life when the truth is exposing Israeli war crimes or the civilian target is a Palestinian or Arab journalist.”The US often stresses the so-called “rules-based order” when criticising policies by Russia and China, but has maintained its unconditional support for Israel despite well-documented abuses, including the killing of journalists.Washington provides at least $3.8bn in military aid to Israel annually, and President Joe Biden has approved an additional $14bn in assistance to the US ally to help fund the current war.While the US and other countries have failed to curb Israel’s attacks on journalists, advocates have also criticised the world’s mainstream media for inadequate attention and anger over Israeli attacks against the press.“There are a lot of people who are complicit in this. It’s not just the governments, which are definitely complicit, but it’s also the fact that we haven’t heard international outrage from other journalists,” said Buttu, a close friend of Abu Akleh.“These Palestinian journalists, these Lebanese journalists, their lives are no less worthy than those of international journalists, and the fact that we haven’t seen any sort of outrage is incredible.”But some alternative media outlets have been outspoken in condemning the attacks against journalists by Israel.This week, the US-based progressive publication Jewish Currents issued a statement in support of the six Al Jazeera journalists targeted by Israel.“As a journalistic institution, we generally refrain from putting out statements or calling on others to take action, but our position as media workers compels us to stand in solidarity with our colleagues in Gaza,” it said.“The normalization of Israel’s flagrant targeting of journalists has implications for reporters around the world.”The publication added that the targeting of Palestinian journalists “should be treated as a crisis for the international media”.","How impunity fuels Israel’s attacks on journalists in Gaza and Lebanon","2025-07-14T21:42:50.668809Z"

I have spoken to colleagues who are beside themselves, trying to do whatever they can with the limited supplies they have in the Gaza Strip.“The needs are as vast yet as simple as they ever have been: families need food, water, medicine and shelter. Any further prevention of access to these basic supplies will worsen what is already a catastrophic and completely man-made humanitarian disaster,” she said.The current conflict between Israel and the views of the international community does not exist in isolation but is the latest in a string of confrontations Israel has had with the UN.On Tuesday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied on its Hebrew X account the historical fact of the UN’s role in Israel’s establishment, claiming that Israel was founded solely through “victory…in the War of Independence”, which is what Israel calls the conflict that resulted in the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their homes in 1948.Translation: “Prime Minister’s Office: A reminder to the president of France: It was not the UN resolution that established the State of Israel, but rather the victory achieved in the War of Independence with the blood of heroic fighters, many of whom were Holocaust survivors – including from the Vichy regime in France.”The English-language account did not carry a similar post.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has been barred from entering Israel over what the government says is his failure to “fully condemn” a missile strike by Iran on Israel in October.“The UN matters to people in Israel. That the country was founded by UN charter [in 1948] is part of the collective memory,” analyst Nimrod Flaschenberg said from Tel Aviv.“However, we’ve been seeing a gradual process of delegitimisation of the UN throughout the last few decades, when it has been portrayed as a bastion of anti-Israel or even anti-Semitic sentiment by Israel’s leaders.”Ironically, one of the leading critics of the UN is Netanyahu, himself Israel’s former ambassador to the body from 1984 to 1988.Under his right-wing Likud party – in power since 2009 – and more recently during its alliance with Israeli extreme-right and ultra-Orthodox factions, confrontations have grown with the UN and, with them, the international body’s legitimacy challenged in the eyes of many.“The UN often makes it easy for its critics,” Flaschenberg cautioned. “Guterres [the former secretary-general of Portugal’s Socialist Party] is a problem for many,” he said, describing the distrust of left-wing and liberal thought among Israel’s growing right wing.Flaschenberg explained that “the UN Human Rights Council’s ‘obsession’ with Israel/Palestine is undeniable. The fact that a disproportionate amount of time is dedicated to us, makes it easy for Israeli critics of the UN to call it anti-Semitic.”Contacted by Al Jazeera, a spokesperson for the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said, “The mandate of the high commissioner is to promote – universally and specifically with member states – the respect and protection of human rights in accordance with applicable international law and standards.”Referring to High Commissioner Volker Turk, the spokesperson continued: “The high commissioner carries out his mandate impartially irrespective of by whom, when or where abuses and violations of international human rights law are committed.“All actions of the Office are based on facts obtained through a rigorous monitoring and reporting methodology and assessed in accordance with relevant international legal standards (International Human Rights Law and International humanitarian law),” he added.Earlier this year, the international community’s report on Israel’s action in Gaza, Anatomy of a Genocide, which contained numerous documented instances of rights abuses, was dismissed as biased or anti-Semitic by both Israel and its close military and diplomatic ally, the United States.The US has also led condemnation of the UN’s open-ended Commission of Inquiry (COI) into the frequent accusations against Israel for its breaches of international human rights law in its treatment of the Palestinians under its control.The same year, UN Watch, an NGO described by the AFP news agency as “a lobby group with strong ties to Israel”, claimed that the UN General Assembly (UNGA) had adopted 15 resolutions against Israel, compared with seven against the rest of the world.Two of the UN’s 2023 resolutions concerned Israel’s actions in Gaza of that year, where more than 20,000 people had been killed.Other resolutions reinforced previous rulings, such as those condemning Israel’s settlements in the occupied West Bank, or the construction of its security barrier, condemned as an apartheid measure by numerous rights groups.Still others included the environmental damage Israel was charged with carrying out in the Palestinian territory it occupies, as well as in Lebanon.“Israel was both created by and early on was in violation of much of international law,” Paul Salem of the Middle East Institute said. “There’s a built-in conflict.”Almost immediately after Israel was created by UN mandate came the Nakba, the ethnic cleansing of more than 700,000 Palestinians, who to this day are refugees, barred from returning, many living in refugee camps in the occupied West Bank or neighbouring countries.Likewise, the occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, which Israel has maintained since 1967, puts it on the wrong side of the fourth Geneva Convention and demonstrates its disregard for UN edicts and international law, seen as inviolable the world over.Some areas of dispute between the UN and Israel are more recent. Principally, the bills banning UNRWA from the Palestinian territories where it is most needed and the ongoing attacks on UN forces operating to enforce a resolution that Israel had been party to.However, as Israel extends its war in Gaza northwards, its invading forces in Lebanon have come up against the UN forces operating there under international mandate.“UNIFIL is in the way. They want them out of the way but this is not a legitimate or legal way to do it,” Salem said, pointing to diplomatic and legal restraints that protect UN peacekeepers.“Perhaps Israel should withdraw from the UN and no longer claim that it wants to resolve things through diplomacy.“Diplomacy is frustrating, I get it. It doesn’t always work, but that’s why the UN was created, so that things are not resolved by military force,” he said.That the UN has changed since Israel’s creation is a fact.The 51 member states in the UN that gave birth to Israel have grown to a General Assembly (UNGA) of 193 as countries gained their independence from colonisers.In the UNGA, most of the world’s countries view the Palestinian cause as important.Likewise, recently Israel has diverged even more dramatically from other members of the GA.“I am pessimistic about Israel’s future as a liberal democratic state,” Richard Caplan of Oxford University said.“At the moment, Israel is in survival mode, responding to immediate threats with blatant disregard for international humanitarian law, notwithstanding its repeated assertions that it operates the ‘most moral armed forces’ in the world.”Even during a relatively optimistic period, with the Israeli economy strong after the COVID pandemic and relations between Israel and some Arab states warming, Caplan noted, Israel chose not to seek a political settlement to its conflict with Palestine and, by extension, help heal the rift with the UN.“To the contrary, the brutal colonisation of the Occupied Territories continued unabated, with Netanyahu pledging to prevent the emergence of a Palestinian state,” Caplan wrote by email.“While there may be broad opposition to Netanyahu among Israelis, by and large Israelis tolerate, if not support, the occupation.“Who are the members of the Knesset who have been elected on a platform to end the occupation? The only hope may be if Israel’s allies work earnestly towards establishing a Palestinian state and use their leverage … to pressure Israel to alter its behaviour.” he wrote.“Otherwise I fear the future will bring more deracination, more ethnic cleansing, more violence.”","Israel’s ‘war’ against the UN","2025-06-24T20:34:04.668932Z"

It is also full of hundreds of people seeking shelter”.The Palestinian health ministry said Israeli forces “stormed” the hospital, “detaining hundreds of patients, medical staff and some displaced individuals from neighbouring areas who sought refuge”.Reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said witnesses and doctors at the scene said fires had broken out, making it difficult for people to evacuate the building and for ambulances to operate.Wounded patients and those with other health complications were dragged outside the buildings into the courtyard of the hospital, Mahmoud reported.“This is happening at a time when fuel was expected to reach the hospital to sustain the power generators,” Mahmoud said. “It’s hard to imagine that the hospital will be able to sustain its operations now as it comes under direct attack by the Israeli military.”He said there was a heavy military presence in the area, with dozens of Israeli tanks surrounding the medical compound.The Israeli military said only that it was “operating in the area” of the hospital based on intelligence that indicated the presence of “terrorists and terrorist infrastructure”.A second medical facility in northern Gaza, the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahiya, was put out of service on Monday as Israeli soldiers stormed a school and detained the men there before setting the facility ablaze. The fire reached the hospital generators, causing a power outage.Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud said the solar panels on the rooftop were also damaged, “leaving the Indonesian Hospital without any source of power”, including for lifelines such as incubators.Those evacuated from the Indonesian Hospital were displaced to Kamal Adwan Hospital, a mid-size facility struggling to accommodate patients beyond capacity.The United Nations said it had been unable to reach all three hospitals in northern Gaza – Kamal Adwan, Indonesian and al-Awda Hospital – despite demanding access to allow aid in.The UN Human Rights Office said it was “increasingly concerned that the manner in which the Israeli military is conducting hostilities” in northern Gaza, also with the “unlawful interference with humanitarian assistance and orders that are leading to forced displacement”.","Patients, staff trapped in Gaza’s Kamal Adwan Hospital amid Israeli siege","2025-06-28T10:42:50.473528Z"

The numbers are terrifying,” the official told Al Jazeera.At least one person has been killed and several others were wounded in the strike at the entrance of the laboratory of Kamal Adwan Hospital, Gaza’s Health Ministry said.The Palestinian news agency Wafa also reported that because of the military siege, two intensive care unit patients at the Indonesian Hospital have died on Saturday.In another Israeli attack on central Gaza’s Maghazi refugee camp, at least 16 people were killed, the Palestinian official news agency WAFA said on Saturday, adding that there are still missing people under the rubble.At least seven people were also reported killed in a separate Israeli strike on a school sheltering Palestinian refugees in al-Shati camp, just west of Jabalia. In Jabalia itself, an air strike on Saturday afternoon killed five more people.Another four people were reported killed in another Israeli strike in al-Nuseirat refugee camp, according to our Al Jazeera team from Gaza.In Rafah city, southern Gaza Strip, two people were killed in an Israeli drone airstrike on the Khirbet area.In all, the death toll has surpassed the 67 killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza in the last 24 hours, as earlier reported by health authorities in the enclave. At least 450 have been killed since the siege began two weeks ago.Al Jazeera’s Tarek Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said witnesses in northern Gaza told him the second and third floors of the Indonesian Hospital, as well as its courtyard, have been hit, resulting in “a number of casualties”.At least 40 patients are trapped inside the hospital and Israeli tanks have surrounded it, he said.Meanwhile, the attack on al-Awda Hospital cut power to the medical facility. Witnesses also told Abu Azzoum the situation in other parts of Jabalia had “severely deteriorated” since Friday.“They said that they are surrounded by Israeli tanks and that destruction is everywhere. They said that the smell of death is in every corner of the Jabalia refugee camp,” he added.“We have to remember that Jabalia is already under a crippling siege with no food and water entering the area for the 15th day now,” Abu Azzoum said.Communications and internet services had also been completely been cut off, disrupting rescue operations, he said, adding that Israeli forces have been advancing further into the centre of Jabalia and fighting with Hamas forces.Meanwhile, Palestinian authorities warned the death toll from the latest strikes on Jabalia could rise, as some people were believed to be still trapped under the rubble.The Palestinian official news agency, Wafa, said children were among the 33 confirmed dead. At least 85 others were wounded, some critically, raising fears of more fatalities.The Israeli military said its operation in Jabalia is intended to stop Hamas fighters regrouping for more attacks. But the Health Ministry in Gaza said most of the people killed were civilians.On Friday, health officials appealed for fuel, medical supplies and food to be sent immediately to the three northern Gaza hospitals which have been overwhelmed by the number of patients and injuries.The World Health Organization (WHO) has also accused Israel of preventing at least 50 medical specialists belonging to eight groups from entering Gaza, the first such case of entire organisations being blocked from participating in humanitarian efforts in the besieged territory.Northern Gaza, once home to more than half of the territory’s 2.3 million people, was bombed to rubble in the first phase of Israel’s assault a year ago. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s genocide on Gaza so far, according to Gaza’s health authorities.","Hospitals in northern Gaza under Israeli fire as Jabalia attack kills 33","2025-07-15T20:37:29.072677Z"

It has also witnessed several ground assaults since Israel launched its war on Gaza in October last year.Residents in Jabalia and nearby towns said cuts in communications and internet services disrupted rescue operations by ambulance teams and the ability of people affected by Israeli attacks to seek help.Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from central Gaza’s Deir el-Balah, said confrontations in Jabalia are “raging”.The camp “has been denied access to essentials – medical and humanitarian supplies – by the Israeli army,” Azzoum said.He quoted witnesses as saying the camp is undergoing “a genocide”. “Families have been getting killed inside their homes in Jabalia. … The vast majority of hospitals there are overwhelmed with casualties.”The United Nations estimated 400,000 people are trapped in northern Gaza and have been unable to leave due to intense bombardments, Israeli snipers and ground troops.Since the latest incursion, northern Gaza has been sealed off. Israeli troops have allowed in no food, drink or medicine. Local officials said people are starving.Also on Friday, health officials appealed for fuel, medical supplies and food to be sent immediately to three northern Gaza hospitals overwhelmed by the number of patients and injuries.At the Kamal Adwan Hospital, medics had to replace children in intensive care with more critical cases of adults badly wounded by Israeli air strikes on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians in Jabalia.That attack on Thursday killed 28 people. Israel said it had targeted fighters holed up in the complex – something that Hamas vehemently denied.Kamal Adwan’s director, Hussam Abu Safiya, said in a video sent to the media that the children had been moved to another division inside the facility, where they were being well taken care of.Doctors at Kamal Adwan as well as the al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals have repeatedly called for a humanitarian corridor and refused to leave their patients despite evacuation orders issued by the Israeli army.Abu Safiya said medical staff were exhausted and hospital supplies, including food, were badly depleted.Health officials said more than 450 people have been killed in the Israeli assault in northern Gaza over the past two weeks.At least 42,500 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s ongoing offensive so far.","At least 39 killed across Gaza as Israeli army escalates assault in north","2025-06-28T10:57:23.494907Z"

That obstacle no longer exists. But much work remains before us,” Biden said in a statement.He added that he would “congratulate” the Israeli leaders and “discuss the pathway for bringing the hostages home to their families and for ending this war once and for all, which has caused so much devastation to innocent people.”Vice President Kamala Harris hailed Sinwar’s death and said it was a chance to “finally end the war in Gaza.”“Justice has been served,” she told reporters. “Sinwar was responsible for the killing of thousands of innocent people, including the victims of October 7 and hostages killed in Gaza.“Today I can only hope that the families of the victims of Hamas feel a sense and measure of relief,” she added.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said that the death of Sinwar would make prospects of peace in Gaza easier, adding that he planned to meet with Netanyahu soon.The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is an umbrella organisation comprising several political parties that claim to represent Palestinians worldwide. It expressed its condolences on the death of Sinwar, accused Israel of committing “massacres and genocide” against Palestinians and called for all Palestinian factions to stand united.In a separate statement, Fatah, a secular political party founded by diaspora Palestinians after the 1948 Nakba, said Israel’s policy of “killing and terrorism will not succeed in breaking the will of our people to achieve their legitimate national rights to freedom and independence”.Khalil Hayya, the head of Hamas in Gaza, described Sinwar as “steadfast, brave and intrepid,” adding that he “sacrificed his life to the cause of our liberation.”“He met his end standing brave, with his head held high, holding his firearm, firing until the last breath, until the last moment of his life.“[Sinwar] has lived his whole life as a holy fighter. Since his early days, he was engaged in his struggle as a resistant fighter. He stood defiant behind Israeli bars, and after his release in a swap deal, he continued with his struggle and his dedication to the cause,” Hayya said.Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, issued a statement mourning Sinwar, saying he “ascended facing the enemy, not retreating.”“The criminal enemy is delusional if he thinks that by assassinating the great leaders of the resistance such as Sinwar, Haniyeh, Nasrallah, al-Arouri and others, he can extinguish the flame of the resistance or force it to retreat. Rather, it will continue and escalate until the legitimate goals of our people are achieved,” it said.“The news of the assassination and martyrdom of … Mr Yahya Sanwar, was painful for the world’s freedom seekers, especially the heroic people of Palestine and a clear sign of the unstoppable crimes of the child-killing Zionist occupier regime,” said President Masoud Pezeshkian.Iran’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas Araghchi said Sinwar “did not fear death but sought martyrdom in Gaza.”“He bravely fought to the very end on the battlefield,” he wrote on X.In an apparent reference to a video that portrayed him throwing a stick at an Israeli drone before being killed, Araghchi said “his fate – beautifully pictured in his last image – is not a deterrent but a source of inspiration for resistance fighters across the region, Palestinian and non-Palestinian.”“We, and countless others around the world, salute his selfless struggle for [the] liberation of the Palestinian people,” he continued. “Martyrs live forever, and the cause for liberation of Palestine from occupation is more alive than ever.”Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis said they mourned the Hamas leader.“My sincere condolences and great blessings to the Hamas movement and the dear Palestinian people for the great leader Yahya Sinwar receiving the medal of martyrdom,” a spokesman for the group wrote on X, adding that “Gaza and the Palestinian cause are destined for victory, no matter how great the sacrifices.”The Lebanese group, at war with Israel, said it also mourned Sinwar and vowed to continue “support for our Palestinian people.”In a statement, the group said Sinwar had won all the “medals of honour and dignity” in his life of struggle against Israel and praised him for leading “one of the most humiliating operations in the history of the Israeli occupiers,” referring to the October 7 attack.“He won the badge of martyrdom as he loved and wished – in the battlefields of struggle, clashing face to face with occupation soldiers to the last breath.“The martyrdom of the commander [Sinwar] and those who came before him in the axis of resistance will strengthen the resolve and determination of the resistance in all the battlefields and arenas to proceed on the road of liberating Palestine and eradicating the cancerous Zionist tumour,” Hezbollah’s statement added.Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan held talks with Hamas political bureau members on Friday, expressing his condolences for “the martyrdom” of Sinwar.Fidan’s ministry said he also discussed the humanitarian situation in Gaza, underlining that Turkey “will use all diplomatic means to mobilise the international community against the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.”Josep Borrell, the 27-nation bloc’s foreign policy chief, described Sinwar as “an obstacle to an urgently needed ceasefire and the unconditional release of all hostages.”“Yahya Sinwar was a terrorist, listed by the EU, responsible for the heinous 7/10 attack,” he wrote on X.“There must be an end to violence, [the] liberation of hostages [and a] stop to the suffering of Palestinians.”Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he hoped Sinwar’s death would pave the way for a ceasefire.“With the death of the Hamas leader Sinwar … hopefully the concrete prospect will now open up for a ceasefire and an agreement to release the hostages in Gaza,” Scholz said pm Friday during a visit by US President Joe Biden.Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, in a statement, branded Sinwar “a cruel murderer and a terrorist.”She said Hamas should “immediately release all the hostages” and “lay down its arms.”President Emmanuel Macron said Sinwar “was the main person responsible for the terrorist attacks and barbaric acts of October 7.”“France demands the release of all hostages still held by Hamas,” Macron posted on X.Secretary-General Mark Rutte told reporters at a Brussels news conference that “if he has died, I personally will not miss him,” referring to Sinwar.Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said “with the death of Yahya Sinwar, the person principally responsible for the October 7 attacks no longer exists.”“I am convinced that a new phase should be launched: it is time for all the hostages to be released, for a ceasefire to be immediately proclaimed and for the reconstruction of Gaza to begin.”Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the United Kingdom “will not mourn” the death of Sinwar.Starmer condemned the mastermind of the October 7 attacks and said his thoughts were with the families of the victims.“The release of all hostages, an immediate ceasefire and an increase in humanitarian aid are long overdue so we can move towards a long-term, sustainable peace in the Middle East,” he added.Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Russia had “serious concerns” about the consequences Israel’s elimination of Sinwar would have for the Middle East, according to Russian state news agency TASS.“The main thing for us is the consequences for the peaceful population,” said Peskov, who also expressed concern about the “humanitarian disaster” in Gaza and Lebanon.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Sinwar a “brutal leader.”“Under Sinwar’s leadership, Hamas carried out the horrific atrocities of October 7, sought to destroy Israel, and launched senseless, devastating terror attacks on civilians across the region. Today delivers a measure of justice for his victims and their families. Sinwar’s death ends a reign of terror,” he said.","World reactions after Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar killed in Gaza","2025-07-15T20:36:37.472668Z"

There is nothing. This is a massacre,” Abbas said. “Civilians and children are being killed, burned under fire.”The Israeli military, without substantial evidence, said the strike targeted fighters from Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad groups. It claimed the fighters operated from within the Abu Hussein School in Jabalia that had been serving as a shelter for displaced people.Hamas strongly denied the claim that it was using the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA)-run school for fighting purposes and said in a statement that the allegations were “nothing but lies”, adding this was “a systematic policy of the enemy to justify its crime”.Earlier on Thursday, Palestinian health officials said at least 11 Palestinians were killed in two separate Israeli strikes in Gaza City, while several others were killed in central and southern Gaza areas.Footage circulated by Palestinian media of the Abu Hussein School showed smoke coming from tents that caught fire, as many displaced people evacuated casualties, including children, to ambulances.Residents of Jabalia said Israeli forces blew up clusters of houses by firing from the air, from tanks, and by placing bombs in buildings and detonating them remotely.The area has been a focus for the Israeli military for the past two weeks. The UN estimates that some 400,000 people are trapped in northern Gaza and have been unable to leave due to intense bombardment, Israeli snipers, and ground troops.Since the latest incursion, northern Gaza, including Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoon, has been completely sealed off. Israeli troops have cut off the region allowing in no food, drink, or medicine. Local officials say people are starving.Doctors at the Kamal Adwan, al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals have called for a humanitarian corridor and have refused to leave their patients despite evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military.Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from central Gaza’s Deir el-Balah, said the scene at the Kamal Adwan Hospital following the latest attack is “horrific”.“The casualties were picked up on carts pulled by animals or civilian vehicles at the bomb site, arrived at Kamal Adwan Hospital, and are on the floor of the emergency department,” Mahmoud said.“The scene is horrific. They can’t keep up with the large influx of casualties coming to the hospital.”Thursday’s attack was the latest in a string of Israeli strikes on school buildings housing displaced Palestinians in Gaza.The attacks have predominantly killed children and women. Many of the schools run by UNRWA have also been damaged or destroyed.Calls for evacuation have meanwhile fueled fears among Palestinians that the drive is aimed at clearing them from northern Gaza permanently.“We have written our death notes, and we are not leaving Jabalia,” one resident told Reuters news agency.“The occupation is punishing us for not leaving our houses in the early days of the war, and we are not going now either. They are blowing up houses, and roads, and are starving us but we die once and we don’t lose our pride,” the father of four said, refusing to give his name, fearing reprisal.Northern Gaza, which had been home to more than half of the territory’s 2.3 million people, was reduced to rubble by bombing in the first phase of Israel’s assault on the territory a year ago.More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s ongoing offensive so far, according to health officials.The United States has told Israel that it must take steps to improve the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza in 30 days or face potential restrictions on military aid.The UN has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza and distributing it throughout the war zone, blaming impediments on Israel and lawlessness. The UN said no food aid had entered northern Gaza between October 2 and October 15.On Wednesday, the Israeli military unit that oversees aid and commercial shipments said 50 trucks had entered northern Gaza.Ismail al-Thawabta, the Director-general of the Government Media Office in the Gaza strip, said Israeli comments about allowing aid into the enclave were misleading.He said the Israeli military has maintained a comprehensive siege on the far north of Gaza for 170 consecutive days, closing all humanitarian access points. He said 342 people had been killed in the Israeli assault over the last 10 days.","Israeli strike on school sheltering displaced families in Jabalia kills 28","2025-07-15T20:38:45.737080Z"

In an expletive-laden video, he said “the university has decided to not allow me to be on campus anymore. My job. Why? Because of October 7. Because I was not afraid to stand up to the hateful mob”.He said he was suspended in retaliation for posting multiple videos online of his conversations with university public safety officials last October 7, during a protest by the pro-Palestine Columbia University Apartheid Divest student group. He suggested he would sue the university over the suspension and said that he was “not going anywhere”.“I don’t care about my future”, he later wrote on X. “I care about what this acceptance of anti-Jewish, anti-Israeli, and anti-American terrorism means for the students on campus”.Davidai has recently used his X account, which has more than 100,000 followers, to accuse prominent Columbia professor Rashid Khalidi of being a “spokesperson for Hamas”, and to share the name and email of another professor he suggested was “OK with rape, murder, torture and kidnapping”.Davidai has also harassed and doxxed countless students, many of whom have denounced his abuse over the last year. Some of those students took to social media after Davidai’s suspension to criticise the university for belatedly taking action against him.“I have been reporting him nonstop since October 2023 for many things including making video edits of me and only now that he absolutely lost his mind at Columbia administrators did they finally take action against him,” one student wrote on X on Wednesday.“The Columbia business professor who has: targeted me for months, retweeted inappropriate comments about my body, and claimed I was part of Hamas as we evacuated my family from Gaza (we’re Palestinian Christians) is now banned from Columbia’s campus for harassment,” wrote another.She added that Davidai had, among other things, made a video saying the US National Guard should be called in against student protesters and called campus security officers “members of Nazi Germany”.Despite the many reports accusing him of harassment, it’s Davidai’s intimidation of Cas Holloway, the university’s chief operating officer, that appears to have crossed a line for the university’s administration.“Columbia has consistently and continually respected Assistant Professor Davidai’s right to free speech and to express his views. His freedom of speech has not been limited and is not being limited now,” university spokesperson Millie Wert wrote in a statement to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the university’s student-run newspaper.“Columbia, however, does not tolerate threats of intimidation, harassment, or other threatening behavior by its employees”.Davidai was restricted from entering campus but the suspension won’t impact his compensation or status as a faculty member, and the university offered him alternative office space off campus.He will be allowed back on campus once he “undertakes appropriate training on our policies governing the behavior of our employees”, the spokesperson added.Davidai was denied access to campus last spring after he announced that he planned to enter the “Gaza Solidarity Encampment”, a protest camp set up by students, and called on his supporters to join him.Last April, Columbia University suspended a student activist after video emerged in which the student said “Zionists don’t deserve to live”. Three university deans also resigned after exchanging texts during a meeting about anti-Semitism on campus that the university said “disturbingly touched on ancient anti-Semitic tropes”.The university suspended another student and former Israeli soldier accused of spraying chemicals on pro-Palestine protesters. At the height of the protests last year, administrators twice called police to break up student demonstrations, leading to dozens of arrests.Columbia University’s protest encampment inspired dozens of others on campuses across the US last year.The university was widely criticised for its suppression of the protests, but also came under intense pressure from donors and legislators accusing it of supporting anti-Semitism on campus, leading to Columbia President Minouche Shafik’s resignation over the summer.","Columbia University suspends outspoken pro-Israel professor for harassment","2025-06-28T10:47:07.929953Z"

In recent months, it has repeatedly struck crowded shelters and tent sites, alleging armed groups were using them.“What happened was that we woke up to smoke, flames, fire and burning pieces falling on the tents from every direction.

Twenty-five people were transferred to the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza after suffering severe burns, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.Gaza’s Media Office said it was the seventh time this year that Israel has hit the grounds of Al-Aqsa Hospital and the third in the past couple of weeks, killing Palestinians who were forced to flee their homes.Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said more than 20 tents were destroyed in the attack.“There were many people inside the tents as the fire spread, who could not be saved,” he said. “We are looking at a large number [of deaths] as these tents are close to each other, back-to-back, and set up in a small space inside the hospital courtyard.”Last week, a United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry (CoI) released a report which found Israel perpetrating “a concerted policy to destroy Gaza’s healthcare system”.The attack on Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital comes after at least 22 people were killed and 80 others wounded late on Sunday when Israeli tanks shelled a school sheltering the displaced in Nuseirat, also in central Gaza.Israel’s assault on Gaza has destroyed large areas of the territory and displaced about 90 percent of its population of 2.3 million people, with many being uprooted repeatedly.Israeli air and ground forces have laid a siege on Jabalia in northern Gaza for days, claiming Hamas fighters have regrouped there. Over the past year, Israeli troops have repeatedly returned to the refugee camp in Jabalia, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation.The attack on Jabalia follows Israeli orders to fully evacuate northern Gaza, including Gaza City. An estimated 400,000 Palestinians remain in the north. The UN says no food has entered northern Gaza since October 1.The Israeli military confirmed that hospitals were also included in its evacuation orders, adding that it had not set a timetable and was working with local authorities to facilitate patient transfers.Fares Abu Hamza, an official with Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service, told The Associated Press news agency that bodies of a “large number of martyrs” remain uncollected from the streets and under rubble in the north.“We are unable to reach them,” he said, adding that dogs were eating some remains.Israel launched its offensive on Gaza after Hamas led an attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing at least 1,139 people, mostly civilians, and seizing around 250 others as hostages, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on Israeli statistics.Israel’s assault on Gaza has killed more than 42,200 people, mostly women and children, and injured about 98,400, according to Palestinian health authorities.","Israeli attack on Gaza hospital tent camp kills four, ignites fire","2025-06-28T10:49:27.792223Z"

This action underscores the United States’ ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel, and to defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks by Iran,” the Pentagon said in a statement.The announcement comes less than two weeks after Iran fired a barrage of missiles at Israel on October 1 in retaliation for the assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders and an Iranian general.Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have vowed to retaliate — spurring fears that the Middle East could be dragged into an all-out regional war.Earlier this month, Biden suggested that Israel should refrain from striking Iran’s nuclear facilities or oilfields, but the Israeli government has repeatedly defied the US president’s public warnings in the past.It is unclear when exactly the US’s THAAD system will be deployed to Israel. An unnamed US official told CBS News that “around 100 troops” will go to the country.Earlier on Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned that Washington was “putting [the] lives of its troops at risk by deploying them to operate US missile systems in Israel”.“While we have made tremendous efforts in recent days to contain an all-out war in our region, I say it clearly that we have no red lines in defending our people and interests,” Araghchi wrote on social media.While the US has said it favours diplomacy and a de-escalation in the region, critics have noted that Washington offers Israel unwavering military and diplomatic support.The US provides Israel with at least $3.8bn in military aid annually, and the Biden administration has authorised $14bn in further assistance to its ally since the Israeli military began its war on the Gaza Strip in October of last year.Israel also recently expanded its bombing campaign in Lebanon, after exchanging fire with Lebanese group Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border for months.Yet despite growing concerns over a widening war, the Biden administration has rebuffed calls to suspend weapons transfers to Israel to pressure the country to end the wars in Gaza and Lebanon.Marwan Bishara, Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst, said “there is no doubt” that Washington’s THAAD system announcement on Sunday would further escalate regional tensions.“I am not sure if President Biden is sleep-walking his way into another regional war … or [if] he has his eyes wide open as he escalates the war,” Bishara said.Israel already uses three integrated missile defence systems to intercept incoming rockets and missiles fired towards the country.But the THAAD system that the US will deploy to Israel has a greater range than other systems and marks a “step up”, Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna reported from Washington, DC.“The important point, too, is that the [THAAD] systems are so complex that it requires a crew of 94 to operate — a trained crew of 94 — and these will be US soldiers,” Hanna said.“This is a system being put in place and it is a significant step up of the US support for Israel as this crisis continues.”Speaking to Al Jazeera, military analyst Elijah Magnier said he believed the THAAD system announcement meant that the expected Israeli attack on Iran is “not imminent”, as Israel would want the missile defence system to be in place before any attack, which will likely be followed by another Iranian attack on Israel.The US previously deployed a THAAD battery to Israel in 2019 for training and an air defence exercise, the Pentagon said on Sunday.Biden also directed the military to send one to the Middle East “to defend American troops and interests in the region” after last year’s October 7 attacks by Hamas on southern Israel.","US deploying THAAD missile defence system, troops to Israel","2025-06-28T10:33:22.274225Z"

The bill needs final approval from the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.“The European Union expresses its grave concern about the draft bill on UNRWA currently discussed in the Israeli parliament,” it said in a statement released on Saturday.The EU emphasised its strong support for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’s position regarding the draft bill that, if passed, could have “disastrous consequences” for the UN agency’s ability to assist and protect Palestinian refugees in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza.“The EU urges the Israeli authorities to ensure that UNRWA is allowed to continue carrying out its crucial work in line with its mandate adopted by the UN General Assembly,” the EU noted.“UNRWA provides essential services to millions of people in Gaza, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and across the region, including Lebanon, Syria and Jordan and is a pillar of regional stability. It also plays a fundamental role in ensuring the conditions on the ground for a credible pathway towards the two-State solution.” Israel has campaigned for years against UNRWA, the main organisation delivering humanitarian aid to Palestinians in occupied Palestinian territory and providing services for Palestinian refugees in other countries since 1949, claiming it has connections with “terrorists” and lobbying for its closure.Earlier this year, Israel alleged that some of the agency’s staff participated in the Hamas-led October 7 attacks on Israel, leading more than a dozen international donors to suspend support.The UN launched an investigation into Israel’s accusations and dismissed nine staff, while the records of others were still being reviewed.

In August, her campaign rejected pleas to allow a Palestinian American speaker at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.And this week, she joined Biden on a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in which the US administration expressed “ironclad” support for Israel.Harris met with Arab and Muslim advocates in Flint, north of Detroit, Michigan – a key battleground state with sizeable Arab communities – on Sunday. Days earlier, her top national security adviser held a similar meeting virtually.Hussein Dabajeh, a Lebanese American political consultant in the Detroit area, decried the lack of transparency around such meetings.He said the Harris campaign is “afraid” to have an open dialogue with representatives of the community, so it is reverting to behind-closed-doors discussions to appear like it is listening to Arab and Muslim Americans.He stressed that the main audience for these meetings is not Arabs and Muslims but the broader electorate as the Democratic Party is trying to portray its candidate as inclusive and caring.“It’s a meeting just to check off the headline. There’s no actual substance behind it,” Dabajeh told Al Jazeera.“It’s unfortunate that the people meeting with them believe after one year of our people getting massacred that these fake meetings are still going to do it.”The Biden administration and campaign – before he dropped out of the presidential race – also held similar meetings that failed to improve his standing among Arab and Muslim Americans or quell the outrage over his support for the war on Gaza.The US provides Israel at least $3.8bn in military aid annually, and the Biden administration has authorised $14bn in further assistance to its ally to help fund the ongoing war.One group that did attend the Flint meeting is Emgage, a Muslim American political advocacy group.“Emgage Action called on Vice President Harris to do everything in her power, should she win, to end the war and reset US policy in the region,” the group said in a statement.“Emgage Action also reiterated the organization and the Muslim community’s disappointment in the handling of the crisis that has endangered the well being of our communities at home and is now widening to a broader regional war.”Deputy Wayne County Executive Assad Turfe, who lost family members during Israel’s 2006 war in Lebanon, also attended the meeting.“I met with Vice President Harris and shared this deeply personal loss. I emphasized that we need her leadership now to help bring an end to the violence,” he wrote in a social media post. “I hope that her administration will take this call seriously and act swiftly to bring the much-needed relief and action that we all hope for.”He said he brought up the issues of displaced people in Lebanon, the need for evacuating US citizens trapped in the country and immediate humanitarian aid.“In these critical times, we may not all agree on strategy, but we must still work together and advocate to end this war and provide relief to the people of Lebanon and Gaza NOW! We must push for action that not only saves lives but restores hope and dignity to those who are suffering,” Turfe said.Emgage raised many eyebrows late last month when it announced it was endorsing Harris’s bid for the White House – days into Israel’s devastating bombing campaign in Lebanon, which has already destroyed large parts of the country.The group, which almost exclusively endorses Democrats and is led by figures who have worked in Democratic administrations, argued that the endorsement is rooted in preventing the Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump, from winning.“This endorsement is not an agreement with Vice President Harris on all issues, but rather, an honest guidance to our voters regarding the difficult choice they confront at the ballot box,” it said in a statement.Emgage also praised the Biden-Harris administration for appointing Muslim Americans to federal jobs.But as the war rages in Gaza and people flee southern Lebanon amid a relentless Israeli bombardment supported by the Biden-Harris administration, some advocates see the nod of support for the vice president not only as misguided but also insulting.Suehaila Amen, a community advocate in Michigan, had a scathing message for Emgage: “I’m disgusted by the fact that none of you have any dignity or honour, that the mass slaughter of Muslims on a global scale isn’t enough for you to hold your head up high.”Michigan is home to a large Lebanese American population, tens of thousands of whom hail from Lebanon’s southern villages and towns that have been largely depopulated and decimated by the Israeli offensiveEmgage and two of its representatives did not return Al Jazeera’s repeated requests for comment on the criticism of the group’s position.Amer Zahr, a Palestinian American activist and comedian, called the Emgage endorsement of Harris a “spit in the face of our community”.“Emgage has announced that, as far as they are concerned, no amount of massacred Arab children is enough to abandon the Biden-Harris administration,” Zahr told Al Jazeera.“According to Emgage, genocide is excusable in order to stay loyal to the Democratic ticket. Their statement openly and proudly states that securing federal appointments trumps repeated vetoes of ceasefire resolutions, proud declarations of Zionism and tens of thousands of Arab bodies under the rubble.”Separately from the Emgage endorsement, 25 Muslim imams and community figures – mostly from Georgia and the Washington, DC, area – penned a joint statement last week backing the vice president.In the endorsement – first reported by NBC News – they credited Harris for speaking out against “the devastating loss of life in Gaza and the unfolding humanitarian crisis” . But the authors avoided any mention of the vice president’s support for the Israeli offensive, which they described as a “genocide”.“When the war in Gaza began, she traveled and met with regional leaders and made clear that the US would pursue a two-state solution, and what reconstruction of Gaza would look like, she also made clear that international humanitarian law must be respected,” the statement said.Several Biden administration officials have decried the suffering in Gaza.For example, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he sees his “own children” in the eyes of Palestinian children enduring displacement and bombardment.Still, according to recent US media reports, Blinken defied assessments by various US officials when he certified that Israel was not blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza – a decision that allowed the US to continue to transfer arms to its ally.And like Blinken, when talking about Palestinian pain, Harris uses passive voice about the atrocities in Gaza and avoids assigning responsibility to Israel.Moreover, Harris often stresses that her support for Israel is “unwavering”. She has been part of an administration that has overseen unconditional support for the brutal war on Gaza, and recently, she welcomed Israeli escalation in Lebanon.When asked recently what she would have done differently from Biden, Harris said “not a thing that comes to mind”, stressing that she has been part of the decision-making process at the White House on most important issues.The Biden-Harris administration has vetoed three proposals at the United Nations Security Council that would have called for a ceasefire in Gaza.This week, Harris described Iran – not Russia or China – as America’s “greatest adversary”, a position that further aligns her with the Netanyahu government.Given Harris’s record and the equally staunch support for Israel of her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, as well as his anti-immigrant rhetoric, many Arab and Muslim voters feel frustrated with the two-party political system in the US.On Monday, the Abandon Harris campaign, a Michigan-based Muslim group that says it aims to hold the Democratic administration “accountable for the Gaza genocide”, endorsed Green Party candidate Jill Stein for president.“Our movement remains dedicated to ensuring that the American people, especially the Muslim-American community, recognize the responsibility we share in standing up against oppression and using all our power to stop genocide — wherever it may arise,” the group said in a statement.“On the precipice of the election, we endorse Jill Stein.”Stein has virtually no chance of winning the presidency, but she has seen a surge of support in Arab and Muslim communities, according to recent polls, in part due to her advocacy for Palestinian rights.Trump has also seen his numbers improve in Arab and Muslim communities, and last month, he was endorsed by the Yemeni American mayor of Hamtramck, a Muslim-majority city in southeast Michigan.As the election nears, recent campaigning has sparked debates about the representation and priorities of Arab and Muslim communities in the US, whose members share similar cultures and religious practices but are not a monolith.“We unequivocally condemn those from our community who continue to exploit the blood of Arab people for their political agenda,” the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said in a statement on Sunday.“This includes individuals and organizations from our community that are in lock-step with the Democratic and Republican parties, putting party over community, politics over justice, and overlooking a genocide for access.”","Amid anger over Israel, Harris courts Arab and Muslim voters.

There is no proof whatsoever.”Al-Zeer explained that he learned about the sanctions earlier this week through media reports. On Monday, the US Department of the Treasury identified al-Zeer as one of three individuals sanctioned for alleged ties to the Palestinian group Hamas, which it called a “terrorist” organisation.The Treasury accused al-Zeer, who lives in the UK and Germany, of being a “senior Hamas representative” who played “a central role in the terrorist group’s European fundraising”.But al-Zeer, the chairman of the European-Palestinian Council for Political Relations, refuted that accusation in a press release on Thursday.Speaking to Al Jazeera afterwards, he explained he never engaged in any financial activities during his years of activism in Europe, including when he served as president of the Palestinian Return Centre, a UK-based advocacy group.“Israel just doesn’t want any activists to work for the sake of Palestine. That’s the whole story,” he said.For al-Zeer, the US’s decision is a reflection of its “broader alignment” with Israel.The US has been a steadfast ally of Israel ever since the country was founded in 1948. That support has continued despite Israel’s current war in Gaza, which has prompted concerns about civilian casualties and human rights abuses.“I am deeply perplexed by the approach taken to reach and announce this decision by a country that supposedly prides itself on legal integrity,” al-Zeer said in his press release.The sanctions were announced on October 7, the anniversary of Hamas’s attack on southern Israel, which killed an estimated 1,139 people.Israel’s response in Gaza, meanwhile, has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians in the year since.“As we mark one year since Hamas’s brutal terrorist attack, [the] Treasury will continue relentlessly degrading the ability of Hamas and other destabilising Iranian proxies to finance their operations and carry out additional violent acts,” Treasury Secretary Janet L Yellen said in a statement.Al-Zeer was sanctioned along with three other individuals and nine businesses that the US Treasury claimed “play critical roles in external fundraising for Hamas, often under the guise of charitable work”.The two other designated individuals are based in Italy and Austria, where they are involved with Palestinian advocacy groups. The Treasury Department also designated a former Yemeni politician living in Turkey and his businesses.The sanctions effectively freeze the four men’s assets in the US and prevents people in the US from doing business with them.“The Treasury Department will use all available tools at our disposal to hold Hamas and its enablers accountable, including those who seek to exploit the situation to secure additional sources of revenue,” Yellen said.The US has announced several rounds of sanctions targeting financial support for Hamas. It has also sanctioned a handful of Israeli settlers and groups supporting illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.Monday’s sanctions were not the first time al-Zeer was accused of being a Hamas operative. In 2019, he won a legal case after World-Check, an influential customer-screening database used by banks, categorised him as linked to “terrorism”.Al-Zeer said the US sanctions cited a photograph that showed him with the late Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, whom Israel assassinated in Iran earlier this year.But he argued the photograph was taken as part of a larger delegations with several European representatives, including British Labour leader Sir Gerald Kaufman. “It is almost laughable,” he said of the evidence.He pledged to combat the accusations. “I have already begun, with the support of a legal team, the necessary legal procedures to challenge these baseless allegations and defend my rights.”","Prominent Palestinian activist slams US sanctions as ‘madness’","2025-06-24T20:35:15.923688Z"

He is a critical and influential voice in promoting a more peaceful region,” Romanowski said in a social media post without explicitly mentioning the Israeli broadcast.“We reject any suggestion of targeting Grand Ayatollah Sistani. The United States continues to support efforts to promote peace in the region,” she added.Channel 14 had shown al-Sistani’s picture with red crosshairs over his head this week alongside photos of Israel’s top adversaries, including Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.Al-Sistani, a 94-year-old Iranian-born Iraqi scholar, is considered one of the highest spiritual authorities by Shia Muslims.He is based in Najaf, south of Baghdad, but he avoids public appearances. One of his last known photos is from a meeting with Pope Francis in 2021.However, he often releases statements that serve as broad political guidance for his followers on major events.For example, in 2014, he issued a religious decree, urging Iraqis to mobilise and defend their country from ISIL (ISIS).The call to arms helped form volunteer paramilitary groups – some linked to Iran – that contributed significantly to the fight against the hardline group.Iran-backed groups are now operating in a coalition called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which has been launching drone attacks against Israel in a push that they say aims to support Palestinians in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.After the Israeli military launched its bombing campaign against Lebanon late in September, al-Sistani’s office condemned what it called Israel’s “brutal aggression” and “savage methods”.It also urged “every possible effort to stop this ongoing barbaric aggression and protect the Lebanese people from its devastating effects”.On Wednesday, the Iraqi government criticised the Israeli channel’s broadcast on al-Sistani, describing it as a “heinous violation” and warning that it could “enlarge the circle of danger and violence” in the region.“We call on the international community to effectively move and show an urgent stance against any call for hatred between peoples,” the Iraqi presidency said in a statement. “We also reassert Iraq’s efforts to end the aggression against Palestine and Lebanon.”","US slams ‘suggestion of targeting’ Muslim scholar al-Sistani by Israeli TV","2025-07-14T22:01:51.495517Z"

Or is it actually responsible for the escalation, exploiting the chaos to advance a hawkish agenda against Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah?The short answer: With its continuing military and diplomatic support for Israel, the US remains a key driver of the violence in the region despite its statements about restraint and calls for a ceasefire, analysts say. While it is difficult to speculate about the administration’s motives or true intentions, there is a growing body of evidence showing that the Biden administration is in lockstep with Israel, not merely a passive ally which is being defied.After a months-long public push for a ceasefire in Gaza, the US has shifted focus to supporting the Israeli offensive in Lebanon.US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin endorsed an Israeli ground campaign in south Lebanon last week which risks becoming a full-scale invasion of the country.“I made it clear that the United States supports Israel’s right to defend itself,” Austin said in a statement on September 30 after a call with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant.“We agreed on the necessity of dismantling attack infrastructure along the border to ensure that Lebanese Hezbollah cannot conduct October 7-style attacks on Israel’s northern communities,” Austin said, referring to the attack by the Palestinian group Hamas on southern Israel during which at least 1,139 people were killed.The Lebanese group had started attacking Israeli military positions in October last year in what it said was an effort to pressure the Israeli government to end its war on Gaza, which it launched after the Hamas attack.For months, the near-daily clashes were largely contained to the border area. The violence pushed tens of thousands of people from both sides of the border to flee. Hezbollah argued that the residents of Israel’s north can return only when the country ends its war on Gaza.After an assassination campaign against Hezbollah’s top military officials, Israel launched an enormous bombing campaign across Lebanon, destroying civilian homes across hundreds of villages and towns late on September 23.Since then, the Israeli violence has displaced more than 1 million people in Lebanon.Before this Israeli escalation, the White House had been saying for months that it was working towards a diplomatic solution to the crisis at the Lebanon-Israel border. US envoy Amos Hochstein made repeated visits to the region, ostensibly to warn against escalation.With the low-level hostilities rapidly turning into an all-out war in Lebanon, the Biden administration rallied Arab and European countries and proposed on September 25 an “immediate” 21-day ceasefire to stop the fighting.Yet, two days later, when Israel assassinated Nasrallah in a huge bomb attack that levelled several residential buildings in Beirut and effectively killed any prospect of an imminent ceasefire, the White House lauded the attack as a “measure of justice”. Nasrallah’s killing was ordered by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from US soil, where he was attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York.Osamah Khalil, a history professor at Syracuse University, questioned the sincerity of Biden’s diplomatic efforts, raising doubt over media reports that Hochstein urged restraint from Israel.Khalil stressed that the US had been a direct participant and backer of Israel’s actions in Gaza and the rest of the region, but that the Biden administration used ceasefire talks as a “domestic politics” ploy to shield itself from criticism at home.“All this was negotiations for the sake of negotiations, particularly as the war became increasingly unpopular,” Khalil told Al Jazeera last month.Two recent US media reports appear to validate Khalil’s assertion.Politico reported on September 30, citing unidentified sources, that senior US officials – including Hochstein and Brett McGurk, the National Security Council coordinator for the Middle East – have privately backed an Israeli military push against Hezbollah.“Behind the scenes, Hochstein, McGurk and other top U.S. national security officials are describing Israel’s Lebanon operations as a history-defining moment — one that will reshape the Middle East for the better for years to come,” the US publication reported. Separately, Axios reported last week that the US is trying to take advantage of the blows Israel has dealt on Hezbollah by pushing for the election of a Lebanese president supported by Washington.The Lebanese presidency has been vacant for nearly two years, with the parliament unable to find a consensus to choose a new leader.On Tuesday, US Department of State spokesperson Matthew Miller described the war in Lebanon as an “opportunity” to change the country politically. He said Washington wanted the Lebanese people to have “the ability to elect a new president [and] the ability to break the stalemate that Hezbollah has had over the country”.Hezbollah and its allies control dozens of seats in the Lebanese parliament as a result of free elections in the country.Reshaping the region has always been a goal for the US neoconservative movement, which promotes support for Israel and elevating US-friendly governments through hawkish foreign policy and military interventions. That approach was most clearly visible under former US President George W Bush.In fact, during the Bush tenure 18 years ago, when Israel had its last major war with Hezbollah, then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke of the “birth pangs of a new Middle East”.Khalil noted that many neoconservatives of the Bush era are now affiliated with the Democratic Party and backing Vice President Kamala Harris for the presidency in the November election.Harris has welcomed the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney, one of the top architects of the so-called “war on terror” and the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq.As the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden himself backed the war in Iraq. So did Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who served as a Democratic staffer on the panel at that time. McGurk was an adviser in the Bush White House and played a key role in the US occupation of Iraq, while Hochstein previously served in the Israeli military.“You have a neoconservative agenda inside the Democratic administration,” Khalil said.As the war rages in Lebanon and the world watches for a possible escalation between Iran and Israel, many analysts say Biden’s failure to put an end to the war in Gaza is what has brought the region to this point.Khalil Jahshan, the executive director of the Arab Center Washington DC, also said the Biden administration’s unconditional support for the Netanyahu government is taking the entire region to “the unknown”.In the year since the Gaza war began, Jahshan told Al Jazeera that the US has shown “total blind support” for not only Israeli policies, but “for Israeli excesses”, as well.“This is the result of a one-sided policy that refused to accept any element of rationality from the beginning of this conflict,” he said.Almost immediately after Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, Biden voiced uncompromising support for the US ally.He backed a “swift, decisive and overwhelming” Israeli response against Hamas. The White House also rushed to seek additional funds from Congress for military aid to Israel to help finance the war.Washington resisted calls for a ceasefire despite the growing humanitarian crisis for months, arguing that Israel had a “right” to go after Hamas.Recent reporting by ProPublica and the Reuters news agency showed that the Biden administration received and ignored internal warnings about possible Israeli war crimes in Gaza and pushed on with its arms transfers to Israel.As domestic and international discontent grew after Israel razed large parts of Gaza, displaced nearly all of the Palestinian territory’s 2.3 million inhabitants and brought them to the verge of famine, Biden began to soften his tone.In recent months, the US adopted the term “ceasefire” to call for a deal that would see an end to the fighting in Gaza and the release of Israeli captives held by Palestinian groups in the besieged enclave.But it has done little to pressure Netanyahu to accept an agreement.Whether Biden and his aides truly wanted a ceasefire and failed to achieve it or they used the diplomatic push as a distraction from the horrors of Israel’s US-backed war, the result is the same – an expanding war and tens of thousands of innocent people getting killed.“The evidence suggests that it’s politically advantageous for them to say they support a ceasefire, but not do anything to actually secure it,” said Ryan Costello, a policy director at the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), a US-based group that promotes US diplomacy with Tehran.Jahshan also said that the Biden administration did not offer fair ceasefire proposals as it continued to arm Israel.“What’s the value of a ceasefire if those who are offering it continue to offer the tools of war to one of the parties,” he said. “That’s not a ceasefire; that’s an invitation to continue the fight.”","Is Biden administration seeking de-escalation – or driving Middle East war?","2025-07-15T17:51:28.010486Z"

Since then, it has become one of the most important maritime routes in the world.On November 19, about six weeks into Israel’s war on Gaza, when Yemen’s Houthis began attacking ships they said were linked to Israel as they passed through the Red Sea to Suez.The Houthis said their actions would continue until Israel ended its war on Gaza.Hundreds of ships were forced to go south by their operators and insurers, bypassing the Red Sea to go around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope.About 12 percent of the world’s trade passes through the Suez Canal, including about 40 percent of Asia-Europe trade.Diverting this much traffic onto a longer route has negatively impacted the global economy, Mamdouh Salama, an expert in energy and transport economics, told Al Jazeera.“Ships taking the Cape of Good Hope route … add about 14 days to voyage time, which means higher costs for transporting goods in addition to higher insurance costs due to the increased risks to which ships are exposed,” he explained.Shipping costs have more than trebled, according to some analyses.Zian Zawaneh, a political economist and former adviser to the International Monetary Fund, said the lack of a clear end date for Houthi operations in the Red Sea makes things worse for shipping companies.There are no comparable alternatives to the Suez Canal despite reports that different solutions were being floated.Some reports said ships were unloading in the United Arab Emirates and the cargo was being transported overland to the Mediterranean.Sami Abu Shehadeh, head of the National Assembly Party in Israel and former member of the Israeli parliament, confirmed “there are indeed goods that have arrived from the Emirates to the Israeli market, but their impact is limited,” adding that this could not compensate for what huge ships move through Suez.Moreover, the cost of the UAE route is much higher.“The Suez Canal remains the shortest, fastest and least expensive route between Asia and Europe. This is the fact that cannot be denied,” Salama said.Egypt had looked to the Suez Canal as a source of revenue it could nurture, investing $8bn to make a large portion of it double-tracked to allow more and bigger ships to move through faster.To raise capital for this, Egypt issued government bonds in 2014 with an interest rate of nearly 12 percent, the highest on the market at the time.Work began in 2014 and was completed in just one year, the government wanting to get revenues quickly and raise morale by completing a megaproject.When the project was opened in August 2015, the then-head of the Suez Canal Authority, Mohab Mamish, promised to raise revenues to $100bn a year.But those expectations never came to pass because global trade did not grow as fast as was hoped and suffered greatly during the COVID-19 pandemic.On July 18, the head of US Central Command, General Michael Kurilla, visited Osama Rabie, head of the Suez Canal Authority, to discuss the situation.Rabie told Kurilla that the canal’s revenues had dropped by nearly 25 percent from $9.4bn in 2022-2023 to $7.2bn in 2023-2024.The $9.4bn figure was the highest the canal has achieved in its history, Rabie said.Zawaneh ties the losses Egypt has sustained to the fact that it signed a $35bn partnership with the UAE to develop a multipurpose megacity in Ras El-Hekma on its north coast.The impact of the Houthi attacks on the Israeli economy has been severe, according to Abu Shehadeh.That is the case especially because “Israel does not have natural resources and relies on imports to meet its various needs,” he said.Abu Shehadeh explained that as the Israeli Red Sea port of Eilat has been practically at a standstill, the cost of getting goods to the Mediterranean ports of Haifa and Ashdod has risen enormously, which has increased costs for consumers.In August, Israel’s consumer price index was at its highest level since October 2023, The Times of Israel reported.Israel has tried to find alternatives, such as air transport or trucking overland via Jordan, but none was “enough to contain the problem”, Abu Shehadeh said.Israel is also losing out on fulfilling its dream of becoming a regional centre for the production and export of liquefied natural gas given the difficulty and expense of getting large tankers to its ports.This year, Israel has seen several monthly budget deficits rise above the 6.6 percent of gross domestic product the government tries to stay within.Abu Shehadeh added that he observed a shift in Israeli society as the government prolonged and expanded its war. The increased pressure on people, he said, has resulted in “thousands of middle-class Israelis [emigrating], … including skilled workers, and this is another cost of this war”.","How did Egypt and Israel’s economies do in a year of Houthi attacks?","2025-06-28T10:43:54.206042Z"

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) says at least 128 journalists and media workers are among the more than 41,000 people killed since Israel launched the devastating war on Gaza in October 2023.Colleagues and the Government’s Media Office in Gaza confirmed Hamad’s death, saying the journalist’s home was deliberately attacked to silence him after he received threats.“Hassan Hamad, the journalist who did not live past the age of 20, resisted for a full year in his own way. He resisted by staying away from his family so they wouldn’t be targeted. He resisted when he struggled to find an internet signal, sitting for an hour or two on the rooftop just to send the videos that reach you in seconds,” a post on Hamad’s X account posted by his colleague said.“At 6am (03:00 GMT), he called me to send his last video. After a call that didn’t last more than a few seconds, he said, ‘There they are, there they are, it’s done,’ and hung up,” the colleague added.According to footage verified by Al Jazeera, Hamad’s body was found in pieces and had to be put into bags and boxes after the Israeli attack.“This is what remains of his body,” one of his colleagues shared in an Instagram post.Hamad had been documenting Israel’s war in Gaza for more than a year and worked as a freelance TV reporter.Palestinian journalist Maha Hussaini said that a few days before Hamad’s death, he had been threatened by an Israeli officer through a Whatsapp message and several calls, ordering him to stop filming in Gaza.“‘Listen, If you continue spreading lies about Israel, we’ll come for you next and turn your family into […] This is your last warning’…” Hussaini posted on X, sharing the message Hamad had received.The Israeli government has not yet commented on his death.“Every time a journalist is killed, injured, arrested, or forced to go to exile, we lose fragments of the truth,” CPJ Program Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna said in a statement on Friday.“Those responsible for these casualties face dual trials: one under international law and another before history’s unforgiving gaze,” he added.","Palestinian journalist, 19, killed in Israeli raid after receiving threats","2025-06-24T20:41:30.120049Z"

Residents in Jabalia have described the intensified attacks as some of the worst in months.“Dozens of explosions from air strikes and tank shelling shook the ground and buildings. It felt like the early days of the war,” Raed, 52, from Jabalia, told the Reuters news agency before his family left for Gaza City on Sunday.On Sunday morning, the Israeli military said its forces had “successfully” encircled the refugee camp and were operating in the area.The army said the decision was taken after intelligence indicated the “presence of terrorists and terror infrastructure in the area of Jabalia … as well as efforts by Hamas to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area”.Israel has destroyed hospitals, schools and residential areas, claiming Hamas was operating under them but providing no proof of its claims. Rights organisations say these attacks amount to war crimes.Meanwhile, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad has said its fighters have targeted “a command and control room” belonging to Israeli forces who were trying to get into Jabalia refugee camp.Reporting from near the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalia, journalist Moath al-Kahlout said that the situation in the north was “deteriorating”, adding that an “entire family” had been killed in the overnight attacks.“The Israeli army dropped leaflets on the Jabalia refugee camp ordering people to flee their homes, and this alarming development suggests that the Israeli army is preparing for further attacks. This may lead to more civilian deaths and injuries,” he said.Military and security analyst Elijah Magnier says Israel’s renewed ground invasion of northern Gaza was “inevitable” as far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich claimed that Palestinian armed resistance groups had recruited “more than a thousand people”.“Israelis have returned to Gaza several times, they’ve returned to the north several times, they’ve destroyed the infrastructure, the hospitals, everything,” Magnier told Al Jazeera.“They will continue doing so unless [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu stops this war.”The Israeli army has called on Palestinians in northern Gaza to flee to designated “safe zones” in southern and central Gaza as it begins a renewed ground offensive. But no place in Gaza is safe for Palestinians, including the so-called “safe zones”, campaigners say.But as some Palestinians begin making the journey southwards, Gaza’s Interior Ministry has called on residents to ignore Israel’s evacuation orders.“Israeli claims about the presence of safe zones in southern Gaza are lies as Israel commits crimes and massacres in all areas of the enclave,” the ministry said in a statement.“We call on citizens in northern Gaza to ignore Israeli threats.”Reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said the difference this time, compared to earlier evacuation orders, is that it is “not only blocks but whole areas”.“Some of those Palestinians who were in the north have refused to evacuate despite the attacks and also the starvation and harsh conditions the blockade has imposed on them. They still refuse to leave,” Khoudary said.She added that a member of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) was also targeted in Sunday’s strikes and was killed.According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, at least 41,870 Palestinians have been killed and 97,166 others injured since the war began on October 7.","Israel launches ground offensive on Jabalia again, killing 17","2025-07-15T20:41:53.106425Z"

They delivered a petition to the UN calling for an end to the “genocide” of the Palestinians.The war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023 when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing 1,139 people and taking more than 200 captive, according to Israeli authorities.Israel’s subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.The war in the besieged enclave has displaced nearly all of its 2.3 million people, who have been subjected to widespread hunger and disease, leading to genocide allegations against Israel by several countries at the International Criminal Court (ICC).Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters in Italy’s capital Rome as their demonstration turned violent, officials said.Several thousand demonstrated peacefully on Saturday afternoon, chanting “Free Palestine, Free Lebanon!” They waved Palestinian flags and held banners calling for an immediate stop to the conflict.The rally had been calm until a smaller group tried to push the rally towards the centre of the city, despite a ban by local authorities who had refused to authorise protests, citing security concerns.Some protesters, dressed in black and with their faces covered, threw stones, bottles and paper bombs at the police, who responded with tear gas and water cannons, eventually dispersing the crowd.At least 30 law enforcement officers and three demonstrators were injured in the clashes, local media reported.Some 40,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through central London on Saturday, one of its biggest rallies in a year.“Unfortunately, in spite of all our goodwill, the Israeli government does not take any notice, and they just go ahead and continue their atrocities in Gaza, now also in Lebanon and in Yemen, and also probably in Iran,” Agnes Kory, a protester in London, told the Reuters news agency.“And our government, our British government, unfortunately is just paying lip service and carries on supplying weapons to Israel,” she added.In Dublin, several hundred people took to the streets, waving Palestinian flags and chanting: “Ceasefire now!”In France, thousands of people marched in Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, Bordeaux and Strasbourg to express solidarity with the Palestinians.Lebanese-French protester Houssam Houssein told Reuters in Paris he feared a “regional war, because there are tensions with Iran at the moment, and perhaps with Iraq and Yemen”.“We really need to stop the war because it’s now become unbearable,” he added.Reporting from the protest site at Paris’s Republique Plaza, Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler said demonstrators expressed frustration the war had been ongoing for more than a year and the “international community is simply not doing anything”.“They feel that France isn’t doing enough to protect civilians and the people who are really suffering,” she said.About 5,000 people joined a pro-Palestinian protest in Madrid, brandishing signs with messages such as “Boycott Israel!”In Washington, more than 1,000 protesters demonstrated outside the White House on Saturday, demanding the US stop providing weapons and aid to Israel.One man attempted to set himself on fire at the protest, succeeding in lighting his left arm ablaze before bystanders and police extinguished the flames, the AFP news agency reported.In the northern German city of Hamburg, about 950 people staged a peaceful demonstration with many waving Palestinian and Lebanese flags or chanting “Stop the Genocide!” the DPA news agency reported, citing a police count.A pro-Palestinian demonstration in the Swiss city of Basel drew several thousand people, the Keystone-ATS news agency reported.Hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators also marched on the Israeli embassy in Athens, which was heavily guarded by riot police.More rallies and candlelight vigils are planned Sunday in cities across Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and the Americas.","Pro-Palestine rallies held globally to mark a year of Israel’s war on Gaza","2025-06-28T10:03:59.678047Z"

On Tuesday, Israel also announced the start of ground operations in southern Lebanon, where its forces have since been locked in combat with Hezbollah fighters.Levina spoke of how Israel was “bombing residential buildings, and just now there was another air strike three kilometres from me on some medical centre.”“It is difficult to cope with this on a human level,” she said.For Russia, her country, the expanding war between Israel and its neighbours is also difficult on a strategic level, say analysts.Russia’s foreign policy under President Vladimir Putin has revolved around a “multipolar world,” an alternative to the US-led world order. With heightened prospects of a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran, and the war also expanding decisively into Lebanon, what does this latest crisis mean for Russia’s interests as a global power?“The ongoing escalation of the Arab-Israeli conflict is of serious concern to Russia,” Alexey Malinin, founder of the Center for International Interaction and Cooperation and member of the Digoria Expert Club think tank, told Al Jazeera, noting Russia’s repeated calls for a diplomatic solution.“However, these efforts are constantly encountering opposition, which is expressed in the desire of the United States to support Israel in almost any situation, primarily in military terms. And this support, which is subsequently used to turn Lebanon into a battlefield, nullifies all statements about the US desire to ensure peace in this region.”In contrast to the United States and its allies’ steadfast support for Israel, Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned the entry of Israeli troops into Lebanon, urging Israel to withdraw the soldiers. Earlier, Russia also condemned the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, saying Israel “bears full responsibility for the subsequent escalation”.But as the conflict spreads, especially to Iran, Russia’s goals are not just based on larger foreign policy principles, point out analysts.Russia has received significant Iranian assistance for its own invasion of Ukraine, tying it to Tehran’s interests in the region.“Russia has been closely cooperating with Iran for the past two-and-a-half years, but exclusively in the military sphere,” said Ruslan Suleymanov, an independent Russian specialist on the Middle East based in Baku, Azerbaijan.“Iranian weapons are in great demand. They have never been in such demand, and Russia has become dependent on Iranian weapons.”Iranian military instructors, Suleymanov said, now visit Russia and are helping to build a factory for the production of Shahed drones inside Russia.“As a result, Russia is forced to support Iran’s allies in the Middle East such as the Hezbollah movement,” Suleymanov said.Whereas Malinin blames Washington for frustrating peace-making efforts, according to Suleymanov, Moscow’s policies in the region are a direct result of “falling into Iran’s orbit”.Both Malinin and Suleymanov, however, agree that Russia doesn’t want another war.“Moscow is not interested in a huge firestorm,” said Suleymanov.“We saw this in April. When it seemed that Iran and Israel were already entering a big war, Russia did not unequivocally take Iran’s side. Russia urged both Iran and Israel to show restraint,” he said, referring to tensions that exploded after Israel struck an Iranian consulate in Damascus in April, killing senior Iranian military commanders, and Iran responded by firing missiles into Israel for the first time ever.At the same time, Suleymanov added, “Russia benefits from the chaos in the Middle East”.“The Americans are now distracted from the war in Ukraine: They need to spend a lot of time resolving the situation in the Middle East.”“But at the same time, the Kremlin would not like to see [another] major war,” he emphasised.Russia and Iran share a mutual antagonism with the United States. They also share a common ally in Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, intervening during his country’s civil war. Russian warplanes bombed rebel-held cities, while Hezbollah fought furiously on the ground. Russia has strategic interests in Syria, including military bases as well as oil and gas deposits.To defuse tensions with Israel, Moscow has used its influence with Tehran to persuade Hezbollah to pull back from the Syrian-Israeli border.Levina, the Beirut-based Russian researcher, said that there was a view among observers that there has existed a tacit understanding between Israel and Russia, over Syria. She cited Israel’s reluctance to supply military hardware to Ukraine in its war against Russia, and said that when Israel strikes Hezbollah positions in southern Syria –  where Moscow’s troops are present – “Russia does nothing, just lets them.”As for Lebanon, Russia’s interests are rather limited. During Soviet times, Lebanese students, especially members of the Communist Party, were invited to attend the Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow – and some sympathy for modern Russia remains, embodied by the billboards of Putin occasionally displayed in the Shia and Orthodox Christian areas.“The USSR were very active with the communist parties here and they had interests in common,” said Levina, including over Palestine and Armenians living in Lebanon.Today, Russia’s relations with Lebanon aren’t as extensive, she said – and when it comes to Hezbollah, have long been complicated.During the Lebanese Civil War, which lasted between 1975 and 1990, Hezbollah purportedly took three Soviet diplomats hostage as a means of pressuring Moscow to use its influence over Syria to stop shelling positions in Tripoli. After one hostage was executed, the KGB reportedly responded by kidnapping and castrating a Hezbollah leader’s relative and delivering the appendage. The rest of the hostages were swiftly released. This account has not been officially verified by either Hezbollah or the Kremlin.The de-facto allies are still not particularly close, and there have been reported tensions over Hezbollah’s continued presence in Syria.On Thursday, a Russian emergency plane evacuated 60 family members of diplomatic staff from Lebanon, but more than 3,000 Russian nationals remain in the country. The same plane delivered 33 tonnes of humanitarian aid, including food, medical supplies and power generators. Further evacuations could follow.Levina, meanwhile, hopes Hezbollah will bog down the Israeli advance.“It was of course very unpleasant, but the ground invasion was, dare I say, good news because this is the third time Israel’s making this mistake,” she said, referring to Israel’s invasion and occupation of Lebanon in 1982, and the war in 2006.“And they’re not learning at all.”","What Russia wants from Israel-Iran escalation: Chaos good, war bad","2025-06-28T10:57:37.811894Z"

Correspondents with the AFP news agency also reported hearing loud explosions in both cities.The Hodeidah strikes hit the airport and the Katheib area, which has a Houthi-controlled military base, Al Masirah said. Footage on social media verified by Al Jazeera’s fact-checking agency showed large plumes of smoke resulting from the strikes in Hodeidah.At least one strike hit Dhamar province, and air raids took place in Bayda province, southeast of Sanaa, the Houthi media office also said.“These actions were taken to protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for US, coalition, and merchant vessels,” CENTCOM said in its post on X, adding that the strikes took place at around 1400GMT.The Associated Press news agency, quoting unnamed US officials, said the strikes targeted weapons systems, bases and other equipment belonging to the Houthis.Al Masirah, which did not elaborate on any damage or casualties, said the United Kingdom also participated in the attacks.But the UK Ministry of Defence has categorically denied any involvement in the strikes, according to an official who spoke to the Al Jazeera office in London.Washington has repeatedly struck Houthi targets in Yemen since January in response to attacks by the group on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.The Houthis say their strikes, which have disrupted maritime traffic in a globally important waterway, target vessels linked to Israel and are intended to signal solidarity with Palestinians and opposition to Israel’s war on Gaza.Now as the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, another Iran-backed group, escalates with Israeli strikes killing about 2,000 people in Lebanon, the Houthis are also demanding Israel halt its assault there.Israel has also struck Yemen with Israeli strikes on Hodeidah last month killing at least five people after the group said it targeted Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport with a missile.The latest strikes came a day after the Houthis said they carried out a drone attack on Tel Aviv. The Israeli military said it intercepted “a suspicious aerial target” off central Israel overnight without giving further details.The attacks also come just days after the Houthis threatened “escalating military operations” targeting Israel after they apparently shot down a US military drone flying over Yemen. And just last week, the group claimed responsibility for an attack targeting American warships.The rebels fired more than a half-dozen ballistic missiles and antiship cruise missiles and launched two drones at three US ships that were travelling through the Bab al-Mandeb strait, but all were intercepted by navy destroyers, according to several US officials.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet publicly released.On Friday, thousands of people took to the streets of Sanaa to express solidarity with the Palestinians and Lebanese people amid intensified attacks by Israel.“The aggression on the capital and Yemeni governorates after the … solidarity marches with Lebanon and Gaza is a desperate attempt to terrorise our people,” Houthi official Hashem Sharaf al-Din told Al Masirah.“Yemen will not be deterred by these attacks and will continue its steadfastness in confronting the enemies with all its strength.”","US air strikes target Houthis in several cities in Yemen","2025-06-24T20:45:35.750219Z"
