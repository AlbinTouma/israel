He was the first high-profile protester to be arrested under Trump’s campaign to expel foreign students who participated in pro-Palestinian advocacy.Just this week, Farbiarz appeared poised to order Khalil’s release, on the basis that his detention under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was unconstitutional.That law stipulates that the secretary of state – in this case, Marco Rubio – has the power to remove foreign nationals who have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”. But Farbiarz ruled that Rubio’s use of the law violated Khalil’s freedom of speech.Still, the Trump administration filed additional court papers saying it had another reason for wanting to deport Khalil.It alleged that Khalil, a permanent US resident, had omitted information from his green-card application that would have otherwise disqualified him from gaining residency.The Trump administration has long accused Khalil of supporting terrorism through his protest-related activities, something the former graduate student has vehemently denied.In the case of his green-card application, it argues that Khalil failed to disclose his work with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), a humanitarian organisation. Politicians in Israel and the US have accused UNRWA of ties to the armed group Hamas, an allegation reportedly made without evidence.Khalil, however, has denied he was ever an “officer” in UNRWA, as alleged. Instead, his legal team points out that he completed a United Nations internship through Columbia University.The Trump administration also argues that Khalil did not accurately identify the length of his employment with the Syria Office of the British Embassy in Beirut. Khalil and his legal team, meanwhile, say he accurately identified his departure date from the job as December 2022.Judge Farbiarz had set Friday morning as a deadline for the Trump administration to appeal Khalil’s release on bail. But that deadline was extended to give the government more time to challenge Khalil’s release.Ultimately, Farbiarz allowed the Trump administration to continue its detention of Khalil. He advised Khalil’s lawyers to seek release on bail from the immigration court where his deportation trial is being held in Louisiana.Farbiarz had been weighing a separate habeas corpus petition from the Khalil team that called into question the constitutionality of his continued detention.Marc Van Der Hout, a lawyer for Khalil, told the Reuters news agency that immigration fraud charges are exceedingly rare, and the Trump administration’s use of such charges was simply a political manoeuvre to keep Khalil in lock-up.“Detaining someone on a charge like this is highly unusual and frankly outrageous,” said Van Der Hout. “There continues to be no constitutional basis for his detention.”Another lawyer representing Khalil, Amy Greer, described the new allegations against his green-card application as part of the government’s “cruel, transparent delay tactics”. She noted that Khalil, a new father whose child was born in April, would miss his first Father’s Day, which falls this Sunday in the US.“Instead of celebrating together, he is languishing in ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] detention as punishment for his advocacy on behalf of his fellow Palestinians,” Greer said in a statement.“It is unjust, it is shocking, and it is disgraceful.”",Judge rules Mahmoud Khalil can remain in custody amid green card dispute,2025-06-24T18:21:23.598228Z

In exchange, some sanctions were lifted from Iran.While the deal was lauded as an achievement of diplomacy, Israel disapproved of the JCPOA. Ten years later, the US and Iran appeared interested in striking another similar deal.The former ostensibly did not want to get dragged into a regional war as tensions mounted across the Middle East, while the latter was again looking for much-needed sanction relief.But Israel’s strikes on Iran, which were reportedly planned months in advance and with US approval, have scuttled any diplomatic solution in the short term, said Akbari.“It’s hard to imagine that someone in the shoes of Iran’s supreme leader [Ali Khamenei] is not taking the side of hardliners after this,” he told Al Jazeera.In response to Israel’s strikes, Iran has launched drones and ballistic missiles at Israel, with some hitting targets on the ground.In the past, Iran’s deterrence against external aggression relied primarily on its self-described “Axis of Resistance”.The axis consisted of powerful armed groups across the region, such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, as well as Syria under former President Bashar al-Assad.However, Hezbollah’s capabilities were degraded significantly during the peak of its recent war with Israel, which lasted from September to late November last year.Al-Assad’s fall in December, the culmination of a more than decade-long civil war in Syria, also compromised Iran’s ability to resupply Hezbollah through Syria, as it used to do.Trump is now exploiting Iran’s weakness by urging it to capitulate to a deal that would see it give up its nuclear programme, said Michael Stephens, an expert on regional response to Iran’s nuclear programme with the Royal United Service Institute (RUSI), a defence think tank.On Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social that Iran must make a deal before there is “nothing left” of the country and that the next Israeli attacks will be even “more brutal”.Later that evening, Israel carried out more air strikes on Iran’s military sites and nuclear facilities.“There are no good options for [Iran] really,” said Stephens.“Either Khamenei … orders his negotiators to compromise on the nuclear file or … he holds firm [and] more sites are hit and further targeted assassinations of high-level officials take place,” he told Al Jazeera.“Either way, if Iran decides to sprint towards a bomb, it’s going to be very, very difficult to do that now,” he added.Despite Iran’s military weakness compared with the US and Israel, it is wary of giving up its nuclear programme, analysts told Al Jazeera.Negar Mortazavi, an expert on Iran with the Centre for International Policy (CIP), said Iranian officials have long referred to the fate of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who agreed to give up his nuclear weapons programme in exchange for US sanction relief in 2003.The deal came after the US President George W Bush had launched his so-called “War on Terror” after the September 11, 2001, attacks, which led to the invasion and prolonged occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.At the time, Bush warned his partners and foes in the region that they were either “with us or against us”.Eight years after Gaddafi gave up his nuclear programme, the US backed a pro-democracy uprising in Libya, which spiralled into an armed rebellion and led to Gaddafi’s overthrow and eventual death.“The [Libya] scenario is something that Iran has taken notice of, and they don’t want to go down that path,” Mortazavi explained.She added that Iran may likely pull out from the JCPOA and try to quickly expand its nuclear programme in reaction to Israel’s ongoing assault.“Just how far and how soon Iran will expand its nuclear programme is unclear,” Mortazavi told Al Jazeera.",Israel strikes may make Iran more determined to pursue nuclear programme,2025-06-24T20:01:45.696205Z
220,1,2025-06-24T20:41:45.310504Z,166,8.654,irrelevant,"Israel’s war on Gaza rumbles on, even as international condemnation grows.Hamas has expressed that it is ready for a deal to end the war, even offering to turn over the administration of Gaza to a technocratic government. United Nations Security Council members have overwhelmingly voted in favour of a ceasefire, a resolution blocked from passing only by a United States veto.But Israel, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is adamant in its refusal of any agreement that does not include what it calls the “defeat of Hamas”, even if that means endangering the Israeli captives still held in Gaza.“Hamas is already the weakest it’s ever been, and there’s nothing they can do that is remotely comparable to what Israel possesses,” writer and researcher on Israel-Palestine and founder of The Fire These Times podcast Elia Ayoub told Al Jazeera.“There’s ample evidence by now that the only reason this genocide is ongoing is because Netanyahu wants it to continue. It’s clearly just an excuse to keep the war going.”But why would Netanyahu want the war – which is Israel’s longest since 1948, and is causing economic crisis – to continue?One answer is that the war provides a distraction from Netanyahu’s own problems.Israel’s longest-serving prime minister has well-documented legal troubles; he is being tried for corruption.And, aside from that, should a permanent ceasefire be realised, some analysts believe Israeli society will hold Netanyahu accountable for security shortcomings that led to October 7.“He’s afraid once it’s done, eyes will rightfully turn to him over corruption and the failures of October 7,” Diana Buttu, a legal scholar and former adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization, said.And so, Netanyahu has two main tasks. The first is to prolong the war, allowing him to continue using it as an excuse to avoid accountability. The second is to prevent the breakup of his government, while somehow setting himself up for another successful election, which must happen before October 2026.Netanyahu has been “reliant upon Hamas throughout the war”, Mairav Zonszein, an expert on Israel and Palestine for the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera.“The far right and Netanyahu have consistently used Hamas as an excuse not to negotiate or plan for a day after,” she said.The Israeli refusal to negotiate a final end to the war stands in stark contrast to Hamas’s willingness to hand over all captives held in Gaza.Over the last 20 months, much of Hamas’s leadership has been killed. Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’s political leader, was assassinated in Tehran on July 31, and Yahya Sinwar, his successor, was killed in Gaza on October 16.Israel is now claiming it killed Sinwar’s successor and younger brother, Mohammed, though Hamas has yet to confirm his death.Militarily, analysts say, Hamas is estimated to have lost significant strength. It is still conducting some attacks, but fewer and further between than the ambushes it was able to carry out earlier in the war.In a sign that Hamas perhaps understands that it is no longer in a position to rule Gaza, it has also offered to step down from the administration of the Palestinian territory, which it has controlled since 2006, and hand over to a technocratic government.“The technocrat offer is not new,” Hamzé Attar, a Luxembourg-based defence analyst from Gaza, said.“It was on the table since before the invasion of Rafah [which occurred on May 6, 2024]. They want Hamas to give up their arms and give up everything, and Hamas has responded by saying: ‘We’re stepping aside.’”That has been firmly rejected by Israel, which has not endorsed any vision for post-war Gaza.Instead, over the last nearly 20 months, Israel has killed more than 54,300 Palestinians and wounded more than 124,000 in Gaza, according to the territory’s Health Ministry.In addition, Gaza is now “the hungriest place on Earth”, according to the UN, all its inhabitants at risk of famine after Israel strangled aid delivery throughout its war, then completely blocked it from March 2 until May 27.Israel has also turned 70 percent of the enclave into no-go zones.All the while, Israel’s bombing of Gaza continues.Discounting the pretext of destroying Hamas and returning the captives, some analysts believe there is a deeper goal: pushing Palestinians out of Gaza.“Neither Hamas nor the hostages are the targets,” Meron Rappaport, an editor at Local Call, a Hebrew-language news site, said.“The goal is to push the people of Gaza into very few, small and closed areas where food will be delivered scarcely, hoping that the pressure on them will get them to ask to leave the Strip.”“Israel is no longer fighting Hamas,” he added.Netanyahu said in late May that Israel would control the entirety of Gaza by the end of its latest offensive, while many foreign officials and experts have warned either directly or implicitly that Israel’s actions amount to ethnically cleansing Gaza.A recent report in Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper, cited 82 percent of Jewish Israelis supporting the expulsion of the people in Gaza.To do so would have a historic impact, Buttu said, one that Netanyahu might feel he can portray as protecting Israel from a Palestinian state – something he has repeatedly promised to prevent.“He recognises he will be the fall guy or the hero,” Buttu said. “If he is the one who ethnically cleanses Gaza, he becomes the hero.”Until that happens, analysts believe, Palestinians will continue to die at the hands of the Israeli military. Hamas is the pretext and their willingness to negotiate or succumb is of secondary importance.“Benjamin Netanyahu has no intention of ending this war,” Zonszein said. “It doesn’t matter what Hamas offers. They can offer to return all the hostages or give up governance.“This war is going to continue until Netanyahu is forced to stop it, and that can only come from Trump.”Additional reporting by Simon Speakman Cordall",‘Clearly an excuse’: Does Netanyahu really want Hamas gone?,2025-06-24T20:41:45.310582Z

It was chaotic, undignified and unsafe,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini told reporters at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo.“I believe it is a waste of resources and a distraction from atrocities,” Lazzarini continued. “We already have an aid distribution system that is fit for purpose.”“The clock is ticking towards famine, so [the] humanitarian [system] must be allowed to do its life-saving work now,” Lazzarini said.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later acknowledged a “loss of control momentarily” at the distribution centre, but a senior military official said the distribution was nonetheless “a success”.Israel has facilitated the GHF’s efforts and said the model keeps supplies out of Hamas’s hands.The GHF has faced accusations of helping Israel fulfil its military objectives, while excluding Palestinians, bypassing the UN system and failing to adhere to humanitarian principles.The GHF said it had distributed about 8,000 food boxes, equivalent to 462,000 meals, since Israel eased an 11-week blockade of the war-shattered Palestinian enclave last week.The UN and other international aid groups have boycotted the foundation, which they said undermines the principle that humanitarian aid should be distributed independently of the parties to a conflict and based on need.“The model of aid distribution proposed by Israel does not align with core humanitarian principles,” Lazzarini said on Wednesday.“It will deprive a large part of Gaza, the highly vulnerable people, of desperately needed assistance,” he said.He added, “We used to have, before, 400 distribution places, centres in Gaza. With this new system, we are talking about three to four, maximum, distribution places.“So it’s also a way to incite people to be forcibly displaced to get humanitarian assistance,” he said.As a trickle of aid has resumed, Israeli forces – now in control of wide areas of Gaza – have kept up their offensive, killing 3,901 Palestinians since a short ceasefire collapsed in mid-March, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.At least eight people were killed and others were wounded early on Wednesday when Israeli forces targeted the home of journalist Osama al-Arbid, who reportedly survived the strike in the as-Saftawi area in northern Gaza.Medical sources told Al Jazeera that at least 15 people have been killed by Israeli attacks across Gaza since early on Wednesday.The Health Ministry in Gaza said on Monday that at least 3,822 people had been killed in the territory since Israel ended a ceasefire on March 18, taking the war’s overall death toll to 53,977, mostly civilians.","US-backed Gaza aid model ‘distraction from atrocities’, UNRWA chief says",2025-06-24T20:19:05.990649Z
217,1,2025-06-24T20:41:13.372895Z,303,16.76,irrelevant,"A group of seven European nations has called for an end to Israel’s military assault and blockade of Gaza, as the United Nations aid chief says time should not be wasted on an alternative United States-backed proposal to deliver aid to the Palestinian territory.In a joint statement late on Friday, the leaders of Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia, Spain and Norway said they “will not be silent in front of the man-made humanitarian catastrophe that is taking place before our eyes in Gaza” as Israel’s blockade has prevented the delivery of humanitarian aid for two and a half months.“We call upon the government of Israel to immediately reverse its current policy, refrain from further military operations and fully lift the blockade, ensuring safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian aid to be distributed throughout the Gaza strip by international humanitarian actors,” the statement read.“More than 50,000 men, women, and children have lost their lives. Many more could starve to death in the coming days and weeks unless immediate action is taken,” it said.Meanwhile, the Council of Europe, a body that works to safeguard human rights and democracy, also noted that Gaza was suffering from a “deliberate starvation” and warned that Israel was sowing “the seeds for the next Hamas” in the territory, referring to the Palestinian armed group.“The time for a moral reckoning over the treatment of Palestinians has come – and it is long overdue,” said Dora Bakoyannis, rapporteur for the Middle East at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.The European calls came hours after UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said 160,000 pallets of relief and 9,000 trucks were ready to enter Gaza.“To those proposing an alternative modality for aid distribution, let’s not waste time. We already have a plan,” he said in a statement.“We have the people. We have the distribution networks. We have the trust of the communities on the ground. And we have the aid itself – 160,000 pallets of it – ready to move. Now,” he said.“We demand rapid, safe, and unimpeded aid delivery for civilians in need. Let us work.”Israel has halted the entry of food, medication and all other essentials into Gaza since March 2. UN agencies and other humanitarian groups have warned of shrinking food, fuel and medicine supplies to the territory of 2.4 million Palestinians facing acute starvation.Earlier, the US and Israel said they were preparing a plan that would allow the resumption of aid by an NGO, while keeping supplies out of Hamas’s hands.Under the heavily criticised alternative aid plan, the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aims to start work in Gaza by the end of May.It intends to work with private US security and logistics firms to transport aid into Gaza to so-called secure hubs where it will then be distributed by aid groups, a source familiar with the plan told the Reuters news agency. It is unclear how the foundation will be funded.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has also asked Israel to allow humanitarian deliveries by the UN and aid groups to resume now until its infrastructure is fully operational, saying this is essential to “alleviate the ongoing humanitarian pressure”.The UN, however, said it would not work with the foundation because the distribution plan is not impartial, neutral or independent. Israel says the blockade, alongside “military pressure”, is intended to force Hamas to free the remaining captives.On Thursday, senior Hamas official Basem Naim reiterated the group’s position that the entry of aid into Gaza is a prerequisite for any truce talks with Israel.“Access to food, water and medicine is a fundamental human right – not a subject for negotiation,” he said.",Seven European nations urge Israel to ‘reverse its current policy’ on Gaza,2025-06-24T20:41:13.372912Z
187,1,2025-06-24T20:14:25.565628Z,305,151.795,irrelevant,"Washington, DC – Three days, three countries, hundreds of billions of dollars in investments and a geopolitical shift in the United States’s approach to the region: Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East has been eventful.This week, the United States president visited Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in the first planned trip of his second presidency, after attending Pope Francis’s funeral last month.Trump was visibly gleeful throughout the trip as he secured investments, criticised domestic political rivals and heaped praise on Gulf leaders. The word “historic” was used more than a few times by US officials to describe the visits.With Trump returning to the White House, here are five key takeaways from his trip:Addressing an investment summit in Riyadh, Trump promoted a realist approach to the Middle East — one in which the US does not intervene in the affairs of other countries.He took a swipe at neoconservatives who oversaw the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as he lauded Gulf leaders for developing the region.“This great transformation has not come from Western intervention or flying people in beautiful planes, giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs,” he said.“The gleaming marbles of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called nation-builders, neo-cons or liberal nonprofits like those who spent trillions and trillions of dollars failing to develop Kabul, Baghdad, so many other cities.”Trump built his political brand with his “America First” slogan, calling for the US to focus on its own issues instead of helping — or bombing — foreign countries.But his words at the investment summit marked a stern rebuke of the neo-cons who dominated Trump’s Republican Party a decade ago.“In the end, the so-called nation-builders wrecked far more nations than they built, and the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves,” Trump said.It is rare for US presidents to travel to the Middle East and not visit Israel, but Trump omitted the US ally from his itinerary as he toured the region.Skipping Israel was seen as a reflection of the deteriorating ties between the US administration and the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.This week’s trip also came in the context of several moves perceived as evidence of the US marginalising Israel. The US has continued to hold talks with Israel’s rival Iran, announced a ceasefire with the Houthis in Yemen, and conducted unilateral negotiations to release Israeli soldier Edan Alexander, a US citizen, from Hamas captivity.Moreover, while touring the Gulf, Trump did not use his remarks to prioritise the establishment of formal diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which had been a top goal during his first term.It remains unclear how Trump’s decisions will affect the “special relationship” between the two allies, but experts say it is becoming increasingly apparent that the US no longer views the Middle East solely through the lens of Israel.“Is it a tactical problem for Netanyahu and the entire pro-Israel lobby? I think it is,” Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University, said of Trump’s shift.“It does throw a wrench in the machinery because it is a president who is showing openly daylight with Israeli decision-making, and not just in rhetoric, but acting on it — leaving Israel out of the process.”With that chasm emerging, some Palestinian rights advocates had hoped that the US president’s trip to the region would see Washington pursue a deal to end Israel’s war on Gaza.But as Trump marvelled at the luxurious buildings in the Gulf, Israel intensified its bombardment to destroy what’s left of the Palestinian territory.No ceasefire was announced, despite reports of continuing talks in Doha. And Israel appears to be pushing forward with its plan to expand its assault on Gaza as it continues to block aid for the nearly two million people in the enclave, leading to fears of famine.United Nations experts and rights groups have described the situation as a genocide.But despite preaching “peace and prosperity” for both Israelis and Palestinians, Trump made no strong push to end the war during this week’s trip.On Thursday, Trump suggested that he has not given up on the idea of depopulating Gaza and turning it over to the US — a proposal that legal experts say amounts to ethnic cleansing.“I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good. Make it a freedom zone,” he said. “Let the United States get involved, and make it just a freedom zone.”In a move that surprised many observers, Trump announced from Riyadh that he will offer sanction relief to Syria, as the country emerges from a decade-plus civil war.Trump also met with interim Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa and described him as a “young, attractive guy”.A wholesale lifting of sanctions was not expected, in part because of Israel’s hostility to the new authorities in Syria. Israeli officials often describe al-Sharaa, who led al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria before severing ties with the group, as a “terrorist”.But Trump said he made the decision to lift the economic penalties against Syria at the request of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.“I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,” the US president said.The White House said on Wednesday that Trump had a list of requests for al-Sharaa, including establishing diplomatic relations with Israel and deporting “Palestinian terrorists”.Removing US sanctions, which had been imposed on the government of former President Bashar al-Assad, is likely to be a boost for the new Syrian authorities, who are grappling with an ailing economy after years of conflict.“Lifting sanctions on Syria represents a fundamental turning point,” Ibrahim Nafi Qushji, an economist, told Al Jazeera.“The Syrian economy will transition from interacting with developing economies to integrating with more developed ones, potentially significantly reshaping trade and investment relations.”In Saudi Arabia, Trump declared that he wants a deal with Iran — and he wants it done quickly.“We really want them to be a successful country,” the US president said of Iran.“We want them to be a wonderful, safe, great country, but they cannot have a nuclear weapon. This is an offer that will not last forever. The time is right now for them to choose.”Trump warned Iran that, if it rejects his “olive branch”, he would impose a “massive maximum pressure” against Tehran and choke off its oil exports.Notably, Trump did not threaten explicit military action against Iran, a departure from his previous rhetoric. In late March, for instance, he told NBC News, “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing.”Iran says it is not seeking nuclear weapons and would welcome a stringent monitoring programme of its nuclear facilities.But Israel and some hawks want the Iranian nuclear programme completely dismantled, not just scaled back.US and Iranian officials have held multiple rounds of talks this year, but Tehran says it has not received an official offer from Washington. And Trump officials have not explicitly indicated what the endgame of the talks is.US envoy Steve Witkoff said last month that Iran “must stop and eliminate” uranium enrichment, but days earlier, he had suggested that enrichment should be brought down to civilian energy levels.Several Gulf countries, including the three that Trump visited this week, have welcomed the nuclear negotiations, as relations between Iran and its Arab neighbours have grown more stable in recent years.Before entering politics, Trump was a real estate mogul who played up his celebrity persona as a mega-rich dealmaker. He appears to have brought that business mindset to the White House.While in the wealthy Gulf region, Trump was in his element. He announced deals that would see Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE buy US arms and invest in American firms. According to the White House, Trump secured a total of $2 trillion in investments from the Middle East during the trip.And his administration is framing the deals as a major political and economic victory for Trump.“While it took President Biden nearly four years to secure $1 trillion in investments, President Trump achieved this in his first month, with additional investment commitments continuing to roll in,” the White House said.“President Trump is accelerating investment in America and securing fair trade deals around the world, paving the way for a new Golden Age of lasting prosperity for generations to come.”",Five key takeaways from US President Donald Trump’s Middle East trip,2025-06-24T20:14:25.565653Z

For many Palestinians in Gaza, community kitchens were their only source of nutrition after Israeli forces destroyed almost all food production facilities.WFP has appealed to the international community to put pressure on Israel to lift the blockade, saying more than 116,000 metric tonnes of food assistance – enough to feed one million people for up to four months – are already positioned for delivery “as soon as borders reopen”.Reporting from Deir el-Balah on Saturday, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said the humanitarian crisis in the besieged territory “has reached a very unprecedented breaking point”.“Civilians are really struggling to cope with this crisis,” he said.Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, said the crisis was “man-made”.Michael Fakhri, UN rapporteur on the right to food, said Israel is “executing this starvation campaign with no repercussions”.The World Health Organization said the situation was no different for medical supplies, with WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus pleading on X for the aid blockade to end.At least 2,062 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel resumed its deadly campaign against Hamas on March 18, and more than 50,000 since October 7, 2023.

For a moment, he could not breathe.When he lifted his head, the al-Zeini home was gone.“Just like that, the house had collapsed into a smouldering heap of rubble and twisted metal,” the 30-year-old civil servant said.“All 12 al-Zeinis – mostly women and kids – who were inside on a peaceful Ramadan evening, were killed,” he said in pain.The al-Zeini family had been killed in a raid ordered by United States President Donald Trump.Trump claimed he wanted to target Houthi fighters and military installations, to force them to stop attacking Israeli-linked ships in the Red Sea – which the Houthis say they are doing in response to Israel’s ongoing blockade of the Gaza Strip.The US raids continued, and have killed at least 53 people, while nearly 100 others were wounded.Mohammed, palms bleeding from the force with which he was hurled onto the asphalt, raced to the house to see if there were any survivors.The house had been demolished, along with the one right next to it.He joined a crowd of neighbours pulling away bricks and iron rebar in search of people, to ultimately realise no one was alive.“I was swept away by emotions and thoughts, just like my surroundings. I was confused, scared, grateful, alarmed, happy to have survived, and devastated by what happened to this family.“This was a family breaking their fast together, not a military base. Americans make no distinction between a rebel and a child,” he told Al Jazeera.He could not say anything further about his slain relatives, only saying he dreaded what would come next.He vividly recalled how the joyful sounds of children playing were suddenly replaced by piercing screams as panicked parents rushed into the streets, desperately searching for their little ones.Like Khawla*, who was a few houses down from the al-Zeinis, setting the table and keeping an eye on her two sons, eight-year-old Usama and six-year-old Mustafa, playing outside.They were awaiting their father’s return before the family could sit down to break their fast.With the ground shaking and the explosive sound of the raid, the alarmed 30-year-old mother rushed outside in panic, looking for any trace of her little ones.“My children were there moments ago, and suddenly I couldn’t see them,” she said.“I staggered through the wreckage strewn across the street, the air was still full of dust. I was terrified.“I screamed out their names … nothing,” she said, her voice cracking as she recalled that night.“A neighbour spotted two small bodies flung several metres away by the blast’s force,” Khawla, who asked to be referred to by her first name only, said.The neighbour scooped them into his arms and carried them into Khawla’s home, afraid that another attack might follow, and feeling it would be safer to be indoors.“I chased after him, sobbing and trying to understand how badly my boys were hurt. They were too shocked to respond, but once inside, I frantically examined every inch of their bodies.”Luckily, the boys’ injuries were limited to bruises and cuts all over their bodies, and she was able to tend to them herself.“These are cuts that are curable, but there are scars too deep and much more difficult to fix. My kids haven’t been themselves since.”The boys keep asking if more bombs will fall on the neighbourhood, she added.“I hug them, avoid answering the question … but I can’t get over the sight of the household whose children didn’t make it.”* Names changed for the individuals’ safetyThis article was published in collaboration with Egab.",‘Just like that’: Yemeni families destroyed by US air strikes,2025-06-24T20:03:51.245252Z

One PRCS first responder is still missing.The group said the those killed “were targeted by the Israeli occupation forces while performing their humanitarian duties as they were heading to the Hashashin area of Rafah to provide first aid to a number of people injured by Israeli shelling in the area”.“The occupation’s targeting of Red Crescent medics … can only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law, which the occupation continues to violate before the eyes of the entire world.”In an earlier statement the Red Crescent said the bodies “were recovered with difficulty as they were buried in the sand, with some showing signs of decomposition”.PRCS President Younis al-Khatib condemned Israel for targeting its paramedics as they “fulfil their humanitarian mission”.“Those souls are not mere numbers.

However, as the truce fell apart, the Yemeni group threatened to resume its campaign.National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on Sunday that the Houthi threat is forcing 75 percent of US-flagged shipping to take the far-longer route around the southern coast of Africa rather than going through the Suez Canal.The Houthis have also claimed attacks targeting Israel in recent days.

Some see the Houthis as an Iranian proxy, while others view the Houthis as a group friendly to Iran, but independent.According to his public comments, US President Donald Trump falls in the first camp.Washington will view “every shot” fired by the Houthis as a shot fired by Iran that could bring about “dire consequences”, he said.Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, however, said on Friday that his country has no need for proxies and that the Houthis act in their own interests.Do Iran and the Houthis operate hand in hand? Or is it more nuanced than that? Let’s take a closer look:Officially known as Ansar Allah (supporters of God), the Houthis are a political and military movement that emerged in the 1990s but rose to international prominence in 2014 when they took control of the Yemeni capital, Sanaa.After months of fighting with the Yemeni government and other forces, a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia with support from the US and the United Arab Emirates, among others, intervened militarily against the Houthis.But the group is still in control of Sanaa and, if anything, has grown stronger over the past decade.Since the beginning of Israel’s war on Gaza, the Houthis have been attacking Israel-linked ships heading through the Red Sea, and launching direct missile and drone attacks on Israel to pressure it to end its war on the besieged enclave.Tehran has publicly backed the Yemeni armed group for years but denies directly providing it with advanced weaponry that has been used in combat in the past few years.The Houthis say they manufacture weapons domestically, and point out that – as the de facto state in Sanaa and Yemen’s heavily populated northwest – they have taken over weapons stockpiles left behind by the government when it fled south.The group has tried to diversify its arms manufacturing industry, making more weapons domestically while still partly relying on imported parts.Israel said the Houthi projectile that crashed in its territory in July 2024, killing one person and injuring several others, was an Iranian-design suicide drone.Houthi authorities said they planned and executed the strike themselves, and Iran was not in the loop.A United Nations panel of experts also said last year that the Houthis received training from Iran and the Lebanese group Hezbollah and that the Houthis do “not have the capacity to develop and produce, without foreign support, complex weapons systems”.Western countries, however, maintain that Iran has transferred weapons and technologies for ballistic missiles, antiship cruise missiles, and a variety of drones. They also claim that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has trained Houthi soldiers and advises them militarily.The US has alleged the Houthis have also tried to buy weapons and parts through companies in China while working to get antiship cruise missiles from Russia amid the fallout of Moscow’s war in Ukraine.Iranian diplomats frequently host Houthi officials, and Iranian state media hails the group as an important member of the Tehran-led axis of resistance.The two sides were in constant contact during Yemen’s civil war, with Iran condemning coalition attacks on Yemen amid what was described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.The Houthis increased their attacks on the coalition in the aftermath of the 2020 US assassination of Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top general and a main architect of the axis.The Houthis have been known to adopt similar geopolitical rhetoric to Iran, support the principles of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, and the Iranian political system has greatly influenced them.However, the Houthis differ from the Iranian establishment in many ways.The Houthis largely follow the Zaidi school of Shia Islam, which has similarities to but differs from, the Twelver Shia Islam practised in Iran.The Zaidi tradition has been in Yemen for more than 1,000 years – and the Houthis see themselves as part of that legacy, and having grown organically as a local movement, rather than a foreign project.The group has also set out independent political and military objectives, such as gaining control over a unified Yemen and fighting foreign intervention, especially by the US and Israel.The Houthis have demonstrated a willingness to attack Saudi Arabia and the UAE based on Yemeni grievances, particularly those involving air strikes and blockades that devastated the local population.At times, they have ignored Iranian advice, including when they unilaterally declared a ceasefire and held talks with Saudi Arabia in 2019 when Tehran was believed to be in favour of military resistance.Washington has signalled it intends to bomb Yemen in the coming weeks, or even months.The dozens of air strikes across the country to date have killed children and women, along with Houthi fighters.The attacks came after the Houthis threatened to resume their strikes – that had halted after the January 19 ceasefire in Gaza – in opposition to Israel’s blocking of all humanitarian aid from entering the enclave.After Israel killed at least 436 Palestinians in Gaza on Tuesday and continued brutal air strikes, Houthi leader Abdel-Malik al-Houthi promised in a televised speech to take military escalation to the highest level.The Houthis have claimed five rounds of missile and drone attacks against US aircraft carrier the Harry S Truman and its supporting warships.They announced that they launched a missile towards Israel’s Ben Gurion International Airport. The Israeli military said the missile was intercepted.For its part, Iran has warned that all-out regional war could break out if it is attacked.Iran’s mission to the UN also wrote a letter this week to the Security Council to condemn “reckless and provocative” statements by Trump.Hardliners in Tehran have increasingly signalled they will push to build a nuclear bomb if the existence of the Iranian establishment is threatened.",‘Every shot fired’: Are Yemen’s Houthis a proxy force for Iran?,2025-06-24T20:40:56.335541Z
208,1,2025-06-24T20:33:19.253291Z,630,56.179,irrelevant,"Washington, DC – Nader Hashemi, a professor of Middle East and Islamic politics at Georgetown University, has been a vocal critic of efforts to silence pro-Palestine protesters and academics amid Israel’s war in Gaza.Those efforts reached new heights under the administration of President Donald Trump, which last week took the extraordinary measure of detaining and seeking to deport Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent resident married to a US citizen.Then, immigration authorities came for one of Hashemi’s own students. Earlier this week, agents detained Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown’s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, which Hashemi directs.“It’s shocking, and it sort of confirms our worst fears that authoritarian repression on American universities is expanding under the Trump administration,” said Hashemi.Civil liberties groups and rights observers have decried — and challenged — Khalil’s attempted deportation, which Hashemi and other observers describe as an extension of the anti-Palestinian bias in the US government.That has often involved conflating anti-Jewish sentiment and support for Hamas, which the US categorises as a “terrorist organisation”, with statements criticising Israeli military action or support for Palestinians, they say.But Hashemi and his colleagues see the targeting of Suri, who is in the US on a student visa, as going a step further, given that he was detained not for public protests but for his alleged personal views.Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown who focuses on Palestinian-Israel affairs, said the Trump administration’s enforcement efforts appear to be entering “a different realm with this case”, extending beyond student visa holders and US residents sanctioned for their protest activity.“This person seems to have been targeted, not for his activism,” he said, “but simply for being suspected of holding certain views.”For its part, the US Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday confirmed that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had approved Suri’s deportation.Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Rubio made the determination by citing the same law used to justify the attempted deportation of Khalil.It is a provision of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act that gives the secretary of state power to remove any non-citizen whose presence in the US is deemed to have “adverse foreign policy consequences”.McLaughlin accused Suri of “actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media”, without providing further details. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for further information from Al Jazeera.She also said Suri “has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior adviser to Hamas”.On Wednesday, Suri’s wife, Mapheze Saleh, confirmed to Al Jazeera that she is a US citizen. Meanwhile, Ahmed Yousef, a former adviser to assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, confirmed to The New York Times that Suri was his son-in-law.Yousef told the newspaper he had left his position in the political wing of Hamas over a decade ago and has publicly criticised the group’s decision to attack Israel on October 7, 2023. He said that Suri was not involved in “political activism”, much less support for Hamas.Suri has roundly rejected the allegations against him, his lawyer, Hassan Ahmad, told US media. His legal team, which includes the Virginia office of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), has filed a petition at the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia seeking his release.He remained at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centre in Louisiana on Thursday.In a statement on Wednesday, Georgetown University also said it supports its community members “rights to free and open deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable”.Meanwhile, the Alwaleed Center issued a passionate defence of Suri on Thursday, saying he has become the victim of a “campaign by the Trump Administration to destroy higher education in the United States and punish their political opponents”.Both Suri and his wife Saleh had previously been singled out by “Campus Watch”, a project out of the Middle East Forum that says it “reviews and critiques Middle East studies in North American universities”.Critics have accused the project of being a tool to silence criticism of Israel in higher education.Hashemi, meanwhile, described Suri as a “very respected and serious academic”.“In many ways, [Suri] was the exact opposite to Mahmoud Khalil, in the sense that he was not an organiser or a leader. He was simply a researcher and postdoctoral fellow at our centre,” Hashemi said, “who was just working on themes of minority rights, majoritarianism and the problem of authoritarianism.”Elgindy, meanwhile, said the Trump administration continues to embrace a “dangerous conflation” when it comes to complex discussions of Palestinian rights and resistance.“Really any expression of solidarity with Palestinians or criticism of Israel is deemed in and of itself, to be both anti-Semitic and inherently supportive of terrorism and Hamas,” he said.Elgindy described a “genuine atmosphere of fear” when it comes to open academic debate on the complex realities that define the Israel-Palestine conflict.“It really cuts to the heart of academic freedom — if people have to censor themselves, if students are afraid to ask certain questions or raise certain points because maybe someone in the class is recording and is going to share with some of these extremist groups out there that have been doxxing students,” he said.“The intent is to chill debate and to make people second guess whether they should express certain views at all.”On Thursday, Congressman Don Beyer, who represents northern Virginia, also weighed in on Suri’s detainment, calling it a violation of his right to “due process” and a “blatant attack on the First Amendment”, referring to the US Constitution’s protections for freedom of speech.His statement offered a preview of the principles likely to be raised in federal courts.The Trump administration has taken the broad position that those constitutional rights are not extended to temporary visa holders or even US permanent residents.But courts have largely upheld the right of immigrants to enjoy free speech, the freedom of assembly and other basic liberties.Beyer called for a judge to swiftly make a ruling on Suri’s challenge to his imminent deportation, pointing to “the administration’s track record of attempting to deny constitutional rights in ways that are difficult to undo before judicial remedies can be provided”.Late Thursday, a federal judge barred the Trump administration from immediately deporting Suri. His lawyers told Reuters news agency he was awaiting a date for a hearing in immigration court.Both Hashemi and Elgindy, meanwhile, pointed to the need for the academic community to take a firm stand against Trump’s actions, while acknowledging the difficult landscape educators and administrators face.Beyond the risks to professors on temporary work visas, Trump has also pledged to cut federal funds to institutions that do not take severe enough measures against protesters and “agitators”.His administration has already cut $400m in grants and contracts for Columbia University.“I think the worst is yet to come,” Hashemi said. “Unless the people stand up and push back.”","Georgetown researcher arrest escalates Trump speech crackdown, scholars say",2025-06-24T20:33:19.253310Z

There is an unknown number of people still under the rubble.The Government Media Office said: “Most of these martyrs and missing persons are women, children, and the elderly”, adding that in some cases, “entire families” had been killed.Israel claims it is doing this to force Hamas to release the captives being held in Gaza.It also claims it knows that Hamas was rearming and planning a new attack.However, “Israel itself had decided to remove itself from the negotiations for phase two of this deal that would ultimately see an end to the war and the release of all 59 Israeli captives still being held in Gaza”, Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut said.Israel had been trying to avoid moving to the second phase of the ceasefire, with backing from the United States, while Hamas has argued that the deal should continue to phase two, as initially agreed upon.Hamas released a statement on its Telegram accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire and continuing its genocide.It called the attacks a “blatant violation of all international and humanitarian conventions” and said the perilous humanitarian situation and lack of fuel on the ground meant many of the wounded died because they were unable to reach hospitals.What has been the US response?The White House said Israel consulted the US before resuming the attacks.There are about 59 Israeli captives left in Gaza, of whom less than half are believed to still be alive, according to the Israeli government.Hamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire and risking the lives of the captives.The forum of families of captives in Israel said “their greatest fear has come true” and blamed their government for giving up on the captives.“We are shocked, angry, and scared about the deliberate disruption of the process to return our loved ones from the terrible captivity of Hamas,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.We told you about the Israeli claims and how the negotiations actually went.In retrospect, Israel may have never intended to leave Gaza or stop the war.When both sides agreed to a ceasefire, Israel refused to state in writing that it would not resume hostilities after the first phase.Hamas still agreed to the terms after receiving verbal guarantees from mediators – Egypt, Qatar and the US – that Israel would not restart its genocidal war against Palestinians.The US, which supplies most of Israel’s arms and provides it with unwavering support, is the only country with real leverage against Israel, and it is clear that it has again reneged on its promise to protect Palestinian lives from unlawful – likely criminal – Israeli violence.That is very, very hard to believe.Israel’s war in Gaza is also part of a wider conflict it is waging across the region, claiming that it is necessary for its security.It has been bombing southern Lebanon pretty much since a ceasefire was signed between it and the Lebanese government. On March 16, it killed four people in two villages.The same night, Israel killed two people in the Syrian city of Deraa, claiming it was targeting remnants of the regime of ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, although it is not clear why that concerns them.What is more, Israel is continuing its violent campaign of raids on occupied West Bank refugee camps, claiming to be trying to root out Palestinian fighters.However, experts previously told Al Jazeera that armed groups in Palestinian refugee camps do not pose a threat to Israel, having formed in 2021 mostly to respond to Israel’s violent, frequent raids on the camps and its entrenching and increasingly violent occupation, which violates international law.",Why did Israel break the ceasefire in Gaza?,2025-06-24T20:31:52.306231Z

It called on people in Arab and Islamic nations, along with the “free people of the world”, to take to the streets to protest the assault.The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) armed group accused Israel of “deliberately sabotaging all efforts to reach a ceasefire”.Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he ordered the military to take “strong action” against Hamas over its refusal to release captives taken from Israel or agree to offers to extend the ceasefire.“Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.The Israeli military said on Telegram that it was conducting “extensive strikes on terror targets” belonging to Hamas.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Israel had consulted with United States President Donald Trump about the strikes.Ahmed Abu Rizq, a teacher in Gaza, said he and his family woke up to the sound of “Israeli strikes everywhere”.“We were frightened, our children were frightened. We had many calls from our relatives to check, to check [on] ourselves. And the ambulance started to run from one street to another,” Abu Rizq told Al Jazeera, adding that families started to arrive at the local hospital with the “remains of their children” in their hands.Reporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said the strikes were concentrated on heavily built-up neighbourhoods, makeshift schools and residential buildings where people have been sheltering.“We have heard in the past hour a clear presence of Israeli drones and fighter jets across the skies in the central area and we understand that among those who were found as victims during the attack were newborn babies, children, women and the elderly,” Abu Azzoum said, adding that several high-ranking Hamas officials had also been killed.The Government Media Office in Gaza said: “These brutal massacres committed by the Israeli occupation army reaffirm that this occupation only understands the language of killing, destruction, and genocide.“They expose the true intentions of the occupation in shedding the blood of innocent people without the slightest moral or legal restraint, proving that they have a premeditated plan to continue committing genocide against children and women, as seen on the ground. It confirms that this is an occupation thirsty for blood.”Negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire deal, which would see the release of nearly 60 remaining captives and the establishment of a permanent ceasefire, have been at an impasse over Israel’s insistence that the first stage be extended until mid-April.Hamas has released about three dozen captives in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners since the start of the ceasefire.While Israel did not explicitly declare an end to the ceasefire, senior officials indicated that the assault on Gaza would continue.Israeli Minister of Defence Israel Katz said the “gates of hell” would open in the enclave if the remaining captives were not released.“We will not stop fighting until all of the hostages return home and all the war’s aims are achieved,” Katz said in a statement.Reporting from Jordan’s Amman, Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut said that while Israel has accused Hamas of rejecting various proposals made by negotiators, talks had been stalled after Netanyahu refused to begin negotiations on phase two of the ceasefire deal on February 6.“Several Israeli analysts, several within the political opposition and several within Netanyahu’s own government said that this was the plan all along – a resumption of the fighting, to go back to full-scale war,” Salhut said.“And in fact, there’s a new army chief of staff, one who said that 2025 is going to be a year of war – noting that Israel still has a lot of goals to accomplish when it comes to the Gaza Strip, meaning that they are in no way finished with their military action.”Israel’s 18-month war on Gaza has levelled much of the enclave, reducing homes, hospitals and schools to rubble.Israeli forces have so far killed more than 48,000 people in the territory, according to Palestinian health authorities.","At least 404 killed as Israel unleashes strikes on Gaza, breaking ceasefire",2025-06-24T20:37:26.179488Z
196,1,2025-06-24T20:23:58.586221Z,689,133.659,irrelevant,"The United States and Israel have discussed with three East African governments the forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza to Sudan, Somalia and its breakaway region of Somaliland, according to US and Israeli officials quoted by The Associated Press news agency.Friday’s report said officials from Sudan claimed to have rejected overtures from the US, while officials from Somalia and Somaliland told AP they were unaware of any contacts.Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a secret diplomatic initiative, US and Israeli officials confirmed the contacts with Somalia and Somaliland, while the US officials confirmed Sudan as well. They said it was unclear how much progress the efforts made or at what level the discussions took place.The development comes more than a month after US President Donald Trump floated the idea of forcibly displacing Palestinians and “taking over” the Gaza Strip. It was roundly rejected by Palestinians and countries in the Middle East, with many describing it as ethnic cleansing.Separate outreach from the US and Israel to the three potential destinations began last month, days after Trump floated the Gaza plan alongside Netanyahu, according to the US officials, who said Israel was taking the lead in the discussions.There was no immediate reaction to the report from the US or Israel.But Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a longtime advocate of what he calls “voluntary” emigration of Palestinians, said this week that Israel is working to identify countries to take them in. He also said Israel is preparing a “very large emigration department” within its Ministry of Defense.Tamer Qarmout, an associate professor at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera the forced displacement of Palestinians is “a red line that should not be crossed”.He said governments around the world have a responsibility to stop the “outrageous” proposal and “should not be engaging with Israel on any of these scenarios”, especially the displacement of Palestinians to African countries, “many of which continue to struggle from colonial legacies”.“Sudan and Somalia are still ravaged by wars due to the colonial legacy. They [the Israeli government] have to be exposed and put on a shame list,” Qarmout added.In exchange for accepting resettled Palestinians, it is thought that a variety of incentives – financial, diplomatic and security – would be offered to the East African governments.A US official involved in the efforts confirmed to AP that the US was “having a quiet conversation with Somaliland about a range of areas where they can be helpful to the US in exchange for recognition”.The US could offer the breakaway region of more than 3 million people international recognition, which is a priority for Somaliland’s new president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi.Abdirahman Dahir Adan, Somaliland’s foreign minister, told the Reuters news agency denied the breakaway region’s authorities having received a proposal.“I haven’t received such a proposal, and there are no talks with anyone regarding Palestinians,” he said.Meanwhile, it is difficult to understand why Somalia would want to host Palestinians given the country’s strong support for Palestinian self-rule, Sambu Chepkorir, a lawyer and conflict researcher in Nairobi, told AP.“The realignments keep changing, and so maybe there is a hidden agenda in why Somalia,” Chepkorir said.Two Sudanese officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic matter, confirmed the Trump administration has approached the military-led government about accepting Palestinians.One said the contacts began even before Trump’s inauguration, with offers of military assistance against the RSF paramilitary group, assistance with postwar reconstruction and other incentives.Both officials said the Sudanese government rejected the idea. “This suggestion was immediately rebuffed,” said one official. “No one opened this matter again.”","US, Israel want to displace Palestinians from Gaza to East Africa: Report",2025-06-24T20:23:58.586241Z

194,1,2025-06-24T20:19:42.482576Z,719,36.189,relevant,"Israel’s Energy Minister Eli Cohen has ordered an immediate halt to electricity supply to Gaza, threatening the functioning of the enclave’s desalination plants amid an ongoing aid shortage in the holy month of Ramadan.In a post on X, Cohen said he has signed an order to “cut off electricity to the Gaza Strip immediately”. “Enough with the talk, it’s time for action!” he added.Sunday’s announcement comes more than a week after Israel cut off all supplies of goods to the territory to over two million people after reneging on the ceasefire deal that ended the 15-month-long Gaza war. Nearly 50,000 Palestinians have been killed and vast swathes of Gaza have been turned into rubble after non-stop Israeli bombardment.Israel wants to extend the first phase of the three-phase deal, while the Hamas group wants the deal to move to phase two, as initially agreed by both sides. Analysts say Israel’s refusal to enter phase two shows its unwillingness to withdraw its troops from the Philadelphi Corridor, a narrow strip of land that separates Gaza from Egypt.Hamas has accused Israel of “cheap and unacceptable blackmail” over its decision to halt the electricity supply to war-ravaged Gaza in an effort to pressure the group into releasing the captives.“We strongly condemn the occupation’s decision to cut off electricity to Gaza, after depriving it of food, medicine, and water,” Ezzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas’s political bureau said in a statement, adding that it was “a desperate attempt to pressure our people and their resistance through cheap and unacceptable blackmail tactics”.Aid groups and rights campaigners have accused Israel of committing crimes against humanity and violating international humanitarian laws for cutting off aid.People in Gaza are struggling to get bread and basic supplies as Israel’s total blockade has forced the closure of several bakeries and shops.Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Gaza City, said that despite the end to the devasting air strikes on Gaza, civilians continue to suffer due to more than one week of Israeli blockade in place.“Many Palestinians are unable to buy these products, and most of Gaza’s population is currently relying on food assistance.“Food, water and electricity, all aspects of Palestinian life are being affected by Israeli actions,” Khoudary said, adding that the situation on the ground remains “catastrophic”.Hamas has repeatedly called for an immediate start to negotiations on the ceasefire’s second phase. A Hamas source stated on Sunday that its delegation had now left for Doha, Qatar after talks in Cairo, Egypt.Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Khan Younis, said the Hamas representatives were in Cairo to hold meetings with Egyptian officials on the possibilities of implementing the second phase of the ceasefire agreement.“Hamas issued a statement agreeing to the establishment of a technocratic independent committee that will run the Gaza Strip and reiterated calls for the entry of humanitarian aid,” Azzoum added, saying that the group is also calling for Israel’s full withdrawal from the territory as part of any future deal.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, meanwhile, said it would send delegates to Doha on Monday.Earlier on Sunday, two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli attack in Gaza, according to an Al Jazeera correspondent, as fresh truce talks are set to resume in Doha from Monday.The attack on Sunday in Gaza City’s Shujayea neighbourhood wounded several others, with doctors at al-Ahli Arab Hospital describing the condition of some of the injured as critical.Israel’s military said its air strike targeted fighters who “were identified operating in proximity to [Israeli] troops and attempting to plant an explosive device in the ground in northern Gaza”.Al Jazeera’s Khoudary said that Israel has continued to violate the ceasefire that came into effect on January 19. “According to official sources, since the beginning of the Gaza ceasefire, at least 116 Palestinians have been killed and at least 490 others wounded,” she said.“This is why Palestinians are waiting for phase two of the ceasefire, when all Israeli soldiers are supposed to withdraw from all parts of the Gaza Strip.”The six-week first phase saw the release of 25 living Israeli captives and eight bodies in exchange for some 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.During the second phase, Hamas is expected to release all the remaining living captives, mostly male soldiers, in return for the freeing of more Palestinians held in the Israeli prison system. In addition, according to the document agreed to in January, Israel would initiate its “complete withdrawal” from Gaza.The third phase will see the bodies of the remaining captives handed over in return for a three- to five-year reconstruction plan for Gaza to be conducted under international supervision.On Sunday, United States President Donald Trump’s envoy Adam Boehler told NBC News that direct US meetings with Hamas in Doha on the release of captives in Gaza were extremely “helpful”.Boehler stated that he believes something could “come together on Gaza within weeks”, but did not elaborate.Trump had previously floated a widely condemned plan to expel Palestinians from Gaza, prompting Arab leaders to offer an alternative.Their proposal would see Gaza’s reconstruction financed through a trust fund, with the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority returning to govern the territory.“We need more discussion about it, but it’s a good-faith first step,” Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy, told reporters in Washington in response to the Arab plan.Witkoff will be returning to the region this week as he travels to Saudi Arabia for talks on the war in Ukraine.Meanwhile, family members of Israeli captives have demanded the government fully implement the ceasefire.“The war could resume in a week,” Einav Zangauker, the mother of Matan Zangauker, told a crowd in Tel Aviv.“The war won’t bring the hostages back home; it will kill them.”Yoni Ben Menachem, an analyst based in West Jerusalem, says Israel’s return to ceasefire negotiations is a “genuine decision” by the government because it wants to secure the release of the remaining captives.However, “the military option” remains on the table and that could be decided on Sunday evening when Israel’s cabinet meets, he said.Hamas has said that it was ready to abandon its governance role in Gaza but refused to lay down arms.Meanwhile, Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank have continued unabated. On Sunday, Israeli tanks entered areas in and around the village of Wadi Burqin, according to local media reports.The ongoing Israeli operation in Jenin, Tulkarem and other areas began days after the ceasefire in Gaza, with dozens killed, hundreds of homes destroyed, and more than 40,000 people displaced.",Israel cuts off electricity supply to Gaza as new truce talks set to resume,2025-06-24T20:19:42.482601Z

At the same time, Sanad also identified at least six homes razed in Tal as-Sultan, west of Rafah, a little more than 750 metres (820 yards) from the Egyptian border.“This is a war crime because they are destroying residential houses,” Attar said, referring to the fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits the destruction of private property.Meanwhile, Munir al-Bursh, director-general of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said on Tuesday that Israeli attacks, unexploded ordnance, or fatal injuries sustained earlier have killed 118 people since the ceasefire agreement took effect.In addition to military breaches of the ceasefire, Israel has not allowed in sufficient amounts of essential humanitarian aid, such as food, fuel, tents, and emergency shelters.Rafah Mayor Ahmed al-Sufi said most of the city’s residents remain displaced, with an estimated 200,000 people sheltering in the al-Mawasi Khan Younis area and other locations across Gaza, unable to come home.According to him, initial estimates indicate that 90 percent of Rafah’s homes have been damaged, with approximately 52,000 units suffering various degrees of destruction.","Despite ceasefire, Israel still destroying homes in Gaza",2025-06-24T20:31:46.174823Z
186,1,2025-06-24T20:11:53.466692Z,876,95.497,irrelevant,"Jordan’s King Abdullah II has become the first Arab leader to meet Donald Trump in the White House since the United States president’s second term began on January 20.Tuesday’s sit-down with Trump, however, put Abdullah in a delicate situation.While Jordan and the US have historically had strong ties, Trump has repeatedly pressured Abdullah and his government to accept displaced Palestinians from war-torn Gaza, where Israel has conducted a military assault since October 2023.The US, meanwhile, has said it would “take over” and “own” a Gaza emptied of its residents, a proposal critics believe would amount to ethnic cleansing.“It’s not a complex thing to do,” Trump said again on Tuesday. “With the United States being in control of that piece of land — that fairly large piece of land — you’re going to have stability in the Middle East for the first time.”Both Jordan and its ally Egypt have refused to accept forcibly displaced Palestinians.Abdullah’s meeting came as a recent ceasefire in Gaza risks unravelling. Israel has threatened — on the back of remarks from Trump himself — to restart bombing on Saturday if the Palestinian group Hamas does not release all captives by Saturday.But Abdullah avoided directly contradicting Trump during their meeting, alluding instead to an alternative plan soon to be revealed by Egypt.Here are some of the key takeaways from the meeting between Abdullah and Trump.Inside the Oval Office, journalists asked Trump about his comments that the US would take over Gaza and that the Palestinians living there would be moved elsewhere, with no right of return.He was direct in his responses, seemingly deaf to the incredulous nature of some of the questions. Yes, the US would take control of Gaza and rebuild it. Yes, the Palestinians who have been living there for generations — many of them already refugees from what is now Israel — would move to “parcels of land” in Jordan and Egypt.“We’re going to take it. We’re going to hold it. We’re going to cherish it. We’re going to get it going eventually where a lot of jobs are going to be created for the people in the Middle East,” Trump said, without giving specifics.Trump also doubled down on his threats that the ceasefire with Israel would end if Hamas’s leaders do not release the remaining Israeli captives held in the enclave over the next four days.“I don’t think they’re going to make the deadline, personally,” Trump said. “They want to play tough guy. We’ll see how tough they are.”He added that he would not accept a slower timeline: “They either have them out by Saturday at 12 o’clock or all bets are off.”Trump had announced that deadline a day earlier, in seemingly off-the-cuff comments with reporters.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has since echoed Trump’s threats, warning that his military — which has already killed more than 61,700 Palestinians since 2023 — would recommence its bombing campaign in Gaza if the Israeli captives were not released.One issue Trump did seem to back down on, at least in front of Abdullah and the cameras, was his threat that aid could be withheld from Jordan and Egypt if they do not agree to his Gaza displacement plan.“I don’t have to threaten that,” Trump said. “I do believe we’re above that.”In meeting with Trump, the Jordanian monarch was confronting a difficult task: How was he going to reiterate his country’s opposition to Trump’s Gaza plan without offending a president not known for his tolerance for dissent?In the end, Abdullah chose to avoid speaking too much in front of the media, and when he did, his language was careful, precise and designed to avoid offence.When asked whether Jordan would take in Palestinians displaced from Gaza, the Jordanian leader said he would do what was “best” for his country.In social media posts after the meeting, he said that Jordan was “steadfast” in its “position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank”.He added that Arab states would come up with their own plan for Gaza, which would be presented after it was finalised. He also flattered Trump, saying: “I finally see somebody that can take us across the finish line to bring stability, peace and prosperity to all of us in the region.”After the meeting, Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi also said that there is an Arab plan to rebuild Gaza without displacing its people.Some observers believe that Trump’s Gaza plan is a negotiating tactic and that Arab states will be able to come up with a counteroffer.The US president, of course, has his roots in the real estate business.Much of Trump’s money comes from the real estate empire he inherited from his father, and he has since leveraged his family name to license eponymous products, as well as host a reality TV show.Some of those real estate leanings, however, bled into the language he has used when describing his Gaza plan on Tuesday.“I’ve had a great career in real estate,” Trump said nostalgically. “When you’ve done what I’ve done, you can just do more good for people when you’re president.”Trump described Gaza as potentially becoming a “diamond” in the Middle East. However, when asked on Tuesday if he would consider purchasing Gaza as part of his takeover plan, Trump was dismissive.“We’re not going to buy. There’s nothing to buy,” Trump said. “We will have Gaza. No reason to buy. It’s Gaza. It’s a war-torn area.”Critics say his vision for Gaza — redeveloped with hotels, offices and a “riviera” atmosphere — seems divorced from the politics of the region. Palestinians have long withstood pressures to force them from their remaining land, despite decades of continued Israeli occupation.On Tuesday, Trump once again emphasised that Palestinians would not want to stay in Gaza, seemingly ignoring their attachment to their land.That nationalism was most recently seen when hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians used the ceasefire to return to northern Gaza, even if most of their homes had been destroyed by Israel. The majority of them made the journey on foot.Their message was a simple one: that they were not going to leave again.","Key takeaways from meeting between Trump, Jordan’s King Abdullah",2025-06-24T20:11:53.466712Z

According to the ceasefire agreement, the deadline for withdrawal was February 9.The full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the corridor took place a day after Hamas and Israel conducted their fifth captive-prisoner swap, which saw the Palestinian group release three Israeli captives in exchange for 183 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.It also comes on the same day Israel sent a delegation to Qatar for talks ahead of the second phase of the ceasefire deal, according to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. The first phase of the ceasefire began on January 19 and is set to last for at least six weeks.But a source in Netanyahu’s office told Reuters that the delegation would only discuss technical issues, rather than more complicated issues such as Gaza’s post-war administration.In a statement, Hamas said Israel’s complete withdrawal from the Netzarim corridor signals a “continuation of the failure of the goals of the war of extermination against the Palestinian people”.It said the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes and the continuation of the exchange of captives and prisoners refutes Netanyahu’s “lie” about achieving victory in the 15-month war on the enclave.“Gaza will remain a land liberated by the hands of its people and its fighters, and forbidden to the occupying invaders and any external force,” it said.Israel created the corridor at the beginning of its war on Gaza. It is a closed-off military zone that stretches from Israel’s boundary with Gaza to the Mediterranean Sea and is about 6km (3.7 miles) wide.The corridor was named after Netzarim, the last Israeli settlement to be closed in Gaza in 2005, under the then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon’s plan for Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.Reporting from Doha, Qatar, Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker said the corridor was a strategic Israeli military move – giving it access, control and oversight.“For Palestinians, it was yet another land grab – a corridor of suffocation, attacks and death. The Israeli army has been accused of shooting and killing indiscriminately anyone who dared to come near,” she said.“Israeli media have quoted soldiers saying they feel that withdrawing is a failure – leaving behind the corridor that had become a symbol of their power, their control, and their victory,” she added.Reporting from northern Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said the Israeli military’s withdrawal from the corridor is a hope for more free movement for people in the enclave.“It will be very difficult for people who were displaced from this area to return to their homes. It’s hard to imagine where are they going to stay here other than just setting up tents here and there,” he said.“The hope is now that with the withdrawal of the Israeli military, there is more free movement, a flow of vehicles and aid trucks going all the way to the northern part of the Strip,” he added.Mouin Rabbani, a non-resident fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, told Al Jazeera the Netzarim Corridor “shouldn’t have a future” and “should disappear”.“Israel has not only occupied what they call the Netzarim Corridor, but placed numerous structures there that demonstrated their determination to maintain a permanent presence there, to have this capacity to bisect the Gaza Strip, to paralyse transportation and movement within it at will,” he said.“That has failed once again, and they are being compelled to withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor and hopefully never to return.”",Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza’s Netzarim Corridor,2025-06-24T20:31:15.926698Z

He cited statehood, self-determination, and the right of return for Palestinians who fled or were forced out of their homes after the Nakba in 1948 – when Israel was created on the majority of historic Palestine – or subsequent wars.This includes the Trump administration, Naim said. “If there is any chance to meet with any party, including the Trump administration, to discuss in detail how we can achieve such goals, I think there would be no veto within the movement and no objections.”“In politics, it is not about liking someone or not liking someone” Naim added, in reference to the US president. “It is about the interests of all parties.”Naim’s comments followed similar sentiments shared by Hamas’s senior official, Mousa Abu Marzouk, in an interview with The New York Times on January 20. Abu Marzouk said that the group was “prepared for a dialogue with America”, and praised Trump as “a serious president”, crediting him with ending the Israel-Hamas war.The comments appear to signal an overture by Hamas to a US administration, which they hope will deploy a more bullish approach to the conflict even as it remains staunchly pro-Israel.Naim welcomed Trump’s intervention in ceasefire talks that had languished under President Joe Biden, and expressed confidence that the agreement would hold. “We are committed to the deal and exerting maximum efforts to give this deal a chance to succeed,” he told Al Jazeera.He also noted that the strategic alliance between the US and Israel was “so strong that we haven’t witnessed any serious differences between Republicans and Democrats”.“Despite this, we still hope that the current administration can make a change and shift to a new American approach towards the Palestinian question,” he added. “If this happens, I’m sure we are ready to cooperate with any party who is ready to do it.”Naim may voice cautious optimism, but he is also concerned about Trump’s long-term plans, citing the comments about Israel’s “biblical right” to the occupied West Bank by Trump’s nominee to be US ambassador to the United Nations, Elise Stefanik, as “disappointing” and “dangerous”.He warned that the situation in the West Bank, where Israel has carried out deadly raids following the ceasefire in Gaza and settler violence has reached new levels of intensity, as extremely volatile.“We are talking about a very radical, extreme political group of people,” he said. “If nothing happens from above – and especially from the United States, from the Trump administration – on this group of people, I think it is a matter of time before we see the next explosion.”“When it comes to the current situation, change in the United States has helped in reaching a ceasefire agreement,” he added. “President Trump stated clearly that he wanted to see an end to this war before inauguration day and he exercised pressure on the situation to see an end to it.”But Trump’s apparent support for more Israeli land grabs in occupied territory and the prospect of a formal annexation of the West Bank were deeply troubling, Naim said.“When it comes to the long-term strategy… I think it is very dangerous if we are looking for stability and security and prosperity in the region.”“If Trump is planning to stand firmly behind the promises he made, that he wants to see an end to all these wars and that he is looking for peace and stability and normalisation, I’m sure he is aware and his team is aware that a war in the region does not serve these goals,” Naim added.“If he is really planning to achieve stability and security in the region and to concentrate on other issues, he has to exercise pressure on Netanyahu and his racist government and coalition to stop this madness, to stop behaving as a rogue state, or as a state above the law.”“Personally, I believe he will do it,” he added.Sultan Barakat, a political analyst and public policy professor at Qatar Foundation’s Hamad Bin Khalifa University, told Al Jazeera that Hamas emerged from the 15-month war proving its resilience despite Israel’s all-out military efforts to eradicate it.“They are not going anywhere,” Barakat said, adding that this has made the group an ongoing political reality Trump cannot avoid.Hamas, for its part, recognises Trump’s decisive role over his predecessor, while understanding that his administration does not necessarily signal an improvement.“It’s not about him being better for the Palestinians. But I think that they saw the difference he made when he entered the negotiations, the pressure he was able to exert,” said Barakat. “With Biden, for 15 months, they were fed lots of promises, and many red lines that Israel crossed with no consequences.”“They do see him as a serious person who said ‘Stop’,” he added. “But it doesn’t mean that he’s going to be on the side of the Palestinians.”Barakat stressed that there were other moments in the past in which Hamas felt optimistic about US policy towards Palestine, including in 2017, when the group amended its charter and removed language explicitly calling for Israel’s destruction.But the United States “failed them”, Barakat added. While the current ceasefire agreement was a first step, he added, the second and third phases of the deal, concerning reconstruction and governance in Gaza, remained vague.Still, Trump was able to break through a stalemate.“With Biden, they reached the very bottom of what is expected of a world leader. And not only the Palestinians, I think everybody involved in the process felt the same,” Barakat said. “He introduced many red lines and they were all crossed. He couldn’t do anything.”Barakat, who was involved in negotiations between the US and Afghanistan’s Taliban, under the first Trump administration, noted that a similar dynamic played out at the time.“When you have someone who comes in and says, ‘You do this, and we don’t know what he said to the others, but they did it,’ that on the surface is worthy of admiration,” he added. “They admire him. But they don’t trust him moving forward.”",Hamas leaders say they are ‘ready’ to talk with Trump. Do they trust him?,2025-06-24T20:38:08.507105Z

Being a journalist who speaks up for Palestine and against Israel’s genocide and settler-colonial savagery and those who aid and abet it,” he wrote.Abunimah was arrested in Zurich on Saturday before he was set to deliver a speech in the city, sparking outrage from Palestinian rights advocates.The Swiss embassy in Washington, DC, did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.The Reuters news agency reported on Sunday that the Swiss police cited an entry ban and other measures under the country’s immigration law as the reason for Abunimah’s arrest.The Palestinian American journalist said that when he was questioned by police officers, they accused him of “offending against Swiss law” without providing specific charges.He said he was “cut off from communication with the outside world, in a cell 24 hours a day”, adding that he was unable to contact his family. He added that he was only given back his phone at the gate of the plane that flew him to Istanbul.Abunimah noted that during the period when he was taken to prison like a “dangerous criminal”, Switzerland welcomed Israeli President Isaac Herzog to the World Economic Forum in Davos.Herzog has sparked controversy for his stance on Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians. He previously said that there are no “uninvolved civilians” in Gaza.“This ordeal lasted three days but that taste of prison was more than enough to leave me in even greater awe of the Palestinian heroes who endure months and years in the prisons of the genocidal oppressor,” Abunimah said.“More than ever, I know that the debt we owe them is one we can never repay and all of them must be free and they must remain our focus.”United Nations experts had decried Abunimah’s detention as an assault on free speech.Irene Khan, a UN special rapporteur for freedom of opinion and expression, described Abunimah’s arrest as “shocking news” on Saturday and urged his release.Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, also called for an investigation into the incident.“The climate surrounding freedom of speech in Europe is becoming increasingly toxic, and we should all be concerned,” Albanese wrote in a social media post.Abunimah’s detention came amid an increased clampdown on pro-Palestine voices in Europe amid the war on Gaza, which UN experts have compared with genocide.In April, Germany shut down a conference for Palestinian rights advocates and denied entry to the British doctor Ghassan Abu Sittah, who had worked in Gaza.Activists have also accused German authorities of cracking down on protests throughout the war.In October 2024, British counterterrorism police raided the home of Abunimah’s Electronic Intifada colleague Asa Winstanley — an incident that the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said was part of a “disturbing pattern of weaponizing counter-terrorism laws against reporters”.Months earlier, British authorities held journalist Richard Medhurst, who is vocally critical of Israeli policies, for 24 hours as he arrived in London.Medhurst said on Saturday that the “terrorism” investigation against him was extended until May.In Gaza, Israel has killed 205 journalists since the start of the war in October 2023, according to local authorities.","Switzerland releases, deports Palestinian American journalist Ali Abunimah",2025-06-24T20:30:24.748473Z

The sanctions were imposed by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, via an executive order in February.Biden’s actions paved the way for the US Departments of State and the Treasury to sanction several far-right individuals and groups accused of perpetrating violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967 despite international law, freezing their US assets and barring US bodies and individuals from commercial relationships with them.As much of the world’s attention has focused on the war in Gaza, growing violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank and land grabs in the occupied territory have raised concerns among some of Israel’s Western allies.On Monday and Tuesday, settlers set vehicles and properties on fire under the protection of Israeli soldiers. At least 21 Palestinians were reported to have been injured.Since Israel’s war on Gaza began in October 2023, at least 860 Palestinians, including 175 children, have been killed and more than 6,700 wounded in attacks by the Israeli army and settlers across the West Bank, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.“Lifting sanctions on extremist settlers encourages them to commit more crimes against our people,” the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.Israeli officials welcomed Trump’s “historic decision” to reverse the sanctions.Yossi Dagan, head of the Northern West Bank Settlements Council, said the reversal of the “scandalous sanctions” was “a political message that the United States has returned to being our friend,” according to Israeli media.“This is a righting of an injustice of many years, in which distorted policies were pursued by the American administration and also by local elements who confused lovers with enemies,” Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right former national security minister said on X.His ally, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, said Trump’s stand shows his “deep connection to the Jewish people and our historic right to our land”.“These sanctions were a serious act of blatant foreign interference in the internal affairs of the state of Israel and harmed the principles of democracy and the mutual relationship between the two friendly countries,” he said.US sanctions on settlers landed after the Biden administration repeatedly urged the Israeli government to take action to hold settlers to account for actions that Washington believed set back hopes for a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians.Since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Israel has occupied the West Bank of the Jordan River, which Palestinians want as the core of an independent state.

Khan said Israel could still demonstrate its willingness to investigate, even after warrants were issued.This seems unlikely since Israel has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based ICC, denying war crimes despite its apparent failure to investigate the claims.The United States, Israel’s main ally, is also not a member of the ICC. Last week, the US Congress voted to sanction the court in protest against the warrants, a move Khan described as “unwanted and unwelcome”.Khan said Israel had very good legal expertise, but had not used its judges, prosecutors and legal instruments “to properly scrutinise the allegations that we’ve seen in the occupied Palestinian territories”.Khan’s comments came a day after Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire deal in Gaza following more than 460 days of war.Under pressure from hardliners in his government, who say the war has not achieved its objective of wiping out Hamas, Netanyahu delayed key meetings of the security cabinet and the cabinet, which were supposed to vote on the deal on Thursday.The security cabinet approved the ceasefire on Friday, paving the way for government ministers to vote on the deal in a full cabinet meeting.It was not immediately clear when the full cabinet would convene for the vote. A report in The Times of Israel said the second meeting would only be held on Saturday night, with full ratification coming after a mandatory 24-hour grace period to raise objections, raising the possibility that the ceasefire will not come into effect on Sunday as initially planned.Mustafa Barghouti, the secretary-general of political party the Palestinian National Initiative, told Al Jazeera that Netanyahu ran out of options to stop a ceasefire from being implemented.“He manipulated and tried to postpone it and to procrastinate because his main goal is to keep his government together.

195,1,2025-06-24T20:21:44.560638Z,1130,121.703,irrelevant,"Washington, DC – When Samraa Luqman voted for Donald Trump in November, she believed that, even if there were a one-percent chance that the former president would push for a ceasefire in Gaza, he would be a better option than the Democrats who had failed to stop the war.Trump ultimately won that race and is slated to re-enter the White House on Monday. And in the lead-up to his inauguration, Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas have agreed to pause hostilities in Gaza, where more than 46,700 Palestinians have been killed in the last 15 months.But Luqman says she doesn’t feel vindicated, even though Trump has claimed credit for pushing the ceasefire deal over the line.Instead, she’s outraged at outgoing United States President Joe Biden for failing to finalise the agreement months earlier.“I’m just even more angry because Trump, who is not even in office, did a little arm-twisting, and the ceasefire agreement was done right away,” Luqman told Al Jazeera. “This could have happened sooner. It’s so sad, all those extra lives lost.”She added that the way the agreement was reached “solidified Biden’s legacy as Genocide Joe”, a nickname that links the Democratic leader to the Israeli abuses in Gaza.After overwhelmingly backing Democrats in previous elections, many Arab American voters turned against the party and its candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, in November’s race because of their support for Israel’s war.While many Arab voters say it is too early to celebrate the fragile ceasefire agreement, they stress that Trump’s intervention shows that they were right to abandon Harris.The shift in Arab American voting preferences was especially apparent in the swing state of Michigan.In predominantly Arab neighbourhoods on the east side of the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, Harris received less than 20 percent of the votes. The majority of residents either cast their ballots for Trump or Green Party candidate Jill Stein.While Harris argued that she and Biden had been working “tirelessly” to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza, the vice president also pledged to continue arming Israel without any conditions.The Biden administration also vetoed four United Nations Security Council resolutions that would have called for a ceasefire in Gaza.Amer Ghalib, the Yemeni American mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan, was among those who endorsed Trump last year, even appearing at his rallies.He explained that negotiating a ceasefire in Gaza was the top demand of the former president’s Arab and Muslim supporters.“He knew that it was a fair and humane request,” Ghalib told Al Jazeera in a statement.“We supported him and asked for ceasefire, peace, fighting Islamophobia, fair representation for Muslims in his administration and promoting and protecting faith and family values and safe education for our kids. He has shown some signs of moving forward to deliver on every one of his promises.”Both Trump and Biden claimed credit for the ceasefire agreement on Wednesday, with the incoming president asserting that the “epic” deal would not have been reached had he not won the elections in November.It is difficult, however, to assess the extent of Trump’s role in behind-the-scenes diplomacy.But several Israeli media reports have indicated that Trump was decisive in getting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to the pact, which will lead to the release of Israeli captives in Gaza as well as hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.Trump sent his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with mediators in Qatar and Netanyahu in Israel last week.On Thursday, the US president-elect appeared to confirm Israeli accounts that Witkoff pushed Netanyahu to accept the agreement.He shared on social media a Times of Israel article quoting an unidentified Arab official as saying: “Trump envoy swayed Netanyahu more in one meeting than Biden did all year.”Notably, Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani thanked Witkoff by name when announcing the deal on Wednesday.Trump had warned earlier this month that “all hell will break out” if the Israeli captives are not released by the time he takes office on January 20.Some analysts saw the message as a threat to Hamas. But the Palestinian group had repeatedly said that it would accept the ceasefire deal laid out by Biden in May, which included a prisoner exchange and a permanent end to the war.It was Netanyahu who publicly stated on several occasions that his government intends to continue the war.Still, Biden administration officials — including Secretary of State Antony Blinken — have insisted that Hamas has been blocking the agreement.Hala Rharrit, a former US diplomat who resigned last year over the Biden administration’s handling of the war, said the deal announced on Wednesday is the same proposal that had been on the table since May.Rharrit told Al Jazeera that the Biden administration’s months-long failure to finalise the agreement was a “matter of political will”.“If there was not a change in administration, I think we would have kept on hearing the exact same rhetoric of ‘We’re working tirelessly to secure a ceasefire,'” Rharrit said.She added that there would have been no shift had Harris gotten elected, but Trump’s victory created the incentive to make the ceasefire deal happen.Although Wednesday’s announcement sparked jubilation in Gaza, Arab American advocates are cautious about celebrating just yet.It is not clear whether Israel will honour the deal, which does not take effect until Sunday. In neighbouring Lebanon, a US-brokered ceasefire agreement in November has failed to stop daily Israeli attacks.Israel has also killed dozens of people in Gaza, including at least 21 children, since the deal was announced.Suehaila Amen, an Arab American community advocate in Michigan, said she hopes the ceasefire will come to fruition, but stressed that it is difficult to take the word of US and Israeli politicians.Still, she said an agreement reached after Trump’s intervention is further indictment of Biden’s unwillingness to get Israel to end the war.“For many within the community, pushing back against the Biden administration for their continuous funding of a genocide — as well as turning a blind eye to the verified and documented human rights violations — continues to be something we stand by,” Amen told Al Jazeera.Amen said voters are “well aware” that Trump helped complete the ceasefire deal.“As Biden leaves with a bloody legacy of genocide to his name, our work continues to ensure our rights are protected and no further harm or harassment ensues towards the Arab and Muslim American community, from the White House and on down,” she said.The way Walid Fidama sees it, the former president made “concrete promises” to end the war in Gaza when he met with Arab and Muslim advocates before the elections. A lifelong Democrat, the Yemeni American ultimately cast his vote for Trump in November.“We are happy that he helped with the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, and we hope it will not just be temporary,” Fidama told Al Jazeera.“We want the agreement to take full effect and allow displaced people to return to their homes.”But some members of the Arab American community are sceptical that Trump will bring lasting peace to the Middle East, as he promised on the campaign trail. After all, Trump has filled his incoming cabinet with staunchly pro-Israel aides, including Senator Marco Rubio, his nominee for secretary of state.And during his first term, from 2017 to 2021, Trump made a series of policy shifts that bolstered the Netanyahu government, including by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem.Luqman said she is under no illusion that the Republican establishment will distance itself from Israel, but ending the atrocities in Gaza “immediately in order to save more lives” was her top concern.“I’m not going to support Marco Rubio. But at the same time, I’m really conscientious that there aren’t many good options,” Luqman said.",Trump’s role in Gaza ceasefire fuels Arab American anger with Biden,2025-06-24T20:21:44.560677Z

He has been threatening to bolt the coalition if this deal came to a vote, saying this was a bad deal for Israel and that his party would need guarantees that Israel will go back to all-out fighting … after the initial phase [of the agreement].”Netanyahu has faced growing domestic pressure to bring home the scores of captives in Gaza, but his far-right coalition partners have threatened to quit his government if he makes too many concessions.Israeli centrist opposition leader Yair Lapid called on Netanyahu not to back out of the ceasefire deal, reiterating his commitment to supporting the agreement.The Israeli outlet Haaretz reported that the Israeli security cabinet will now “convene to approve the Gaza ceasefire deal on Friday morning”, citing a senior Israeli source.“After the security cabinet meeting, the cabinet is expected to vote on the deal. Israeli ministers have not yet been summoned to discuss the deal,” Haaretz reported.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday also expressed confidence that the agreement would go into effect on Sunday.“I am confident, and I fully expect that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday,” Blinken told a news conference in Washington, DC.Meanwhile, Israeli forces intensified their bombardment across the Gaza Strip, with at least 81 people killed in the past 24 hours, the Gaza Health Ministry said on Thursday.Another 200 were wounded, the ministry added.In one attack, two people were killed and six injured after Israeli forces targeted a school sheltering displaced people in the Zeitoun neighbourhood, south of Gaza City, the Palestinian Civil Defence said.One deadly Israeli attack following the announcement of the ceasefire deal killed 20 Palestinians in Jabalia, northern Gaza.Gaza’s Civil Defence said that in the an-Nazla area of Jabalia, the victims included two children and two women.“As we were celebrating the ceasefire announcement, the Israeli warplanes took us by surprise.

It did not provide an estimate of Palestinian fighters among the dead.That toll represented 2.9 percent of Gaza’s pre-war population, “or approximately one in 35 inhabitants,” the study said.The toll was only for deaths from traumatic injuries, so did not include deaths from a lack of healthcare or food, or the thousands of missing believed to be buried under rubble.Israel’s war in Gaza has killed at least 46,006 Palestinians and wounded 109,378 since October 7, 2023, the territory’s Health Ministry says.The war began on October 7 2023, after Hamas-led attacks across the border with Israel killed at least 1,139 people and led to more than 200 people being taken captive.In the first months of the war, the official Health Ministry death count was based entirely on bodies that arrived in hospitals.It later came to include other methods, including distributing an online survey to Palestinian people inside and outside the Gaza Strip, who were asked to provide data on their ID numbers, names, age at death, sex, location of death, and reporting source.The Lancet study noted that the Palestinian Health Ministry’s capacity for maintaining electronic death records had previously proven reliable, but has currently deteriorated under Israel’s military campaign, which has included raids on hospitals and other healthcare facilities and disruptions to digital communications.On Thursday, Gaza health officials said the Al-Aqsa, Nasser and European hospitals are at risk of imminent closure, after repeated Israeli attacks and blockades of supplies. The Kamal Adwan, Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals have already been forced to close.Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, said that many deaths were going unreported in the north of the Gaza Strip, with bodies being buried in the yards of homes or in the streets, as victims from a renewed Israeli offensive in the area cannot be brought to besieged hospitals.“The entire healthcare system in the northern part of the Strip is out of service, without any proper mechanism for recording the number of casualties in the area,” he said.“It is increasingly difficult to keep track of mass killings during Israel’s relentless attacks.”He said the Al-Aqsa Hospital was now being overwhelmed by a recent influx of injured civilians, many of them women and children.“Doctors are reporting an acute shortage of basic supplies, including surgical tools, antibiotics and painkillers,” he said.Reporting from Deir-el Balah on Friday, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said the Israeli military is escalating its attacks on residential areas.“Medical teams in al-Awda Hospital continue to report that the Israeli army is going on with bulldozing all residential homes in the vicinity of the hospital amid more deterioration taking place among medical cases left there, and it could be a sign of further Israeli escalation taking place within the coming days,” he said.Israel has repeatedly said it goes to great lengths to avoid civilians deaths and accuses Hamas of using hospitals as cover for its operations, which the group has denied.","Deaths from Israeli attacks in Gaza undercounted by 41 percent, study finds",2025-06-24T20:37:18.297974Z

Israel is not a member of the ICC and disputes its jurisdiction.On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Poland’s President Andrzej Duda wrote to Tusk asking that Netanyahu be allowed to attend the commemoration “unhindered”, given the event’s exceptional nature.Malgorzata Paprocka, the head of Duda’s office, confirmed to state news agency PAP on Thursday that a letter had been sent.“In the opinion of the president, there is one issue – precisely because it is the Auschwitz camp, every person from Israel, every representative of the authorities of this country should have the opportunity to take part in this exceptional event,” she said.Prime Minister Tusk, who signed the resolution, said he had received information from the Israeli embassy that the country would be represented by its education minister.Netanyahu has not said whether he would attend the Auschwitz commemoration.

That attack killed at least 1,139 people, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on Israeli statistics, and around 250 others were taken captive.Reporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said the majority of Israeli attacks on Wednesday were concentrated in the north of the Gaza Strip, particularly around Gaza City.An Israeli strike on a Gaza City park killed five people and an attack on a school sheltering displaced people in Jabalia killed four, he said. In central Gaza, at least 10 people were killed in a strike on a family home in the Bureij refugee camp, including women and children, survivors said.“There has been an intensification of air strikes since the early hours of this morning,” Abu Azzoum said, adding that Israeli attacks also injured four telecommunications employees who were working in maintaining internet landlines in Gaza City.“What we saw in the past few hours is very devastating situation, especially in Gaza City, which has been the epicentre of military attacks, especially in densely populated areas,” he said.Rawya Taboura, a nurse at the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza, told Al Jazeera the health facility is subject to direct Israeli shelling “targeting the hospital walls and its surroundings” and preventing aid deliveries.Gaza’s Health Ministry said earlier this week that all three major hospitals in Gaza’s north remain out of service due to the fighting, with the director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital, Abu Safia, remaining detained by Israeli forces.“Unfortunately, so far, no one has been able to provide aid due to the difficulty of the situation outside the hospital and the difficulty of coordinating with the relevant parties,”  Taboura said.“We have not been able to provide aid to the hospital,” she added. “The situation in the hospital is very dire.”Further south, Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis announced it would shut down operations at 5pm (15:00 GMT) on Wednesday due to a lack of fuel, with the Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Deir el-Balah reporting it was out of basic medicine and supplies.On Wednesday, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) was among the international aid groups calling for unhindered access to Gaza. Aid groups have repeatedly accused Israel of stifling aid access.The IFRC said that dire winter weather conditions were “exacerbating the unbearable conditions” in Gaza, with many families left “clinging on to survival in makeshift camps, without even the most basic necessities, such as blankets”.The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), meanwhile, reported that at least 74 children had been killed in Gaza in the first week of 2025, “suffering from attacks, deprivation, and increasing exposure to the cold”.The figure included eight infants and newborns who have died from hypothermia in recent days.More than a million children are among Gaza’s displaced, with many living in makeshift tents with little protection from the elements, the agency said.As the fighting rages in Gaza, Israeli raids have continued across the occupied West Bank.On Wednesday, the Commission of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society (PPS) said 45 Palestinians have been arrested since Tuesday night across the governorates of Hebron, Nablus, Tubas, Tulkarem, Ramallah, and Jerusalem.In Bethlehem, several teachers and students suffered injuries after inhaling tear gas that Israeli soldiers launched at the Kisan School east of Bethlehem, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.The tear gas was reportedly a response to some students throwing stones at Israeli military vehicles.Meanwhile, three Palestinians, including two children, were killed by an Israeli air strike on the town of Tammun on Wednesday in Tubas governorate.The killed children were identified as nine-year-old Rida Bisharat and 10-year-old Hamza Bisharat by the Palestinian Foreign Ministry. It described the strike as a “heinous crime”.The ministry further said Israel’s “application of its aggressive policies in the West Bank” was “in flagrant violation of international law and the Geneva Conventions”.As the fighting continued, mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and the United States were pushing forward with efforts to broker an agreement between Israel and Hamas that would see a ceasefire and exchange of Israeli captives held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Speaking from Paris, France on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken maintained that an agreement was “very close”.However, past efforts to secure a trace have repeatedly failed, with both Hamas and Israel accusing each other of changing the terms.Washington has also been criticised for not imposing more leverage on its “ironclad” ally Israel, to which it provides billions of dollars in military aid.Meanwhile, US President-elect Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy appointee, Steve Witkoff, on Tuesday said he would travel to Doha, Qatar to join the negotiations. He expressed hope that an agreement would be reached before Trump takes office on January 20.For his part, speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Trump told reporters that “all hell will break out” if a deal is not reached by the time he takes office. He declined to define what that means, or if it could spell increased US involvement in the conflict.Later on Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said the bodies of two captives, Youssef and Hamza Ziyadne, had been recovered in Gaza.",Israeli attacks kill dozens in Gaza as ceasefire talks continue,2025-06-24T20:30:29.103239Z
179,1,2025-06-24T20:03:12.546740Z,1193,53.949,irrelevant,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says his government has determined that Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and its allied militias have committed genocide in the war against the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAR) which started in April 2023.Blinken cited the “638,000 Sudanese experiencing the worst famine in Sudan’s recent history, over 30 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, and tens of thousands dead” as reasons for the determination.While Blinken was damning in his criticism of the RSF and its leader,  Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo, the United States administration has continued to defend its ally Israel and its leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, against similar accusations of genocide.It is.Under the 1948 Genocide Convention, genocide is acts intended “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.Under the convention, those acts are; killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.But Blinken did not reference the Genocide Convention.That is not clear.Blinken did make numerous references to the “ethnic” nature of what he described as the systematic murder of men and boys, including infants.He also mentioned the RSF having “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence”, all actions that rights groups and international actors have, on numerous occasions, accused Israel of.The rape and sexual violence Blinken referred to as reasons to conclude the RSF is committing genocide have been repeatedly documented as weapons Israeli forces use against Palestinians.It has.To date, several rights groups and international actors have accused Israel of engaging in war crimes, ethnic cleansing and genocide, while the US consistently defended its ally.In November 2024, US President Joe Biden dismissed the International Criminal Court’s issuing of arrest warrants for war crimes against Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant as “outrageous”.The US has been equally scathing over other international actions intended to halt Israel’s onslaught on Gaza.The argument that Israel is carrying out genocide in Gaza was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) by South Africa in December 2023 and since joined by more than 10 other states.US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby claimed in January the case was “completely without any basis in fact whatsoever”.The US has tried to reject the findings of Amnesty International which, in December, said Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, joining several other rights groups who had said the same.Very.In addition to the 45,936 people Israel has killed in Gaza are the numerous accounts of ethnic cleansing, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, as well as the systematic torture and sexual abuse and rape of Palestinians by Israeli forces.In October, the US issued a 30-day “ultimatum” to Israel that it must do more to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza which was starving as Israel bombed it.A month later, as famine was imminent in northern Gaza as a result of an Israeli “siege within a siege” and its continuing blocking of aid, Secretary Blinken chose to do nothing that was outlined in his ultimatum to Israel.His administration did, however, acknowledge that few, if any, of the ultimatum’s conditions for increased aid had been met.In late December, the US went even further, reportedly ordering the retraction of a report concluding that Israel’s siege on Gaza’s north had resulted in the famine aid agencies had long warned of.In July, even Israeli authorities initially found reason to investigate 10 Israeli soldiers involved in the gang rape of Palestinian prisoners in detention.Despite this, the US has seemed satisfied with voicing “concern” over Israel’s conduct, using its veto in the UN Security Council to block calls for a ceasefire four times and taking no action against its ally.Earlier this year, the Biden administration announced plans to sell a further $8bn in arms to Israel.",Why has the US accused Sudanese militias of genocide – but not Israel?,2025-06-24T20:47:09.673504Z

military offensive that aims to overthrow the government.The foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Turkiye held Astana-format talks, joined by United Nations representatives in Qatar on Saturday, as more Syrian cities fell to the armed opposition groups.Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters after the meeting in Doha that participants agreed that the conflict should end and that political dialogue needs to be established between the Syrian government and “legitimate opposition groups”.He met with his Syrian and Iraqi counterparts in Baghdad a day earlier, their statement saying “continuous coordination, cooperation and diplomatic engagement” is the only way to avoid further escalation.At a joint news conference after the meeting, Iran’s top diplomat said his country would stand with Syria against groups that “are without a doubt carrying out an American-Zionist conspiracy”.Tehran has emphasised the idea that the rebels are foreign-supported in an apparent effort to prevent this offensive from being seen as a mere continuation of the civil war in Syria – which had solidified al-Assad’s position after 13 years of fighting that destroyed much of the country.Iran has also issued stern warnings that fighting in Syria could spread across the region, considering the high level of tension amid Israel’s brutal war on Gaza.The opposition offensive started last week, just after Israel and Hezbollah agreed to a shaky ceasefire deal that has held so far despite numerous violations.It was launched from Idlib by the group controlling the governorate, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), along with allied armed factions.HTS’s chequered past saw it start as al-Qaeda offshoot Jabhat al-Nusra until its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Julani, embraced a more nationalistic – rather than transnational – mission and rebranded as HTS in 2017, ostensibly a more “moderate” group amid the factions competing for Syria.Al-Julani has been at the forefront of a media campaign emphasising HTS’s reformed ways, being filmed in public in Aleppo multiple times, including this week after an Iranian lawmaker proudly proclaimed in parliament that he had been killed in a Russian air strike.He also released videos of himself directly addressing the people and leaders of Syria and the region and gave an interview to CNN on Friday and allowed it to report from Aleppo hours after the city was taken.Asked why people should believe his reforms while HTS remains designated a “terrorist” organisation by the UN, the US and the EU – and there is a $10m reward on his head – he said: “These classifications are primarily political and wrong.”He promised he would build an “institutions-based” Syria that would recognise the country’s ethnic, cultural and sectarian diversities.The Iranian foreign ministry has been hesitant to publicly rebuke Ankara for its backing of HTS, but Araghchi met with his counterpart in Turkiye on Monday for a reportedly tense conversation prior to the talks on Saturday.Ali Akbar Velayati, a longtime foreign policy advisor to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appeared to express disbelief about Turkish support for the Syria offensive earlier this week.“We did not think that Turkiye would fall in the hole dug” by the US and Israel, he said, suggesting that the shifting reality in Syria is Israeli and Western-backed and would harm the whole of the Muslim world.However, Iranian state television late on Friday started referring to the rebels as “armed groups” in an apparent policy shift from calling them “terrorists”.During an address on Friday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan backed the rebel offensive and said he had contacted al-Assad to hold talks and find a solution but did not receive a positive response.“Idlib, Hama, Homs, and of course, the ultimate target is Damascus,” Erdogan said. “Our hope is that this march in Syria proceeds without any accidents or troubles.”Erdogan has been seeking to eliminate an armed Kurdish presence or territory on Turkiye’s borders, as the country tries to resolve a longrunning struggle against armed Kurdish separatists, the outlawed PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party).It also wants to establish a “safe zone” in northern Syria to resettle millions of Syrian refugees currently in Turkiye.Near Iran’s borders to the north, Turkiye is supporting the Zangezur Corridor, a proposed transport route linking Azerbaijan to its exclave Nakhchivan through Armenia’s Syunik Province, which would effectively connect Turkiye, Azerbaijan and Central Asia.If realised, the corridor would sever a significant Iranian route to Europe and bypass Armenian control.Within this context, a major difference between the continuing offensive in Syria and the conflict that started in 2011 is the level of overt support provided to anti-Assad forces by Turkiye, Tehran-based political analyst Ehsan Movahedian said.“While much of the fighting during the time of the civil war was driven by ideology, the nature of the fighting this time predominantly revolves around geopolitical goals,” Movahedian told Al Jazeera.“Turkiye is pursuing an array of geopolitical goals, including dealing a blow to the interests of Iran and the axis of resistance across the region, and reaping potential economic gains by expanding its presence in northern Syria.”Movahedian said Ankara may inadvertently push Arab nations’ stance on Syria closer to Iran since HTS has displayed “radical” thinking over the years that does not enjoy broad backing in the Arab and Islamic world.Iran’s Araghchi has threatened that Tehran could directly send soldiers into Syria, without saying what conditions would prompt Tehran to make that move.The Iranian foreign ministry on Saturday denied reports that Tehran’s embassy in Damascus has been evacuated.But Tehran has not officially commented on media reports that Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) personnel and some other Iran-aligned fighters have evacuated Syria.Especially in this environment, sending in a large number of soldiers would be a significant shift for Iran, which has so far relied on proxy fighters and sending in senior commanders as “military advisers” rather than keeping Iranian boots on the ground. At least one Iranian general has been killed in Syria since the flareup of fighting last week.Two generals and other senior IRGC personnel have been killed in Israeli air strikes since the start of the war on Gaza. Another top IRGC commander was killed in Lebanon in late September as he was in the same bunker with assassinated Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.“Syria is on the brink of collapse and we are watching coolly,” Tehran lawmaker Ahmad Naderi wrote in a post on X, echoing a sentiment that has been reflected by state television commentators as well.“If Damascus falls, we will also lose Lebanon and Iraq and must fight the enemy on our borders. We have given much blood to preserve Syria.”The MP added he does not understand why Iran is not more eager to intervene, but “whatever the reason is, it’s not to the benefit of the country and something must be done before it is too late”.Other members of the Iran-led axis of resistance – Hezbollah in Lebanon and armed factions in Iraq – have expressed their backing for al-Assad’s government.But despite videos circulating online that have purportedly shown tens of thousands of soldiers and heavy arms ready to deploy to Syria from Iraq – and some even entering Syria – there has been no official deployment.HTS in a statement late Friday asserted that it would not invade Lebanon and Al-Julani released a video asking Iraqi forces not to enter Syria, prompting a pro-Iran Kataeb Hezbollah leader to accuse him of using “Zionist-stricken mercenaries”.Iran and Russia would need to send in major military assistance if they want to revitalise al-Assad, according to Aron Lund, a fellow at Century International and a Middle East analyst at the Swedish Defence Research Agency, who said he is “very sceptical” this would happen under current circumstances.He added that sending Iranian troops to Syria would also be risky due to Israeli attacks on Iranian positions there, and Russia may not be prepared to back them with significant air power due to the war in Ukraine.“Whether Assad keeps his regime afloat or not, Syria is unlikely to have a well-functioning central government for a while.“Parts of Syria may just degenerate into warring fiefdoms, with extremism, guns, and refugees pouring out across the borders. There’s a real risk of that, especially along the Jordanian and Iraqi borders.”",Where does Iran stand on Syria’s fast-moving conflict?,2025-06-24T20:18:03.889236Z

He has held various ministerial portfolios since 2003, including agriculture, transportation, intelligence, energy, finance and twice, foreign affairs.Katz was born in 1955 in the city of Ashkelon, a city built not far from the Palestinian village Majdal which was depopulated in the 1948 Nakba.Katz joined the military in 1973 where he served as a paratrooper for four years. After his discharge, he studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.He unsuccessfully ran for a seat in Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, in 1992 and again in 1996. In 1998, he finally won a seat and has since served on several committees.In 2007, Israeli police suggested he be tried for fraud and breach of trust for political appointments while he was agriculture minister. The investigation was closed by the then-attorney general.Some of his decisions in government have been deemed beneficial to Israel’s hyper-conservative Orthodox community and the country’s far-right settlers. He is largely seen as a figure who will be subservient to Netanyahu’s vision for the country and the wider region, which analysts say could include further displacement and ethnic cleansing in Gaza and the West Bank and the depopulation of southern Lebanon.Unlike Gallant, Katz is a relatively peripheral figure in United States-Israeli relations.Gallant had come to be relied on by the Biden administration as a voice of reason who was focused on returning the Israeli captives in Gaza and ending the war.Katz, in contrast, has regularly clashed with the United Nations. He was one of the architects behind Israel’s push to get the international community to defund the UNRWA, which the Knesset banned from working in East Jerusalem last month.In October, he announced that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was unwelcome in Israel. He tweeted a photoshopped image of Guterres kneeling in front of the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khameini.Katz is seen as antagonistic to Palestinians in general and the Palestinian Authority (PA), in particular.As far back as 2011, he called for cutting off relations with the PA. More recently, he promised to “break and dissolve” the PA if the UN moved forwards with resolutions against Israel.In August, he called for the eviction of Palestinians from the occupied West Bank.“We need to address the [terror] threat exactly as we deal with terror infrastructure in Gaza, including the temporary evacuation of Palestinian civilians and any other step needed,” he said at the time.He has previously used the threat of another Nakba against the Palestinians as well.In 2022, addressing the Knesset, Katz said, “Yesterday I warned the Arab students, who are flying Palestine flags at universities: Remember 48. Remember our independence war and your Nakba, don’t stretch the rope too much.

The Ministry of Health in Gaza said at least 25 children were among the dead.Israel’s military said it was “looking into the reports of the strike”, while its main ally, the United States, called the attack “horrifying”.The United Nations Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said it was “appalled” by the bombing, describing it one of the deadliest single attacks in Gaza in nearly three months. The UN’s humanitarian agency (OCHA) said the assault on the Abu Nasr family home was among seven “mass casualty incidents” in Gaza in the past week alone.Israel’s escalating air and ground assault on Beit Lahiya comes as its siege of northern Gaza has entered its 26th day.The Israeli military said it launched the offensive to stop Hamas fighters from regrouping in the north of the territory, despite saying earlier this year that it had wiped out the Palestinian group – which governs Gaza – in the area.According to the the Palestinian Civil Defence, more than 100,000 people remain trapped in the north without food and water and dozens remain buried in the rubble of bombed homes, with rescue workers unable to reach them due to Israel’s ongoing siege and attacks.Footage from the Israeli assault on the Abu Nasr family home early on Tuesday, obtained by Al Jazeera, showed a Palestinian man covered in dust trapped under concrete and steel bars as others tried to break apart walls using pick axes to free him. Outside the building, several bodies wrapped in blankets lay on the ground.Ismail Ouaida, a witness, said the Israeli attack came without warning.“As you can see, there are martyrs all over the place,” he said, pointing to two dead bodies under the rubble. “[There are] bodies hanging over the walls.”Another Palestinian woman, in footage verified by Al Jazeera, said she lost multiple members of her family.“Both my sons with their entire families were killed. My unmarried daughter was also killed,” the woman said, weeping. “And my other daughter with her five children – all killed. What wrong did they do? What did those innocent people do to be slaughtered like this?”Rabie al-Shandagly, a 30-year-old survivor, told the AFP news agency that most of the victims were women and children.“The explosion happened at night and I first thought it was shelling, but when I went out after sunrise, I saw people pulling bodies, limbs and the wounded from under the rubble,” he said. “People are trying to save the injured, but there are no hospitals or proper medical care.”At the Kamal Adwan Hospital, the main medical facility serving the people of north Gaza, dozens of wounded people arrived seeking treatment, but the hospital’s director said there were no staff to treat the patients as Israeli forces had arrested most of its workers in a raid last week.“The Kamal Adwan Hospital and the entire vicinity is a war zone. The hospital is left with no resources; no medical supplies; no medical staff. This is because many of our specialised doctors and surgeons have been detained,” Dr Hussam Abu Safiya said.He described chaotic scenes with patients and the injured “strewn all over” the hospital floor, and called for urgent international intervention.In Washington, DC, a spokesman for the US State Department expressed concern.“This was a horrifying incident with a horrifying result,” Matthew Miller told reporters. “We have reached out to the government of Israel to ask what happened here.”In Geneva, a spokesman for UN’s OHCHR called for a prompt, transparent and detailed investigation.“It is imperative for Israel to allow emergency rescue services access to such sites in North Gaza. In some cases, rescue workers themselves have been attacked while trying to reach the injured,” Jeremy Laurence said.The UN’s Middle East peace envoy also condemned the attack.“This horrific strike is yet another in a deadly series of recent mass casualty incidents, alongside a massive displacement campaign, in the north of Gaza that raises serious concerns about violations of international humanitarian law,” Tor Wennesland said in a statement.“I unequivocally condemn the widespread killing and injury of civilians in Gaza, and the endless displacement of the population in Gaza.”Israel’s yearlong war has so far killed at least 43,061 Palestinians in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to Palestinian officials.",Israel again bombs Gaza’s Beit Lahiya hours after killing 93 in one strike,2025-06-24T20:14:41.082907Z

I have spoken to colleagues who are beside themselves, trying to do whatever they can with the limited supplies they have in the Gaza Strip.“The needs are as vast yet as simple as they ever have been: families need food, water, medicine and shelter. Any further prevention of access to these basic supplies will worsen what is already a catastrophic and completely man-made humanitarian disaster,” she said.The current conflict between Israel and the views of the international community does not exist in isolation but is the latest in a string of confrontations Israel has had with the UN.On Tuesday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied on its Hebrew X account the historical fact of the UN’s role in Israel’s establishment, claiming that Israel was founded solely through “victory…in the War of Independence”, which is what Israel calls the conflict that resulted in the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their homes in 1948.Translation: “Prime Minister’s Office: A reminder to the president of France: It was not the UN resolution that established the State of Israel, but rather the victory achieved in the War of Independence with the blood of heroic fighters, many of whom were Holocaust survivors – including from the Vichy regime in France.”The English-language account did not carry a similar post.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has been barred from entering Israel over what the government says is his failure to “fully condemn” a missile strike by Iran on Israel in October.“The UN matters to people in Israel. That the country was founded by UN charter [in 1948] is part of the collective memory,” analyst Nimrod Flaschenberg said from Tel Aviv.“However, we’ve been seeing a gradual process of delegitimisation of the UN throughout the last few decades, when it has been portrayed as a bastion of anti-Israel or even anti-Semitic sentiment by Israel’s leaders.”Ironically, one of the leading critics of the UN is Netanyahu, himself Israel’s former ambassador to the body from 1984 to 1988.Under his right-wing Likud party – in power since 2009 – and more recently during its alliance with Israeli extreme-right and ultra-Orthodox factions, confrontations have grown with the UN and, with them, the international body’s legitimacy challenged in the eyes of many.“The UN often makes it easy for its critics,” Flaschenberg cautioned. “Guterres [the former secretary-general of Portugal’s Socialist Party] is a problem for many,” he said, describing the distrust of left-wing and liberal thought among Israel’s growing right wing.Flaschenberg explained that “the UN Human Rights Council’s ‘obsession’ with Israel/Palestine is undeniable. The fact that a disproportionate amount of time is dedicated to us, makes it easy for Israeli critics of the UN to call it anti-Semitic.”Contacted by Al Jazeera, a spokesperson for the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said, “The mandate of the high commissioner is to promote – universally and specifically with member states – the respect and protection of human rights in accordance with applicable international law and standards.”Referring to High Commissioner Volker Turk, the spokesperson continued: “The high commissioner carries out his mandate impartially irrespective of by whom, when or where abuses and violations of international human rights law are committed.“All actions of the Office are based on facts obtained through a rigorous monitoring and reporting methodology and assessed in accordance with relevant international legal standards (International Human Rights Law and International humanitarian law),” he added.Earlier this year, the international community’s report on Israel’s action in Gaza, Anatomy of a Genocide, which contained numerous documented instances of rights abuses, was dismissed as biased or anti-Semitic by both Israel and its close military and diplomatic ally, the United States.The US has also led condemnation of the UN’s open-ended Commission of Inquiry (COI) into the frequent accusations against Israel for its breaches of international human rights law in its treatment of the Palestinians under its control.The same year, UN Watch, an NGO described by the AFP news agency as “a lobby group with strong ties to Israel”, claimed that the UN General Assembly (UNGA) had adopted 15 resolutions against Israel, compared with seven against the rest of the world.Two of the UN’s 2023 resolutions concerned Israel’s actions in Gaza of that year, where more than 20,000 people had been killed.Other resolutions reinforced previous rulings, such as those condemning Israel’s settlements in the occupied West Bank, or the construction of its security barrier, condemned as an apartheid measure by numerous rights groups.Still others included the environmental damage Israel was charged with carrying out in the Palestinian territory it occupies, as well as in Lebanon.“Israel was both created by and early on was in violation of much of international law,” Paul Salem of the Middle East Institute said. “There’s a built-in conflict.”Almost immediately after Israel was created by UN mandate came the Nakba, the ethnic cleansing of more than 700,000 Palestinians, who to this day are refugees, barred from returning, many living in refugee camps in the occupied West Bank or neighbouring countries.Likewise, the occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, which Israel has maintained since 1967, puts it on the wrong side of the fourth Geneva Convention and demonstrates its disregard for UN edicts and international law, seen as inviolable the world over.Some areas of dispute between the UN and Israel are more recent. Principally, the bills banning UNRWA from the Palestinian territories where it is most needed and the ongoing attacks on UN forces operating to enforce a resolution that Israel had been party to.However, as Israel extends its war in Gaza northwards, its invading forces in Lebanon have come up against the UN forces operating there under international mandate.“UNIFIL is in the way. They want them out of the way but this is not a legitimate or legal way to do it,” Salem said, pointing to diplomatic and legal restraints that protect UN peacekeepers.“Perhaps Israel should withdraw from the UN and no longer claim that it wants to resolve things through diplomacy.“Diplomacy is frustrating, I get it. It doesn’t always work, but that’s why the UN was created, so that things are not resolved by military force,” he said.That the UN has changed since Israel’s creation is a fact.The 51 member states in the UN that gave birth to Israel have grown to a General Assembly (UNGA) of 193 as countries gained their independence from colonisers.In the UNGA, most of the world’s countries view the Palestinian cause as important.Likewise, recently Israel has diverged even more dramatically from other members of the GA.“I am pessimistic about Israel’s future as a liberal democratic state,” Richard Caplan of Oxford University said.“At the moment, Israel is in survival mode, responding to immediate threats with blatant disregard for international humanitarian law, notwithstanding its repeated assertions that it operates the ‘most moral armed forces’ in the world.”Even during a relatively optimistic period, with the Israeli economy strong after the COVID pandemic and relations between Israel and some Arab states warming, Caplan noted, Israel chose not to seek a political settlement to its conflict with Palestine and, by extension, help heal the rift with the UN.“To the contrary, the brutal colonisation of the Occupied Territories continued unabated, with Netanyahu pledging to prevent the emergence of a Palestinian state,” Caplan wrote by email.“While there may be broad opposition to Netanyahu among Israelis, by and large Israelis tolerate, if not support, the occupation.“Who are the members of the Knesset who have been elected on a platform to end the occupation? The only hope may be if Israel’s allies work earnestly towards establishing a Palestinian state and use their leverage … to pressure Israel to alter its behaviour.” he wrote.“Otherwise I fear the future will bring more deracination, more ethnic cleansing, more violence.”",Israel’s ‘war’ against the UN,2025-06-24T20:34:04.668932Z

There is no proof whatsoever.”Al-Zeer explained that he learned about the sanctions earlier this week through media reports. On Monday, the US Department of the Treasury identified al-Zeer as one of three individuals sanctioned for alleged ties to the Palestinian group Hamas, which it called a “terrorist” organisation.The Treasury accused al-Zeer, who lives in the UK and Germany, of being a “senior Hamas representative” who played “a central role in the terrorist group’s European fundraising”.But al-Zeer, the chairman of the European-Palestinian Council for Political Relations, refuted that accusation in a press release on Thursday.Speaking to Al Jazeera afterwards, he explained he never engaged in any financial activities during his years of activism in Europe, including when he served as president of the Palestinian Return Centre, a UK-based advocacy group.“Israel just doesn’t want any activists to work for the sake of Palestine. That’s the whole story,” he said.For al-Zeer, the US’s decision is a reflection of its “broader alignment” with Israel.The US has been a steadfast ally of Israel ever since the country was founded in 1948. That support has continued despite Israel’s current war in Gaza, which has prompted concerns about civilian casualties and human rights abuses.“I am deeply perplexed by the approach taken to reach and announce this decision by a country that supposedly prides itself on legal integrity,” al-Zeer said in his press release.The sanctions were announced on October 7, the anniversary of Hamas’s attack on southern Israel, which killed an estimated 1,139 people.Israel’s response in Gaza, meanwhile, has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians in the year since.“As we mark one year since Hamas’s brutal terrorist attack, [the] Treasury will continue relentlessly degrading the ability of Hamas and other destabilising Iranian proxies to finance their operations and carry out additional violent acts,” Treasury Secretary Janet L Yellen said in a statement.Al-Zeer was sanctioned along with three other individuals and nine businesses that the US Treasury claimed “play critical roles in external fundraising for Hamas, often under the guise of charitable work”.The two other designated individuals are based in Italy and Austria, where they are involved with Palestinian advocacy groups. The Treasury Department also designated a former Yemeni politician living in Turkey and his businesses.The sanctions effectively freeze the four men’s assets in the US and prevents people in the US from doing business with them.“The Treasury Department will use all available tools at our disposal to hold Hamas and its enablers accountable, including those who seek to exploit the situation to secure additional sources of revenue,” Yellen said.The US has announced several rounds of sanctions targeting financial support for Hamas. It has also sanctioned a handful of Israeli settlers and groups supporting illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.Monday’s sanctions were not the first time al-Zeer was accused of being a Hamas operative. In 2019, he won a legal case after World-Check, an influential customer-screening database used by banks, categorised him as linked to “terrorism”.Al-Zeer said the US sanctions cited a photograph that showed him with the late Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, whom Israel assassinated in Iran earlier this year.But he argued the photograph was taken as part of a larger delegations with several European representatives, including British Labour leader Sir Gerald Kaufman. “It is almost laughable,” he said of the evidence.He pledged to combat the accusations. “I have already begun, with the support of a legal team, the necessary legal procedures to challenge these baseless allegations and defend my rights.”",Prominent Palestinian activist slams US sanctions as ‘madness’,2025-06-24T20:35:15.923688Z

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) says at least 128 journalists and media workers are among the more than 41,000 people killed since Israel launched the devastating war on Gaza in October 2023.Colleagues and the Government’s Media Office in Gaza confirmed Hamad’s death, saying the journalist’s home was deliberately attacked to silence him after he received threats.“Hassan Hamad, the journalist who did not live past the age of 20, resisted for a full year in his own way. He resisted by staying away from his family so they wouldn’t be targeted. He resisted when he struggled to find an internet signal, sitting for an hour or two on the rooftop just to send the videos that reach you in seconds,” a post on Hamad’s X account posted by his colleague said.“At 6am (03:00 GMT), he called me to send his last video. After a call that didn’t last more than a few seconds, he said, ‘There they are, there they are, it’s done,’ and hung up,” the colleague added.According to footage verified by Al Jazeera, Hamad’s body was found in pieces and had to be put into bags and boxes after the Israeli attack.“This is what remains of his body,” one of his colleagues shared in an Instagram post.Hamad had been documenting Israel’s war in Gaza for more than a year and worked as a freelance TV reporter.Palestinian journalist Maha Hussaini said that a few days before Hamad’s death, he had been threatened by an Israeli officer through a Whatsapp message and several calls, ordering him to stop filming in Gaza.“‘Listen, If you continue spreading lies about Israel, we’ll come for you next and turn your family into […] This is your last warning’…” Hussaini posted on X, sharing the message Hamad had received.The Israeli government has not yet commented on his death.“Every time a journalist is killed, injured, arrested, or forced to go to exile, we lose fragments of the truth,” CPJ Program Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna said in a statement on Friday.“Those responsible for these casualties face dual trials: one under international law and another before history’s unforgiving gaze,” he added.","Palestinian journalist, 19, killed in Israeli raid after receiving threats",2025-06-24T20:41:30.120049Z

Correspondents with the AFP news agency also reported hearing loud explosions in both cities.The Hodeidah strikes hit the airport and the Katheib area, which has a Houthi-controlled military base, Al Masirah said. Footage on social media verified by Al Jazeera’s fact-checking agency showed large plumes of smoke resulting from the strikes in Hodeidah.At least one strike hit Dhamar province, and air raids took place in Bayda province, southeast of Sanaa, the Houthi media office also said.“These actions were taken to protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for US, coalition, and merchant vessels,” CENTCOM said in its post on X, adding that the strikes took place at around 1400GMT.The Associated Press news agency, quoting unnamed US officials, said the strikes targeted weapons systems, bases and other equipment belonging to the Houthis.Al Masirah, which did not elaborate on any damage or casualties, said the United Kingdom also participated in the attacks.But the UK Ministry of Defence has categorically denied any involvement in the strikes, according to an official who spoke to the Al Jazeera office in London.Washington has repeatedly struck Houthi targets in Yemen since January in response to attacks by the group on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.The Houthis say their strikes, which have disrupted maritime traffic in a globally important waterway, target vessels linked to Israel and are intended to signal solidarity with Palestinians and opposition to Israel’s war on Gaza.Now as the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, another Iran-backed group, escalates with Israeli strikes killing about 2,000 people in Lebanon, the Houthis are also demanding Israel halt its assault there.Israel has also struck Yemen with Israeli strikes on Hodeidah last month killing at least five people after the group said it targeted Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport with a missile.The latest strikes came a day after the Houthis said they carried out a drone attack on Tel Aviv. The Israeli military said it intercepted “a suspicious aerial target” off central Israel overnight without giving further details.The attacks also come just days after the Houthis threatened “escalating military operations” targeting Israel after they apparently shot down a US military drone flying over Yemen. And just last week, the group claimed responsibility for an attack targeting American warships.The rebels fired more than a half-dozen ballistic missiles and antiship cruise missiles and launched two drones at three US ships that were travelling through the Bab al-Mandeb strait, but all were intercepted by navy destroyers, according to several US officials.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet publicly released.On Friday, thousands of people took to the streets of Sanaa to express solidarity with the Palestinians and Lebanese people amid intensified attacks by Israel.“The aggression on the capital and Yemeni governorates after the … solidarity marches with Lebanon and Gaza is a desperate attempt to terrorise our people,” Houthi official Hashem Sharaf al-Din told Al Masirah.“Yemen will not be deterred by these attacks and will continue its steadfastness in confronting the enemies with all its strength.”",US air strikes target Houthis in several cities in Yemen,2025-06-24T20:45:35.750219Z
